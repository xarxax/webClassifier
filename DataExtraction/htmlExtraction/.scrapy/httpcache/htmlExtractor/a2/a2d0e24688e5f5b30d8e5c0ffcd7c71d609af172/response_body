<DIV CLASS="attrib">A book review by <a href="http://danny.oz.au/">Danny Yee</a> &#0169; 2000 http://dannyreviews.com/</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="main">
In the early hours of Sunday December 8th, 1811, four people in the East
End of London, near the Ratcliffe Highway, were brutally murdered; twelve
days later a nearby household of three met the same fate.  Until Jack the
Ripper almost eighty years on, this was to be the most prominent murder
case of nineteenth century London, taken up by the national newspapers and
raised in Parliament.  
<P>
In <EM>The Maul and the Pear Tree</EM> detective novelist P.D. James and police
historian T.A. Critchley revisit these murders, describing the discoveries
of the crimes, the public response and the frantic but ineffectual
hue and cry, and the death in prison of suspect John Williams, who was
then buried at a crossroads with a stake through his heart.  In a final
chapter they reinterpret the evidence, attempting both to clear Williams
("virtually condemned and his memory vilified on evidence so inadequate,
circumstantial and irrelevant that no competent court of law would
commit him for trial") and to uncover the real authors of the murders
(and possibly of Williams' death as well).
<P>
James and Critchley allow this story its natural drama, without
resorting to unnecessary fictionalisation or exaggeration.  They also
use it to illustrate how law enforcement at the time worked &#8212; or failed
to work.  London in 1811 had no centralised police force, but relied on
uncoordinated action by local magistrates supervising a few policemen,
the parish watch, and in this case the Thames River Police and the
recently created Bow Street Runners.  Parliamentary moves, following
the Ratcliffe Highway murders, to reform the system of nightwatchmen
came to nothing: not until 1829 was the Metropolitan Police established.
