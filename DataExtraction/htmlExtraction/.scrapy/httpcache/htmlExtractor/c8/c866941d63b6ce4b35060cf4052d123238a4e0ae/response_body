            An Easy Publication for a Difficult End            </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">            by            <A href="mailto:nepaliaama@yahoo.com">Anne Wullschlager</A> </P>

          <P align="left" class="bodytext">John Keats is one of the most,
              if not the most beloved poet of Romanticism. However, he did not
              fit neatly into the framework of the Romantic
            era. Keats was not old enough to be a part of the founding group
            with Wordsworth and Coleridge, but unlike his upper-class contemporaries
            Shelly and Byron, Keats was of the middle working class. His life
            is somehow much more solitary in relation to these other men. He
            seems here nor there, but nevertheless exceptional. There is something
            sympathetically attractive about this outsider state, which is compounded
            by the tragic course of events leading to an early death at the age
            of 26 in February 1821. The shattering death of his brother Thomas
            Keats December 1, 1818, and a renewal of spirit through the engagement
            to Fanny Brawne that same December, culminated in a spring of morbid
            creation, in a year which has been called Keats&iacute; &quot;Annus
            Mirabilis&quot; or &quot;The Year of Miracles.&quot; It was indeed
            his most successful period, writing a number of his best works with
            seeming ease in may. His famous Ode to a Nightingale was published
            in July with virtually no effort and commended for its lyrical beauty
            and realistic depth. He had arrived on the brink of something, on
            the brink of marriage, of sickness, of realizing more deeply his
            own mortality, and his own genius.</P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">              <B>Composition and Publication </B> </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">The composition and publication
              of Ode to a Nightingale is a soothing moment in a life marked with
              tragedy and rejection. Although simple,
            it is virtually an ideal story of creation and publication; a natural,
            unconcerned, and instantaneous exit from the poet&iacute;s mind to
            paper and from the poet to a public audience. Although the exact
            date of composition is uncertain, it came short after Ode to Psyche
            sometime in the second half of May 1819. Charles Brown, one of Keats&iacute; closest
            companions and in whose house Keats commonly resided, recalls the
            moment when Keats wrote the poem in a letter to Lord Houghton: </P>

              </BLOCKQUOTE>
          </div>
          <BLOCKQUOTE><P align="left" class="bodytext">In the spring of 1819 a nightingale had built her next near my
              house. Keats felt a tranquil and continual joy in her song; and
              one morning he took his chair from the breakfast table to the grass-plot
              under a plum-tree, where he sat for two or three hours. When he
              came into the house, I perceived he had some scraps of paper in
              his hand, and these he was quietly thrusting behind some books.</P>
          </BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">Indeed, Keats did compose the
              eighty lines into eight impressively regular stanzas in a single
              morning. It was written on two half sheets.
            The stanzas are easy to order and the writing is extremely clear,
            with few simple corrections. There also appears to be an abandoned
            beginning at the bottom of the page on the opposite side from the
            proper beginning. The pages are crumpled and torn about the edges,
            supporting Brown&iacute;s memory of him &quot;thrusting&quot; the
            poem in the back of a bookshelf. </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">When Keats finally removed the
              poem from that place is hard to tell, although we know that within
              a month&iacute;s time of the first (
            basically final) draft he recited it for Benjamin Haydon, a close
            friend and painter. Recalling this moment, Haydon writes: </P>
         
          </div>
          <BLOCKQUOTE><P align="left" class="bodytext">as we were one evening walking in the Kilburn meadows he repeated
              it to me, before he put it to paper, in a low, tremulous undertone
              which affected me extremely.</P>
          </BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">Contrary to what appears to
              be a recitation before the composition of the poem on paper, Keats
              had in fact written it down, but did
            not feel that the copy he had was ready to hand over for publication,
            which his recitation that day, lead Haydon to encourage. Haydon was
            an intimate ally with James Elmes the editor of a magazine called &quot;Annals
            of the Fine Arts.&quot; On Monday the fourteenth of June, Keats sent
            Elmes a copy of the poem and it appeared in the July 1819 issue,
            anonymous, but signed with a dagger. This was a clear response to
            earlier critics, who harshly reviewed such works as Edymion. He wanted
            to send Ode to a Nightingale out into the world free of the negative
            prejudice which the critics had encumbered him with. It was gracefully
            welcomed and acknowledged, hushing the anxiety of criticism and reassuring
            Keats that he had arrived at a form that agreed with his own particular
            genius. </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">After this primary publication,
              he began organizing his poems for a collective volume. He worked
              on his poems intensely in January
            1820. He spent time copying a few of them, particularly Ode to a
            Nightingale for his brother George, who had returned to London for
            a brief time to gather funds. Shortly after, on February 3, Keats
            suffered his first severe lung hemorrhage and was diagnosed with
            Tuberculosis. Right after his second sever haemorrhage on June 22,
            the volume &quot;Lamia,&quot; &quot;The Eve of St. Agnes,&quot; and
            other poems was published July 1 or 2 1820 by Taylor and Hessey. </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">This publication includes some
              minor, but marked changes from the original version of the poem
              in the &quot;Annals of the Fine Arts.&quot; The
            word &quot;fairy&quot; in line 70 is changed to &quot;faery.&quot; This
            change is documented to have taken place long after the original
            draft. The change suggests that Keats did not want to directly convey
            the atmosphere of an imaginary land of nymphs and lovely winged creatures.
            By changing the spelling he removed it one step from the over romanticized
            version of the imaginative realm of fairies, and more clearly conveys
            the &quot;faery-land of old romance, of King Arthur and Palmerin.&quot; (Amy
            Lowell, pg. 253). Although it is interesting to note that &quot;fairy&quot; is
            still used in the second edition of Romanticism an Anthology, edited
            by Duncan Wu. The timing of two other corrections is more difficult
            to determine, because they appear on the first draft. The original &quot;wide
            casements&quot; became &quot;the magic casements,&quot; and the &quot;keelless&quot; sea
            was now &quot;perilous.&quot; The changes have since been praised
            and the whole volume was well reviewed. Soon after this triumph the
            doctor assures him he won&iacute;t survive another winter in England
            and on September 17 sets sail for Italy.</P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">              <B>Why the Poem deserved such a perfect fable of publication </B> </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">The meaning of this poem is
              in its perfect expression of the imperfect reality of experience.
              The fundamental flaw between the morbid banality
            and ecstatic beauty of life is too universally understood for this
            poem to enter the world with any conflict. The trajectory of its
            creation and publication is also bordered with two opposing realities;
            in December of 1818, Keats was supposedly engaged to his beloved
            Fanny Brawne, and yet a short while after the poem&iacute;s completion
            he began to show signs of his terminal state of health. The poem
            seems to intertwine these two pressures so that one feels a harmonic
            resonance, a quivering space between these two realities. Keats was
            on the edge of crossing over into the next stage of life, where death
            is ever- present. This poem is the interplay of those two realms.
            Keats&iacute; true genius seems to reside in that state of limbo,
            that falling back and forth between where the heart and imagination
            can briefly take us, and where painful experiences of life and death
            ultimately deliver us. </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">The poem fuses &quot;real melancholy&quot; with &quot;imaginary
            relief&quot; (Leigh Hunt) to adequately express the double life of
            human experience. The poem&iacute;s movement through the different
            modes is achieved through a loose stylistic perfection; a dream-like
            experience of intoxication done with intense stanzaic regularity.
            Ode to a Nightingale not only waxes and wanes between these realms,
            it vibrates deeply with a true look at what Keats in his life has
            endured, and foreshadows the death to come. Within the beauty there
            is still the ever-present, unrelenting mortality of man to ground
            us: &quot;Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;/Where palsy
            shakes a few, sad, last grey hairs,/where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin,
            and dies&quot; (Keats, ln. 24-6). Although, he is not too forlorn
            to take flight in the ecstasy of his own creative imagination and
            poetry. He allows the bird song to carry him off: &quot;Away! Away!
            For I will fly to thee&quot; (Keats, ln. 31). He escapes &quot;the
            dull brain&quot; (Keats, ln. 34) and forgets himself long enough
            to see &quot;the Queen Moon is on her throne,/Clustered around by
            all her starry fays&quot; (Keats, ln. 37-8). Stanzas 4 and 5 suppress
            the pain, which he returns to for the last three. However, we do
            not feel betrayed in either direction or pulled too far to one side
            or the other, and in the conclusion are left to wonder which realm
            is reality: &quot;Was it a vision, or a waking dream?/Fled is that
            music - do I wake or sleep?&quot; (Keats, ln. 79-80). </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">The relationship of the poem
              to the story of its emergence and publication is a rather bizarre
              avenue of exploration, because it does not follow
            the rules of cause and effect. It suggests rather some sort of simultaneous
            intuitive interplay or correlation between the public handling of
            a poem and what the poem ultimately says. In this case the publication
            of Ode to a Nightingale does seem to be in concert with the poem&iacute;s
            meaning: &quot;the odes are analogous with experience as a whole&quot; (Walter
            Jackson Bate, pg. 500). The purity of its source, the single sweep
            of its composition and its immediate and unlabored publication, reasserts
            the poem as a symbol of reality itself, while being lyrically elevating,
            laced with harmonies and echoes, shadows and mutable reflections
            of a complex consciousness - as if to say it was something so fundamentally
            human that it could not be met with any resistance.</P>
