<h1>Scrouge</h1>
By Chris Blenkarn<P>

Lines written in praise of The Christmas Carol at the Wolsey Theatre,
Ipswich, on the fourteenth day of December, 1998.  Michael Keating was playing
Scrouge.<P>

<H2>By William McGonagall, Poet and Tragedian</H2>

'Twas in the year of 1998 and on the 14th day of December <br>
Which admirers of Dickens' blessed tale The Christmas Carol long will remember <br>
Who gaily journeyed from near and far unto the fair city of Ipswich<br>
Conveyed by minibus or cheap rail ticket, because none of them were rich.<p>

Beautiful Ipswich! You have a theatre of high renown, as I have heard tell <br>
It is to be found on Civic Drive near the banks of the beautiful Orwell <br>
The Wolsey is its name, I ween, and most comfortable its seating<br>
Whereon we gathered to view the play with the celebrated Mr Michael Keating.<p>

The house of Scrooge and Marley was most dismal to behold <br>
Three clerks toiled on, their hearts were warm though it was very cold <br>
Then 'midst the gloom sweet voices sang but Scrooge bade the choir, begone!<br>
Bah Humbug was his Christmas cheer which made them feel forlorn.<p>

Two gentlemen entreated Scrooge a trifle to bestow<br>
Upon the poor at Christmastide, but he filled their hearts with woe<br>
Are there no workhouses, he cried, may not they go to prison?<br>
Then let them starve and so decrease the surplus population.<p>

Seven years hence this very night did Jacob Marley die <br>
So when at the door his face peered out Scrooge gave a dreadful cry <br>
His face grew pale, his blood ran cold, it was a shock most cruel <br>
Then the face grew dim, he locked the door and supped a bowl of gruel.<p>

Bu lo, 'ere long the unhappy ghost returned, his blood to freeze!<br>
You're some undigested beef, cried Scrooge, or else a piece of cheese<br>
The apparition shook his chains and wailed most piteously<br>
If Scrooge would shun this path he trod, three spirits must he see. <p>

These words he uttered, then said he, oh look to see me no more <br>
Unto the Heavens he departed though he did not use the door<br>
The affrighted Scrooge gazed out upon many ghostly lamentations <br>
Then with fearful heart he retired to bed to await the visitations.<p>

The clock strikes one, upon the hour an unearthly spirit appears <br>
A lustrous robe of shimmering light and roller skates he wears<br>
I am the ghost of Christmas Past, arise and walk with me<br>
In dread Scrooge clasps his robe and finds himself a-rambling in the country. <p>

'Twas the place where he spent his childhood years a very long time ago<br>
Scrooge shed a tear for he who read the tale of honest Ali Baba, and also of Robinson Crusoe<br>
When his sister came to bring him home, Scrooge danced a little jig <br>
Then the spirit led him to his old master's house, whose name was Fezziwig.<p>

Scrooge gazed as they made merry, and danced the Roger De Coverley<br>
Next came his dear sweetheart who sadly spake thus "another idol has replaced me<br>
May you be happy in the life you have chosen" she sorrowfully did declare<br>
Then he saw her with all her children dear which made him tear his hair.<p>

Spirit, begged Scrooge with broken voice, remove me from this place, I pray"<br>
For he did not wish to see any more such sights for many a long day<br>
"Haunt me no longer" was his cry as he wrestled with the spectre<br>
Then with anguished heart he found himself once more in his own bedchamber.<p>

Again the bell tolled one o'clock, and a blaze of light there grew<br>
'Twas a jovial spirit, I do declare, inquiring if Scrooge his brothers knew? <br>
They walked abroad 'midst honest folk whose hearts were full of glee<br>
Where poulterers, butchers, bakers and grocers shops were very fine for to see<p>

Then to Bob Cratchit's humble dwelling the ghost did quickly haste, without delay<br>
Mrs Cratchit had a goose and mashed potatoes cooked, who in ribbons was very gay<br>
Bob came from church with Tiny Tim a-hobbling on his crutch<br>
Then they all sat down to enjoy their meal though there wasn't very much.<p>

"God bless us, everyone" the child this Christmas toast did give<br>
"Oh tell me, Spirit" Scrooge implored, "is Tiny Tim to live?"<br>
He answered thus, "I behold an empty seat in the chimney corner<br>
The child is like to die." These words did Scrooge's cold heart stir <p>

Next came they to where miners laboured long, it was a gloomy waste<br>
Yet the miners' hearts felt very light, they were not at all downcast<br>
Then they saw a lighthouse keeper who sang without dismay<br>
And also a ship upon the sea, mayhap bound for the silvery Tay.<p>

Now Scrooge was come to his nephew's house where the company was very fine<br>
But the ghost held up his hand as Scrooge watched this sight sublime<br>
"My life upon this globe is very brief and ends tonight"<br>
Then Scrooge espied beneath his robe a very horrid sight.<p>

Two children, pinched and twisted, and of very low degree<br>
"Their names are Ignorance and Want," the Spirit said most sternly<br>
Scrooge started back, a bell struck twelve, he lifted up his eyes<br>
To where another phantom did approach, which was not a very great surprise.<p>

This Spirit, shrouded in a robe, spake not but raised a spectral hand <br>
Scrooge feared him much, but clung to him and they came to the Stock Exchange so grand<br>
Some gentlemen spoke of one who had died, but they ne'er did shed a tear <br>
Old Scratch, they said, had got his own, which to Scrooge was not very clear  <p>

A wretched den they now approached, where a thief she brought her plunder<br>
Some bed curtains from a dying man's bed, she had rent asunder<br>
His body now lay beneath a sheet, all cold was every limb<br>
To his debtors all, his death brought cheer, there was no man for to mourn him<p>

To the Cratchit household they did wend, Scrooge felt his heart turn wild<br>
Scrooge saw Bob Cratchit as he wept "Oh my little, little child!"<br>
Thence to a wretched graveyard, of all mortals the last refuge<br>
Oh woe! The man's name upon the gravestone carved was Ebenezer Scrooge.<p>

"Spirit," cried Scrooge upon his knees, "No, Spirit,  Oh no, no!<br>
I am not the man I was, and will change my life, say it can be so."<br>
In his agony he entreated him, that sober, unspeaking ghost <br>
When all at once he found himself addressing his own bedpost.<p>

Scrooge started from his slough of despond and he flung his window wide<br>
The bells rang forth, he laughed for joy and did not feel at all tired<br>
To bestow a turkey on Bob's good wife he sent forth to the poulterer<br>
'Twas twice the size of Tiny Tim and to receive it that morn would surely delight her. <p>

The very next day Bob Scratchit crept to the house of Scrooge and Marley<br>
He was sore amazed to hear Scrooge declare he would straightway raise his salary<br>
Then to Tiny Tim Scrooge became a second father, I have heard tell.<br>
And from that day forth 'twas said of him that he knew how to keep Christmas well.<p>

Now in that theatre packed to the ceiling in every corner, both left and right<br>
The happy audience clapped and cheered for the play did all delight<br>
So a Happy and Prosperous New Year be all our festive greeting <br>
To the cast of The Christmas Carol grand, and especially to Mr Keating.<p>
