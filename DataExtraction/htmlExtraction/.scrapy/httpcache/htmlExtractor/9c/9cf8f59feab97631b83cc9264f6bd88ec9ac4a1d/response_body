  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">DecoEyes Mannequin Company: Offering the finest and
  largest selection of recast period mannequin heads and busts. DecoEyes.com is our outlet
  to share enthusiasm, knowledge, and discoveries with fellow enthusiasts in the fascinating
  field of store display mannequins. We would also like to present our concepts, techniques
  and objectives. Our specialty is display heads and busts, but we are very interested in
  anything related to the mannequin field. We would love to hear from you with any
  information that you may offer pertaining to all aspects of the display heads. We will
  also answer any and all requests to the best of our abilities.<br>
  <br>
  Our primary objective is to create precise replicas of the 1920's through 1950's display
  heads. We feel that materials, tools, paint styles, and techniques should be identical to
  those used on the originals to insure integrity of the replica. Any more or any less will
  result in an aberration better left as a bad idea. We feel strongly that a replica should
  appear identical to what the original would have looked when new in its respective era and
  unlike its new plastic age counterpart.<br>
  <br>
  They are a part of our family and we feel they deserve to be shared with the rest of the
  world.</font></p>
