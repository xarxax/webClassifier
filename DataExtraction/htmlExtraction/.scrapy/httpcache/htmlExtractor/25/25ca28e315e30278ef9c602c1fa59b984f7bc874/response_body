<h1>5-Axis Waterjet Machining Services</h1>
<p>Ormond specializes in difficult or  advanced waterjet machining processes, making it possible to generate complex  components from difficult materials.  The  technologies available at Ormond often make it possible to reduce manufacturing  costs and open up design options in applications that otherwise rely on methods  such as electric discharge machining (EDM), and chem-milling.
</p>
<p>Many unique waterjet-machining  technologies that can not be performed with commercially available tooling or  methods are made available at Ormond through in-house contract machining  services.  Ormond has large precision  5-axis machines available to implement special technologies.

<h1>Drilling</h1>
<p>
The abrasive waterjet can be used  to drill holes in difficult materials such as Inconel or ceramics.  Ormond's engineers have developed specialized  hardware and processes to drill holes as small as 0.0075 inches in  diameter.  The abrasive waterjet can be  used to drill holes at shallow angles through coated materials such as thermal  barrier coated jet engine parts.  A  common advantage of the abrasive waterjet drilling process is the improved  fatigue performance and improved hole repeatability.  In addition to drilling shaped holes, the  abrasive waterjet drilling process is capable of drilling deep holes through  difficult to machine materials.  An  example of a high aspect drilling application at Ormond is 0.084+/-0.004 inch  diameter in 3-inch thick heat treated 15-5 stainless steel.

<h1>Milling</h1>
<p>
    The patented Ormond abrasive waterjet machining technology  is used to mill controlled depth channels and pockets in challenging aerospace  and high temperature materials.  A  proprietary software package makes it possible to mill complex shapes into  contoured surfaces in materials such as nickel alloys, ceramics and tool  steels.  This has been an enabling  technology in several difficult Air Force applications, making it possible for  engine developers to push the envelope with their designs.

<a name="cavitation_peening"></a>
<h1>Cavitation Peening</h1>
<p>
Cavitation peening is a new technology that can generate  high magnitude deep compressive stresses in metals and ceramics without roughening the surface of the part.  It  is used to improve fatigue resistance and increase the size of material flaw  that can be tolerated in fatigue prone components.  It was shown to significantly increase impact  fracture damage resistance in brittle components.  Hydraulic tubing peened by Ormond for the  V-22 demonstrated increased fatigue life from less than 25,000 cycles to greater  than 500,000 cycles. 
</p>
<p>
This low cost process is capable of creating residual stresses deeper  than 0.040 inch and can be used to process very small stress-concentration features, such as between gear teeth and in thread roots.  Cavitation peening does not require the use  of shot of any kind, but uses only a jet of high velocity fluid to generate  shock waves and create residual stresses.   The peening intensity is easily controlled, by varying the process parameters.

<h1>Machining Ceramics</h1>
<p>Conventional waterjets are not capable of providing  satisfactory performance when machining some ceramics.  Commercially available nozzles are limited by  their wear resistance to abrasives that are aggressive enough to properly  machine materials like alumina, boron carbide or silicon. However Ormond has developed a new ceramic  composite nozzle that is 100 times more wear resistant than commercial nozzles  when using abrasives that cut ceramics several times faster than commonly used  garnet.  This nozzle wear resistance is  key because wear would otherwise degrade the machining process control in only  minutes.  Ormond waterjet milling rates  in silicon carbide are more than 10 times greater than diamond grinding and  without generating damaging subsurface fractures.

<h1>Custom Hardware Development</h1>
<p>
Commercial waterjet machine tool  manufacturers sell high quality equipment for supporting common waterjet  machining applications, but advanced waterjet cutting often requires  specialized tools designed to a particular application.  The engineers at Ormond are experts at  designing custom waterjet tooling to meet difficult applications.  Ormond designs and fabricates custom waterjet  tooling and accessories to support the customer’s special needs.
</p>
<p>
<b>Custom machines:</b> Customers come to Ormond because commercially available waterjet machines don’t  always meet their specific requirements.   The Ormond staff identifies the complex needs of individual customers  and single or multi-axis, large or small close tolerance machines of can be  built to their special needs.
</p>
<p>
Professional CNC controllers are  provided with these systems so customers can operate using the commercial  CAD-CAM software to generate CNC programs in the same manner that milling  machine code is generated.  Ormond  supplies custom post processors to generate waterjet CNC code using programs  such as MasterCAM&trade;.
</p>
<p>
<b>Production Tooling: </b>The  major players in the waterjet machine tool market supply a standard listing of  waterjet components and machine tools in order to address the needs of a broad  mix of customers.  Ormond can provide  support to customers who require custom tooling.
</p>
<p>
Engineers at Ormond understand the  needs of businesses that perform high volume production and custom made tooling  is designed and fabricated in order to support the high efficiency operations  necessary in high volume production.

<a name="about_waterjets"></a>
<h1>About Waterjets</h1>
<h3>Waterjets</h3>
<p>The ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) pump technology used to  create high-velocity waterjets was developed in the 1970s.  Water is pumped at pressures up to 90,000 psi  and expelled through a sapphire orifice to form a fine, coherent cutting  jet.  At this pressure, the water is  traveling at about 4,000 feet/second when it emerges from the orifice.  Waterjets typically have diameters from 0.003 to 0.020 inch, requiring 2 to 90  Hp at 55,000 psi. 
</p>
<p>
Waterjets are generally used  without the addition of abrasives to cut only soft materials such as food,  paper products, cloth, leather, wood, fiberglass, and some aerospace  composites.  It is a valued technology in  many applications due to the fact that it is easily automated and because of  its ability to cut very thin kerf widths with little material loss. 
</p>
<h3>Abrasive Waterjets</h3>
<p>The capability of the UHP waterjet  was extended in the early 1980s by adding abrasives to form the  abrasive-waterjet (AWJ).  The abrasive  particles are entrained in the waterjet and transported at supersonic  velocities to cut nearly any material.   The AWJ has been shown to produce surfaces that are free from adverse  mechanical, thermal, or metallurgical effects, and have found acceptance in  cutting applications such as aerospace sheet metals and composites. 
</p>
<p>
The waterjet developed in the AWJ flows through a mixing  tube where abrasive particles are entrained in the jet.  The high-velocity water flow in the mixing  tube creates a vacuum that serves to draw air, which is used to transport  abrasives from a hopper into the nozzle via a supply hose.  A second function of the mixing tube is to  force a transfer of energy from the waterjet to the particles, while holding  the accelerated abrasive particles in a narrow collimated stream.  Garnet abrasives are commonly used as the AWJ  cutting medium. 
</p>
<p>
The AWJ has advantages over other  machining methods in many areas: </p>
<ul>
    <li>The AWJ easily  machines titanium, nickel alloys and very hard brittle materials </li>
    <li>It is a cold cutting  process, machining without creating thermal distortions or thermally driven  changes to the metallurgical and crystal structure (no brittle recast or  micro-cracks as left by laser and EDM) </li>
    <li>The workpiece sees  very low tool loads with the abrasive-waterjet and machining delicate part  features is an option </li>
    <li>Glass and ceramic  materials can be machined to complex shapes without the sub-surface flaws  created during grinding </li>
    <li>Drilling small, deep  holes is easily performed with the AWJ </li>
    <li>AWJ cuts more  materials and is faster than EDM </li>
    <li>AWJ cuts more  materials and is faster than laser with thick materials </li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>The AWJ has many advantages over  other machining technologies, but has remained a niche market in part because  of limitations involved in machining to close tolerances.  The capabilities at Ormond make it feasible  to address closer tolerance work and take advantage of AWJ benefits over a broader  range of applications.
