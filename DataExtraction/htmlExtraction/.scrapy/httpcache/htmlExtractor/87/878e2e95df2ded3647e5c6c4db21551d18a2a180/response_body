<h1>Thomas Henry Hall Caine, 1853-1931</h1>

<p><img src="zthc.jpg" alt="'The Manxman' from Vanity Fair 1896" width=136 height=225 border=0 align=left hspace=5>Born
at Runcorn, Cheshire, 14 May 1853, to a Manx father and a Cumberland
mother and brought up in Liverpool; however spent considerable time
in his youth with uncle's family in Ballaugh and Manx grandmother.
Also spent some time helping a schoolmaster uncle at Kirk
Maughold.</p>

<p>Consumate self publicist and not always entirely truthful - not for nothing did Vivien Allen choose the punning subtitle 
  "Portrait of a Victorian Romancer" for her biography. Hall Caine's own biography "<a href="../../fulltext/hcms1908/index.htm">My 
  Story</a>" contains few hard facts and where his early connection with the Island is concerned is somewhat misleading.</p>

<p>At times he postured as more Manx than the Manx who, though they
elected him MHK for many years, were deeply suspicious of him and
never warmed to him. Caine would appear to have recognised this for
in his note to "<cite>Recollections of Rossetti</cite>" he writes of
this Manx Schoolmastering period 'I had few books of poetry and I had
none of fiction, for what we afterwards called the Nonconformist
conscience had already penetrated our bleak solitude and our seniors
had no place for the authors who (as an unforgiving Manxman in later
years said of myself) "earned their living by telling lies".' Samuel
Norris, another comeover, who had personal memories of Hall Caine
barely conceals his dislike in his joint biography of Caine and the
undoubtedly greater <a href="teb.htm">T.E.Brown</a> (another writer
who, though definitely Manx born, was treated with suspicion as
'laughing at the Manx'.)</p>

<p>For a thirty year period from c.1890 his novels, generally running to well over 300 pages sold in their 100,000s - his 
  plays were also successful in the Edwardian theatre and he was by far and away the most highly paid novelist of his day. 
  His friendship of Rossetti in his final drug-problemed years also gives Caine a claim to fame. For details of his friendship 
  with 'Jack the Ripper' see Vivien Allen's excellent biography.</p>

<h3>Marriage</h3>

<p>Hall Caine's early 'married' life was unconventional, whilst
staying in London in 1882 with a bachelor friend, the two had their
evening meals brought in from a nearby coffee shop. The two young
girls who worked there formed an attachment to the young journalists
- this was exploited by the girls' fathers to pressurise the pair
into making 'honest women' of the pair. Although it is likely that
only mild flirting had taken place, his friend Robinson agreed to
marry his girl but Caine was left with the 13 year old Mary Chandler,
who however adored him. Whilst he could legally marry her, Caine felt
she was too young (and very likely he was not in the mood to marry)
but did offer to pay for her education (yet another theme that landed
up in his novels). However in December 1882 Mary's stepfather threw
her out and Hall Caine took her into his small lodgings. Like Hall
Caine, who was small at 5'3", Mary too was small, pretty and with a
charming voice; many of his friends assumed that he too had bowed to
pressure and married her. Soon afterwards he sent her to Sevenoaks to
acquire some schooling and spent his free weekends with her. To keep
her company he allowed his young <a href="../../mquart/mq14196.htm#201">sister
Lily</a>, then aged 13, to stay with her - she was sworn to secrecy
so that news of this strange arrangement did not leak back to his
Baptist chapel-going parents in Liverpool. Lily and Mary became
lifelong friends and Lily, who adored her elder brother, kept her
promise and no news leaked out until Hall Caine told them himself. As
might be expected Mary became pregnant in 1884 at the age of 14 - by
April, Mary and a housekeeper were installed at a house in Hampstead
(Hall Caine found new lodgings near the Law Courts) and Ralph Hall
Caine was born 15 August 1884. Delaying registering the birth for a
month Hall Caine perjured himself by describing the mother as "Mary
Alice Caine, formerly Chandler" - they were not actually to marry
until 3 September 1886, by declaration in Edinburgh, so that Hall
Caine could avoid any bad publicity. Even then he romanced somewhat,
giving her age as 23 whereas she was only 17 to his 33.</p>

         <p>Hall Caine moved to the Island in 1894. Initially the
         Caines rented Greeba Castle (not a castle but one of a pair
         of castellated houses built 1849 and designed by <a href="../archtcts/jrobnsn.htm">John
         Robinson</a> of Douglas) standing above the Douglas-Peel
         road. They later took a house in Peel before buying Greeba
         Castle (by then in a poor state of repair) in 1896 which
         remained his home until his death in 1931.</p>

<p> His house became, like those of today's Hollywood stars, a place for
tourists to gawp at - many postcards both of the house and/or Hall
Caine were issued. An interesting comment on the back of that
illustrated says "on way back passed the owner, funny looking
chap"!</p>

      <td valign=top>
         <p>His architectural training was used in his remodelling of
         the house - the old door in the south face approached by
         steep steps was replaced by a new one on the west face
         approached by a terrace. This explains the drive shown above
         which apparently terminates at some windows. He and his wife
         were often photographed on this balustraded terrace, or as
         he called it 'the piazza'.</p>

<p>Hall Caine was knighted in 1918.</p>

<h3>Genealogy</h3>

<p>Some connection to Hall Caine is claimed by many of Manx descent
(though I have seldom heard the same claim made on the Island!).</p>

<p>The family at Ballaugh described by Hall Caine in his
autobiography with whom he stayed, at the impressionable age of 5,
for the summer of 1858, following the birth of his sister were as
given in 1851 census:</p>

<p>Isabella Cain widow, (Hall Caine's paternal Grandmother) 64<br>
William Cain , head of family, unmarried Butcher, (his uncle) 30 <font color="#FF0000">[sic - should be 39 or 40 - his age was correctly reported in 1841 census]</font><br>
James Cain , unmarried Stone Mason, 27<br>
Eliza, unmarried, 15.</p>

<p>Hall Caine's grandparents William and Isabel Clarke married at
Ballaugh 18 June 1811 and had the following 10 children (dates bapt or
birth)<br>

   son David Day) Lily often acted in Hall Caine's plays</blockquote>

<p>Grandfather William died 1844, Isabella on 28 Jan 1866 after which
Hall Caine spent his summer holidays with his Aunt Catherine Teare.
His aunt Catherine had married James Teare at Braddan on 23 October
1858. James was schoolmaster at Maughold 1861-1870; they had 6
children before James died from tuberculosis in December 1871.</p>

<p>It was the death of his beloved maternal grandfather, Ralph Hall,
in January 1870, that affected him deeply - towards the end of 1870
he gave up his job as draughtsman in an Architect's office in
Liverpool and went to stay with his aunt. As James Teare was already
seriously ill, Hall Caine's arrival was welcomed as he could assist
in the school. He stayed on the Island for over a year - restoring a
deserted tholtan near the school as his Aunt's house would be
somewhat crowded. It is the insights and material which he acquired
at this time that he would recycle in his later Manx stories - much
to the annoyance of those who recognised themselves. He did however
fall in love with Maughold Head, even to the extent of buying, in
1909, a plot on the head for his grave, but when in 1931 shortly
before his death he found he could not manage the climb (and
disliking the thought that others would not then make the pilgrimage
to it that he hoped for) he bought a plot in Maughold yard where one
can see the huge memorial stone.</p>

<p>TBC</p>
<p><a href="thcp1909.htm">Punch in 1909</a> made fun of the common complaint that 
  Hall Caine's stories were all variations on the same theme. His passion for 
  <a href="../../iln/n101091.htm">visiting countries</a> with an eye for self 
  advertisment is also mocked in the 1902 Punch cartoon </p>
