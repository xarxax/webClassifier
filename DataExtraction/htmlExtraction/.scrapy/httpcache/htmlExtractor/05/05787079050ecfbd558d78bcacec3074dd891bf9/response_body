      <h4>Company Perspective</h4>

      <p><strong>Lawrence James Associates, Inc.</strong> is a national executive search firm that 
         specializes in servicing the food and retail industry.  We are the largest 
         non-franchise operation in the United States, with offices strategically placed nationwide.
         We've been helping thousands of people reach their personal and business financial goals
         for more than 25 years. </p>

      <p>One reason for our success is the firm's belief that client loyalty and commitment must
         be placed above other considerations. We know that our long-term interests are best served by
         assisting clients in achieving their manpower and staffing objectives. The only way our firm
         can continue to grow is if we service client organizations more effectively than anyone else.
         We know who our clients are, and sustaining these business relationships is our primary
         motivating factor. </p>

      <h4>Our Web Site</h4>

      <p>If you are interested in pursuing a job opportunity, locate it on our Job Opportunities page.
         Then go to our Contact Us page, click on the Candidate Information Form, fill it out and submit
         it to us. </p> 

      <h4>Service Fees</h4>

      <p>We provide services that meet the needs of our clients. Accordingly, we offer the following
         programs: </p>

      <ul>
         <li><strong>Contingency Search</strong> - A contingency search is based on our ability to place a candidate 
             who matches the search profile. Only if we find the exceptional person that meets your
             requirements and is acceptable to you (within a twelve month period), do you pay the 
             service fee. <br /><br /></li>

         <li><strong>Retainer Search</strong> - In many situations, it is beneficial to the client to have an exclusive
             agreement with the search consultant so that our resources can be totally committed and 
             accountable within a specific time frame to complete the search assignment successfully. 
             A retainer search eliminates barriers, providing the 
             flexibility of the search consultants to identify candidates and control the search process. </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Guarantee</h4>

      <p><strong>Lawrence James Associates, Inc.</strong> believes so strongly in its ability
         to successfully complete assignments, we are willing to back our candidate with the 
         following guarantee to assure clients of our commitment: </p>

      <p id="home_box">If for any reason beyond the client's control, the new employee does not 
         remain in their employ for at least 90 days, we will replace the position at no additional fee. </p>
