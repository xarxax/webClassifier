					<h2><a name="Anchor-my"></a>my e.e. cummings top 10 lists</h2>
					<p><b>(Last update: <csobj w="175" h="18" t="DateTime" format="LongDate" region="0">Tuesday, October 21, 2008</csobj>) </b></p>
					<p>Truth be told, a couple of my favorite e.e. cummings poems don't appear to be findable on the Web. The following ones, however, were extant as of mid-August, 2002. Liveright Publishing, a division of <a href="http://www.wwnorton.com" target="new">W.W. Norton &amp; Co.</a>, owns the rights to cummings' work; copyright resides with the E.E. Cummings Copyright Trust. (My copy of <u>Complete Poems 1913-1962</u> was published in 1972 by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, ironic considering that its predecessor company Harcourt, Brace was among those who were the pointed recipients of &quot;No Thanks&quot; in that volume's initial dedication.) Anyway, order yourself a copy from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/ref=s_sf_b_as/104-9188460-8353508">amazon.com</a>.</p>
					<p>Despite all the fooferaw having to do with his capitalization, punctuation, and other unconventional conventions, many cummings poems are really elegant and careful sonnets--sometimes three quatrains and a couplet, nearly as often an octave and sestet. And of course the subject matter is as traditional as can be. Here, then, some highlights.</p>
