On the development of Keats's reputation among Victorian writers. "By closely examining the publications and private correspondence of the Keats Circle during the 1820s and 1830s, one can see various patterns to the biographical development of Keats, particularly in relation to their subject's masculinity. From the widespread eulogies immediately following the poet's death, to Hunt's 1828 biographical sketch in <cite>Lord Byron and Some of His Contemporaries</cite>, to Brown's 1836 biography manuscript, threads are spun simultaneously of Keats as icon of middle-class masculinity, perpetually youthful Aesthetic ideal, and object of queered desire." <cite>Romanticism on the Net</cite> 36-37 (2004-2005).</p>

For Keats these relations are often portrayed as an auto-erotic journey that indicates the risks of confusing fiction and fact. <cite>Romanticism on the Net</cite> 20 (2000).</p>
