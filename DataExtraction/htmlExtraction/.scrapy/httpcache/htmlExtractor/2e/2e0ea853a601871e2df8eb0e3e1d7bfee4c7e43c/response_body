<p align="left">Valencian novelist, travel writer and politician born in 1867.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ibáñez achieved what most other Spanish writers only dreamed of&nbsp; -
International popularity.&nbsp; Vicente was a member of the Republican party and editor of
<em>El Pueblo</em>, an antimonarchist newspaper.&nbsp; In 1896, he was arrested because of
his political views and actions and served nearly two year's hard labor. Vicente was
eventually exiled from Spain in 1923.&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the popularity of his later
works, Ibáñez was a very wealthy man when he passed away in 1928</p>

<p align="left">His novels can be easily classified into basic genres: regional,
psychological, historical and Cosmopolitan.&nbsp; Ibáñez achieved his greatest success
from the cosmopolitan European novels, of which <em>Los cuatro jinetes del Apocalipsis </em>(The
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, 1916) is the best.&nbsp; This is a tragic and suspenseful
novel of World War I and its' effects on society.&nbsp; Other novels in this genre
include: <em>Mare Nostrum </em>(1918), and <em>Los enemigos de la mujer</em> (1919), both
of which are also war novels.</p>

<p align="left">His best novels are of the regional genre, which take place in his native
Valencia.&nbsp; These are his earliest works and they offer an intensely vivid depiction
of the social problems affecting this region and realistically portray the lives of
Valencia's citizens, including bullfighters, fishermen, and politicians.&nbsp; Vicente's
masterpiece, <em>Cañas y Barro</em> (Reeds and Mud, 1902), falls within this genre and
successfully transports the reader into the small fishing village of Albufera.&nbsp; This
novel effectively depicts the bitter conflict between different generations of fishermen,
interlaced with a tragic love story of forbidden love and its' shocking consequences.
