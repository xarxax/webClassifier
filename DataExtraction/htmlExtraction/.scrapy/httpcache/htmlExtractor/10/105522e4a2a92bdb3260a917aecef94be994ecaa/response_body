<DIV CLASS="attrib">A book review by <a href="http://danny.oz.au/">Danny Yee</a> &#0169; 2001 http://dannyreviews.com/</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="main">
Other "age of sail" naval heroes have come to rival him &#8212; Alexander
Kent's Richard Bolitho, Richard Woodman's Nathaniel Drinkwater, Dudley
Pope's Ramage, and Patrick O'Brian's <a href="Aubrey_Maturin.html">Jack Aubrey</a>, to list just a few &#8212;
but Horatio Hornblower remains for many of us the best known and most
loved.  In ten books Forester recounts Hornblower's rise from midshipman
to admiral, during the British navy's confrontation with Revolutionary
and Napoleonic France.  They are above all "rattling good yarns", with
fast-moving plots, stirring battle scenes, lively dialogue, and vivid
characters, but they also offer a picture of the British navy during the
period; and Hornblower himself is an original and memorable creation.
<P>
I recommend reading the books in the order they were written rather
than chronologically.  In the first written, <EM>The Happy Return</EM> (also
published as <EM>Beat to Quarters</EM>), we find Hornblower in command of a
frigate in lonely Pacific waters off Spanish Central America.  He has
to deal with a mad revolutionary, fight single-ship duels with a larger
vessel, and cope with Lady Barbara Wellesley (who provides a romantic
interest to the series).  In <EM>A Ship of the Line</EM> Hornblower is sent into
the Mediterranean, where he wreaks havoc on French coastal communications
before plunging into a battle against the odds.  <EM>Flying Colours</EM> is
mostly set in France: in it Hornblower escapes captivity and returns to
England a hero.  In <EM>The Commodore</EM> he is sent with a squadron into the
Baltic, where he has to cope with the complex politics of the region
as well as helping with the siege of Riga.  And in <EM>Lord Hornblower</EM>
a mutiny leads to involvement with the fall of Napoleon &#8212; and brings
him to prison and a death sentence during the Hundred Days.
<P>
Forester then went back and described Hornblower's earlier career.
<EM>Lieutenant Hornblower</EM> is perhaps my favourite of the books.  The only
novel narrated from a perspective other than our hero's &#8212; that of
his faithful friend Bush &#8212; it takes Hornblower to the West Indies,
where a mad captain and the fall of Santo Domingo test his ability
and his resolution, and where he earns the most critical promotion of
his career.  It also has some vivid scenes with Hornblower on half-pay
in London during the Peace of Amiens, playing whist for a living.
In <EM>Hornblower and the Hotspur</EM> he is part of the blockade of Brest, and
in <EM>Hornblower and the Atropos</EM> he is sent on a perilous mission into
the Eastern Mediterranean.  <EM>Mr Midshipman Hornblower</EM> and <EM>Hornblower
in the West Indies</EM> are collections of short stories rather than novels,
the latter with Hornblower an admiral near the end of his career.
<P>
Serious Hornblower fans should also check out C. Northcote Parkinson's
"<a href="Parkinson.html">biography</a>" of Hornblower.
