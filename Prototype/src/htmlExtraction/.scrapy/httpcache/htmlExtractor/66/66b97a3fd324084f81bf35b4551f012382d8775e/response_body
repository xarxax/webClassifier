														<h3> (Dairy free)</h3>
														<h2>A creamy splash of goodness!</h2>
														<div class="modal-text">
															<p> Get ready for your mouth to water! As soon as this gets into your microwave your kitchen is sure to fill with a cheesy aroma. If you are a cheese lover then this is the choice for you! Let your taste buds take a journey they will not soon forget. The best part is that this cheese flavor is DAIRY FREE! That's right, all the delight of creamy cheesiness without the concern of lactose or dairy. Want to spice it up a bit? Add some chili powder or red pepper for a hot surprise. For the ultra-cheese fanatics out there, melt some cheese over top! You can also add extra sea salt to really make the flavor pop! When popped, notice that this cheese flavor remains white, why bother with unnecessary food dye to make it "look cheesy" and let your taste buds do the judging!

															<p> Dive into our most popular flavor yet! This African inspired delight is sure to please your taste buds. A subtle ginger taste with a sweet aroma and after taste will keep you coming back for more, and more! The name "Tangawizi" is a commonly used term in eastern Africa among native Swahili speakers. It literally means "Ginger"! On a trip to Tanzania (a country located on the central east cost of Africa) our designer was given the privilege of being introduced to this delicious flavor. In parts of Tanzania it was common to find sweet ginger sprinkled on fresh popped popcorn and thus, we decided to bring it back to the states to share! Give it a taste and your taste buds will thank you! Unataka kujaribu hivyo!

															<p> One of the most popular flavors of snack foods just got a little better! NOW you can indulge in Chili Lime on your popcorn! Yes, this is inspired by our friends down south, but not where you were thinking. A long time Salvadorian friend of ours introduced us to the idea of putting lime on our popcorn. We are obviously not the only ones to do this but it is safe to say, we are the BEST! Mix that tangy lime flavor with some spicy chili and you have a match made in heaven. Don't know if it is for you? Check our testimonials and they will assure you that this is not a flavor you can miss out on! On the HEALTH side, we use natural lime flavor and real red pepper on our chili lime popcorn which helps to make this a healthy alternative to some of your other chili lime cravings!

															<p> Hot Jalapeno Butter has always been a PrimeTime hit. We had introduced this flavor a while back so you can bet that it has been perfected. A blend of spices and butter flavor has balanced this treat to satisfy those jalapeno loving fans of heat! We use red pepper in this so get ready for a burn that hits even harder after the fact. As with all of our flavors, this also has all the deliciousness with 0g of Trans fats! In the past this flavor has not been made publicly available, however, now it is easily findable on Amazon.com! Do you want some larger quantities of this product for resale or personal consumption? Just give us a call at our office or go to our distribution page for more information. Another fantastic way to enjoy this particular flavor is with some shredded cheese sprinkled on top! For the extra spice you can even use some pepper-jack cheese! The cheese melts over top of a newly popped bag and give it the perfect texture.

														<h3>(Sweet like Candy) </h3>
														<h2>sweetness you deserve</h2>
														<div class="modal-text">
															<p> As you may already know, Kettle Corn is not your average microwave popcorn. Kettle Corn is a sweet twist on the average flavors of popcorn and therefore is meant for somebody who craves a sweet yet healthy snack. Our Kettle Corn is a light yet full variation on typical Kettle Corn. Our Kettle Corn has 0g of Trans Fats and 0g of SUGAR! Pop this corn at the optimal time given for the preferred results. However, remember to consider that all microwaves are different and so they should be monitored as such. Wait until there is more than a 2 second delay between the popping and take it out of your microwave. If left popping for too long the sweetener may crystalize and give undesirable results (a burnt taste). After being popped try mixing our kettle corn with some nuts and chocolate, it is stupendous!

If Less butter, less fat and fewer calories sounds good then dig in! When coupled with a drizzle of basil or oregano, this flavor knocks others out of the ball park.

Dive into a light and buttery dream with your next PrimeTime popcorn purchase and see how reducing your butter doesn't mean reducing your enjoyment!
