<TR><TD>
<DL>
<DT>Up rose Lenore as the red morn wore,
<DD>     From weary visions starting:
<DT>"Art faithless, William, or, William, art dead?
<DD>     'Tis long since thy departing."
<DT>For he, with Frederick's men of might,
<DT>In fair Prague waged the uncertain fight;
<DT>Nor once had he writ in the hurry of war,
<DT>And sad was the true heart that sickened afar.
<P>
<DT>The Empress and the King,
<DD>     With ceaseless quarrel tired,
<DT>At length relaxed the stubborn hate
<DD>     Which rivalry inspired:
<DT>And the martial throng, with laugh and song,
<DT>Spoke of their homes as they rode along,
<DT>And clank, clank, clank! came every rank,
<DT>With trumpet-sound that rose and sank.
<P>
<DT>And here and there and everywhere,
<DD>     Along the swarming ways,
<DT>Went old man and boy, with the music of joy,
<DD>     On the gallant bands to gaze;
<DT>And the young child shouted to spy the vaward,
<DT>And trembling and blushing the bride pressed forward:
<DT>But ah! for the sweet lips of Lenore
<DT>The kiss and the greeting are vanished and o'er.
<P>
<DT>From man to man all wildly she ran
<DD>     With a swift and searching eye;
<DT>But she felt alone in the mighty mass,
<DD>     As it crushed and crowded by:
<DT>On hurried the troop, -- a gladsome group, -- 
<DT>And proudly the tall plumes wave and droop:
<DT>She tore her hair and she turned her round,
<DT>And madly she dashed her against the ground.
<P>
<DT>Her mother clasped her tenderly
<DD>     With soothing words and mild:
<DT>"My child, may God look down on thee, -- 
<DD>     God comfort thee, my child."
<DT>"Oh! mother, mother! gone is gone!
<DT>I reck no more how the world runs on:
<DT>What pity to me does God impart?
<DT>Woe, woe, woe! for my heavy heart!"
<P>
<DT>"Help, Heaven, help and favour her!
<DD>     Child, utter an Ave Maria!
<DT>Wise and great are the doings of God;
<DD>     He loves and pities thee."
<DT>"Out, mother, out, on the empty lie!
<DT>Doth he heed my despair, -- doth he list to my cry?
<DT>What boots it now to hope or to pray?
<DT>The night is come, -- there is no more day."
<P>
<DT>"Help, Heaven, help! who knows the Father
<DD>     Knows surely that he loves his child:
<DT>The bread and the wine from the hand divine
<DD>     Shall make thy tempered grief less wild."
<DT>"Oh! mother, dear mother! the wine and the bread
<DT>Will not soften the anguish that bows down my head;
<DT>For bread and for wine it will yet be as late
<DT>That his cold corpse creeps from the grim grave's gate."
<P>
<DT>"What if the traitor's false faith failed,
<DD>     By sweet temptation tried, -- 
<DT>What if in distant Hungary
<DD>     He clasp another bride? -- 
<DT>Despise the fickle fool, my girl,
<DT>Who hath ta'en the pebble and spurned the pearl:
<DT>While soul and body shall hold together
<DT>In his perjured heart shall be stormy weather."
<P>
<DT>"Oh! mother, mother! gone is gone,
<DD>     And lost will still be lost!
<DT>Death, death is the goal of my weary soul,
<DD>     Crushed and broken and crost.
<DT>Spark of my life! down, down to the tomb:
<DT>Die away in the night, die away in the gloom!
<DT>What pity to me does God impart?
<DT>Woe, woe, woe! for my heavy heart!"
<P>
<DT>"Help, Heaven, help, and heed her not,
<DD>     For her sorrows are strong within;
<DT>She knows not the words that her tongue repeats, -- 
<DD>     Oh! count them not for sin!
<DT>Cease, cease, my child, thy wretchedness,
<DT>And think on thy promised happiness;
<DT>So shall thy mind's calm ecstasy
<DT>Be a hope and a home and a bridegroom to thee."
<P>
<DT>"My mother, what is happiness?
<DD>     My mother, what is Hell?
<DT>With William is my happiness -- 
<DD>     Without him is my Hell!
<DT>Spark of my life! down, down to the tomb:
<DT>Die away in the night, die away in the gloom!
<DT>Earth and Heaven, and Heaven and earth,
<DT>Reft of William are nothing worth."
<P>
<DT>Thus grief racked and tore the breast of Lenore,
<DD>     And busy was her brain;
<DT>Thus rose her cry to the Power on high,
<DD>     To question and arraign:
<DT>Wringing her hands and beating her breast, -- 
<DT>Tossing and rocking without any rest; -- 
<DT>Till from her light veil the moon shone thro',
<DT>And the stars leapt out of the darkling blue.
<P>
<DT>But hark to the clatter and the pat pat patter!
<DD>     Of a horse's heavy hoof!
<DT>How the steel clanks and rings as the rider springs!
<DD>     How the echo shouts aloof!
<DT>While slightly and lightly the gentle bell
<DT>Tingles and jingles softly and well;
<DT>And low and clear through the door plank thin
<DT>Comes the voice without to the ear within:
<P>
<DT>"Holla! holla! unlock the gate;
<DD>     Art waking, my bride, or sleeping?
<DT>Is thy heart still free and still faithful to me?
<DD>     Art laughing, my bride, or weeping?"
<DT>"Oh! wearily, William, I've waited for you, -- 
<DT>Woefully watching the long day thro', -- 
<DT>With a great sorrow sorrowing
<DT>For the cruelty of your tarrying."
<P>
<DT>"Till the dead midnight we saddled not, -- 
<DD>     I have journeyed far and fast -- 
<DT>And hither I come to carry thee back
<DD>     Ere the darkness shall be past."
<DT>"Ah! rest thee within till the night's more calm;
<DT>Smooth shall thy couch be, and soft, and warm:
<DT>Hark to the winds, how they whistle and rush
<DT>Thro' the twisted twine of the hawthorn-bush."
<P>
<DT>"Thro' the hawthorn-bush let whistle and rush, -- 
<DD>     Let whistle, child, let whistle!
<DT>Mark the flash fierce and high of my steed's bright eye,
<DD>     And his proud crest's eager bristle.
<DT>Up, up and away! I must not stay:
<DT>Mount swiftly behind me! up, up and away!
<DT>An hundred miles must be ridden and sped
<DT>Ere we may lie down on the bridal-bed."
<P>
<DT>"What! ride an hundred miles tonight,
<DD>     By thy mad fancies driven!
<DT>Dost hear the bell with its sullen swell,
<DD>     As it rumbles out eleven?"
<DT>"Look forth! look forth! the moon shines bright:
<DT>We and the dead gallop fast thro' the night.
<DT>'Tis for a wager I bear thee away
<DT>To the nuptial couch ere the break of day."
<P>
<DT>"Ah, where is the chamber, William dear,
<DD>     And William, where is the bed?"
<DT>"Far, far from here: still, narrow, and cool;
<DD>     Plank and bottom and lid."
<DT>"Hast room for me?" -- "For me and thee;
<DT>Up, up to the saddle right speedily!
<DT>The wedding-guests are gathered and met,
<DT>And the door of the chamber is open set."
<P>
<DT>She busked her well, and into the selle
<DD>     She sprang with nimble haste, -- 
<DT>And gently smiling, with a sweet beguiling,
<DD>     Her white hands clasped his waist: -- 
<DT>And hurry, hurry! ring, ring, ring!
<DT>To and fro they sway and swing;
<DT>Snorting and snuffing they skim the ground,
<DT>And the sparks spurt up, and the stones run round.
<P>
<DT>Here to the right and there to the left
<DD>     Flew fields of corn and clover,
<DT>And the bridges flashed by to the dazzled eye,
<DD>     As rattling they thundered over.
<DT>"What ails my love? the moon shines bright:
<DT>Bravely the dead men ride through the night.
<DT>Is my love afraid of the quiet dead?"
<DT>"Ah! no; -- let them sleep in their dusty bed!"
<P>
<DT>On the breeze cool and soft what tune floats aloft,
<DD>     While the crows wheel overhead? -- 
<DT>Ding dong! ding dong! 'tis the sound, 'tis the song, -- 
<DD>     "Room, room for the passing dead!"
<DT>Slowly the funeral-train drew near,
<DT>Bearing the coffin, bearing the bier;
<DT>And the chime of their chaunt was hissing and harsh,
<DT>Like the note of the bull-frog within the marsh.
<P>
<DT>"You bury your corpse at the dark midnight,
<DD>     With hymns and bells and wailing; -- 
<DT>But I bring home my youthful wife
<DD>     To a bride-feast's rich regaling.
<DT>Come, choister, come with thy choral throng,
<DT>And solemnly sing me a marriage-song;
<DT>Come, friar, come, -- let the blessing be spoken,
<DT>That the bride and the bridegroom's sweet rest be unbroken."
<P>
<DT>Died the dirge and vanished the bier: -- 
<DD>     Obedient to his call,
<DT>Hard hard behind, with a rush like the wind,
<DD>     Came the long steps' pattering fall:
<DT>And ever further! ring, ring, ring!
<DT>To and fro they sway and swing;
<DT>Snorting and snuffing they skim the ground,
<DT>And the sparks spurt up, and the stones run round.
<P>
<DT>How flew to the right, how flew to the left,
<DD>     Trees, mountains in the race!
<DT>How to the left, and the right and the left,
<DD>     Flew the town and market-place!
<DT>"What ails my love? the moon shines bright:
<DT>Bravely the dead men ride thro' the night.
<DT>Is my love afraid of the quiet dead?"
<DT>"Ah, let them alone in their dusty bed!"
<P>
<DT>See, see, see! by the gallows tree,
<DD>     As they dance on the wheel's broad hoop,
<DT>Up and down, in the gleam of the moon
<DD>     Half lost, an airy group: -- 
<DT>"Ho! ho! mad mob, come hither amain,
<DT>And join in the wake of my rushing train; -- 
<DT>Come, dance me a dance, ye dancers thin,
<DT>Ere the planks of the marriage-bed close us in."
<P>
<DT>And hush, hush, hush! the dreamy rout
<DD>     Came close with a ghastly bustle,
<DT>Like the whirlwind in the hazel-bush,
<DD>     When it makes the dry leaves rustle:
<DT>And faster, faster! ring, ring, ring!
<DT>To and fro they sway and swing;
<DT>Snorting and snuffing they skim the ground,
<DT>And the sparks spurt up, and the stones run round.
<P>
<DT>How flew the moon high overhead,
<DD>     In the wild race madly driven!
<DT>In and out, how the stars danced about,
<DD>     And reeled o'er the flashing heaven!
<DT>"What ails my love? the moon shines bright:
<DT>Bravely the dead men ride thro' the night.
<DT>Is my love afraid of the quiet dead?"
<DT>"Alas! let them sleep in their narrow bed."
<P>
<DT>"Horse, horse! meseems 'tis the cock's shrill note,
<DD>     And the sand is well nigh spent;
<DT>Horse, horse, away! 'tis the break of day, -- 
<DD>     'Tis the morning air's sweet scent.
<DT>Finished, finished is our ride:
<DT>Room, room for the bridegroom and the bride!
<DT>At last, at last, we have reached the spot,
<DT>For the speed of the dead man has slackened not!"
<P>
<DT>And swiftly up to an iron gate
<DD>     With reins relaxed they went;
<DT>At the rider's touch the bolts flew back
<DD>     And the bars were broken and bent;
<DT>The doors were burst with a deafening knell,
<DT>And over the white graves they dashed pell mell:
<DT>The tombs around looked grassy and grim,
<DT>As they glimmered and glanced in the moonlight dim.
<P>
<DT>But see! but see! in an eyelid's beat,
<DD>     Towhoo! a ghastly wonder!
<DT>The horseman's jerkin, piece by piece,
<DD>     Dropped off like brittle tinder!
<DT>Fleshless and hairless, a naked skull,
<DT>The sight of his weird head was horrible;
<DT>The lifelike mask was there no more,
<DT>And a scythe and a sandglass the skeleton bore.
<P>
<DT>Loud snorted the horse as he plunged and reared,
<DD>     And the sparks were scattered round: -- 
<DT>What man shall say if he vanished away,
<DD>     Or sank in the gaping ground?
<DT>Groans from the earth and shrieks in the air!
<DT>Howling and wailing everywhere!
<DT>Half dead, half living, the soul of Lenore
<DT>Fought as it never had fought before.
<P>
<DT>The churchyard troop, -- a ghostly group, -- 
<DD>     Close round the dying girl;
<DT>Out and in they hurry and spin
<DD>     Through the dance's weary whirl:
<DT>"Patience, patience, when the heart is breaking;
<DT>With thy God there is no question-making:
<DT>Of thy body thou art quit and free:
<DT>Heaven keep thy soul eternally!"
