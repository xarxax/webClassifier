      <h2>CAINE MSS.</h2> <p>The Caine mss., 1891-1931, consist of papers of Sir Hall
 Caine, 1853-1931, novelist and playwright. Letters are addressed
 in 1891 and 1892 from Caine to Miss A[delaide S.] Lauprecht of
 the Midland Institute, Birmingham, [England], who had written to
 him about translating The Scapegoat into German. Other letters
 are addressed to George Bowler in 1918 concerning arrangements
 for his will; two replies from Bowler, chartered accountant of
 Liverpool, examine these arrangements. A letter from H. S. B.
 Goldsmith to Caine in 1914 was readdressed to George Bowler and
 bears the dark blue wax seal of HC.
 </p>
 
 <p>A financial ledger of loose leaves in a dark brown binder with
 "Sir Hall Caine K.B.E." on the edge covers the years 1922, Apr.
 5, to 1931, Aug. 31. Laid in the ledger is a separate leaf for
 the Isle of Man Bank, Ltd., 1931, Sept. 2-Oct. 16. Information in
 the ledger concerns deeds of conveyance which date from 1874.
 Literary Earnings and Royalties are summarized under the heading
 of Sundries in the ledger. Some ephemeral material is
 included.
 </p>
 
 <p>Collection size: 10 items</p>
 
 <p>Additions to the Caine mss., 1882-1926, consist primarily of
 letters from novelist and playwright, Hall Caine, 1853- 1931, to
 various friends, writers, and business associates. Letters in
 1882, 1888, and 1890 are addressed to William Cosmo Monkhouse,
 poet and critic, with whom Caine corresponded on matters of
 literature and art. Monkhouse wrote a review of Caine's The
 Deemster in 1888.
 </p>
 
 <p>In 1905 Caine was associated with a publication of multiple
 authorship, "Queen's Carol", the proceeds of which were to
 benefit the Queen's fund for the Unemployed. In a December form
 letter, here addressed to the Bishop of London, Caine asks for a
 statement that might be placed in the papers under the Lord
 Bishop's name.
 </p>
 
 <p>Other letters present are of both a business and personal
 nature concerning publishing activities and play productions.
 There is also one letter from Caine's sister Lily, addressed to
 William Morris Colles, that is on the verso of a letter from
 Caine himself to Colles.
 </p>
 
 <p>Corrected proof sheets of "Love of My Heart" (Graih my Chree),
 translated and adapted from Manx Gaelic, completes the
 collection.
