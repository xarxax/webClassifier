<DD>We read their stories every day, talk to
them in e-mail, chat with them on IRC... but do we really know who these
fanfic authors are?<BR><BR>
<DD>This website is dedicated to exploring the minds of the fan
author through interviews and essays.  Every month, I will spotlight a 
different author from either the anime/manga and comic book fiction worlds.
Each interview will include a link to selected stories by that author
as well as the <B>Spotlight Picks</B>.<BR><BR>

<dd>Due to circumstances beyond my control, this site is not going to be updated anymore.  I will still be maintaining this site, because I think it's a valuable resource as an insight into the minds of comic book and anime fanfic authors.  I apologize to authors who I had intended on reviewing and never got around to, plus fans of this site who had suggested authors that were in the queue to be interviewed.<BR>
<BR>

<dd>If you're a fan of my interview style, you can check out my interviews, articles, columns and reviews in <a href="http://www.sequentialtart.com">Sequential Tart</a>, an online fanzine devoted to comics, anime and all things inbetween, from a female perspective.  I may not be in every issue, but every issue is worth reading.<BR><BR>

<dd>Thanks to everyone, from the writers I interviewed to the visitors to this website, for your encouragement and support.<BR>
<BR>

<dd>Oh, and I just updated the Fanfic Glossary, too, so go read!<BR>
