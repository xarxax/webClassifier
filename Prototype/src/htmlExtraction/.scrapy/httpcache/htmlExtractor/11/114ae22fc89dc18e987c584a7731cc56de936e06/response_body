<h1><a name="poems">Poems</a></h1>
<h2>The Gardener's Daughters</h2>
<p>One fills the large Delft jugs,<br>
Painted with blue dragons and birds,<br>
With a loose sheaf of bright flowers:<br>
Among them jasmine, ripe roses unfolding,<br>
Dahlias, carnations and narcissus...</p>
<p>Tall daisies, lilac umbels and snowball<br>
Dance above them, and<br>
Stalks, silvery down and panicles sway...<br>
A fragrant bacchanal...<br>
The other with pale thin fingers picks<br>
Long-stemmed rigid orchids,<br>
Two or three for a narrow vase...<br>
Rising up with fading colors,<br>
With long styles, strange and winding,<br>
With purple threads and garish dots,<br>
With violet brown panther spots<br>
And lurking, seductive chalices<br>
Wanting to kill...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Die Töchter der Gärtnerin, 1891</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>»Works« are Dead Rock</h2>
<p>»Works« are dead rock, sprung from resounding chisel,<br>
When the master is at work, chipping away at his living self.<br>
»Works« announce the mind as pupas announce the butterfly:<br>
»Look, it left me behind – lifeless – and fluttered away.«<br>
»Works« are like reeds, Midas' whispering reeds,<br>
Spreading secrets long after having ceased to be true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>»Werke sind totes Gestein«, 1892</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Written in a Copy of 'Yesterday'</h2>
<p>Thoughts are apples on the tree,<br>
Not meant for anyone in particular,<br>
But they end up belonging<br>
To the one who takes them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>In ein Exemplar von 'Gestern', 1892</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Canticum Canticorum IV, 12-16</h2>
<p>You are the garden locked,<br>
Your childlike hands are waiting,<br>
Your lips are without violence.<br>
You are the fountain sealed,<br>
Life's frozen threshold,<br>
Tart and cold in ignorance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take wings, north wind,<br>
Come, south wind, across the hills,<br>
And blow through this grove!<br>
Let all fragrances come awake,<br>
Let life free itself</p>
<p>From sleep's frozen depth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Rose and the Desk</h2>
<p>I know that flowers never fall out of open windows by themselves. Especially
not at night. But that's beside the point. Anyway, the red rose suddenly lay
before my black patent leather shoes in the white snow covering the street. The
rose was very dark, like velvet, still slender, not yet unfolded, and without
fragrance because of the cold. I took it with me, put it in a small Japanese
vase on my desk and went to bed.</p>
<p>I woke up soon afterwards. There was a dim light in the room, not from the
moon but from the stars. Inhaling, I felt the perfume of the now warm rose drift
over and overheard a whispered conversation. The china rose on the old Viennese
ink set was dropping remarks about something. »He doesn't have any taste, any
style left,« it said, »not a trace of taste.« Meaning me. »Or else he
couldn't possibly have put something like <i>that</i> next to me.« Meaning the
live rose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Die Rose und der Schreibtisch, 1892</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>King Cophetua</h2>
<p>The crown falls out of his indolent hand; the crown that is his beautiful
city of Arles with its high walls and ponds and square paved dams, with the
large Roman arena and a great number of black bulls, with the church of St.
Trophime and the Alyscams, with the little yellow houses at night with whores
pale as candle wax behind small windows in narrow back streets, with the street
corners and river banks attached to the intimations of his childhood, and his
favorite diseases: fever and the shivers, and the rivers, once so precious to
him, in the distance between rocky mountains under a black and yellow evening
sky, and all the statues he loved for no reason, and distant views from the
arena tower, and a dim idea of the pains of others, all that drops out of his
hand and leaves him entirely alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>König Cophetua, 1895</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Creature of the Flood<br>
Poem of the Mussels</h2>
<p>We are alone in the dark. You up there have lips, rolled-up leaves, hands
entwined with rosy blood and bluish veins, we are alone and cannot touch. We
live our life fully, our fate is to resist the waves, that is what we become,
and triumph and pain color us as the reflection of fall and of the sun colors
the waves there near the surface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Geschöpf der Flut / Gedicht der Muscheln, 1899</h6>
<h2>Creatures of Flame</h2>
<p>We are all creatures of flame. The butterfly: the intensity of a short life
and fragility become color. My death is like shadow, my life aquiver, a pulse in
the light; I am so close to death it makes me proud, cruel and demonic.</p>
<p>Unmoved, I flutter from Helen's lips to Adonis' wound. I love my death, the
flame, more than anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Geschöpfe der Flamme, 1899</h6>
<h1><a name="bottom">Notes</a></h1>
<p>These translations are based on <font color="#800000">Hugo von Hofmannsthal, <i>Gesammelte
Werke, Gedichte · Dramen I</i></font> (poems) and <font color="#800000">Hugo
von Hofmannsthal, <i>Gesammelte Werke, Erzählungen · Erfundene Gespräche und
Briefe · Reisen</i></font> (prose poems), edited by Bernd Schoeller and Rudolf
Hirsch, Frankfurt: Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag 1979.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>About the poems</h3>
<p>The poems translated here are not among Hofmannsthal's widely known poems,
such as <i>Reiselied</i>, <i>Die Beiden</i>, <i>Ballade des äußeren Lebens</i>
and <i>Vorfrühling</i>, which remain popular in the German-speaking countries,
can be found in many anthologies and made their precocious author – less than
20 years of age – famous under the pseudonym <i>Loris</i>.</p>
<p>Despite their astounding formal perfection, many of Hofmannsthal's best-known
poems appear somewhat dated mood pieces because of their fin-de-siècle preoccupation
with morbid topics. To me, they seem to be very recognizably the work of a
serious, extremely well-read youngster with a great dosis of ideals and
imagination – and the limited real experience of a <i>kid</i>.</p>
<p>I should also add that an adequate translation of Hofmannsthal's rhymed poems
into English would be a daunting task I have no desire to undertake at this point
in time. That such translations are possible is demonstrated by some excellent
English renderings of a German language poet who greatly surpasses Hofmannsthal
in fame outside the German-speaking countries – Rainer Maria Rilke. It is
interesting to note that their life spans practically coincide: Hofmannsthal
lived from 1874 to 1929, Rilke from 1875 to 1926. Rilke's early poems were
written at about the same time as Hofmannsthal's. However, Hofmannsthal quit writing poetry altogether at about the turn
of the century, turning mainly to drama, while Rilke's major poetic works all date from the time after
1900.</p>

<h3>About the prose poems</h3>
<p>All of Hofmannsthal's prose poems are from his posthumous work, i.e. they
were not published during his lifetime. The first great prose poems to appear in
German literature were Novalis' <i>Hymns to the Night</i> of 1800 (English
translation 1949). Hofmannsthal's prose poems were influenced by Baudelaire,
Rimbaud and Mallarmé, who had elevated the genre to an important art form in
the 2nd half of the 19th century, and by Turgenev's <i>Poems in Prose</i>
(1882).</p>
<p><font color="#800000">The Rose and the Desk:</font> First published in 1971.
An esthetic piece with a tinge of Hans Christian Andersen.</p>
<p><font color="#800000">King Cophetua:</font> First published in 1959. King
Cophetua was an ancient African king of great wealth who disdained women and was immune to love.
However, one day he saw a beggar girl, and, falling instantly in love with her, vowed to
make her his queen. This is told in an Elizabethan ballad by Richard Johnson, <i>A
Song of a Beggar and a King</i> (1612), and in Tennyson's poem <i>The Beggar Maid</i>
(1842). Other references to King Cophetua can be found in Shakespeare's <i>Love's
Labour's Lost</i> and <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. The story is also the subject of
the painting <i>King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid</i> (1884) by pre-raphaelite
Edward Burne-Jones. The beggar maid theme is absent in this prose poem, and I do not know what made Hofmannsthal tie this African king
in with the city of Arles in south-eastern France. The Roman arena dates to the 1st century B.C. The church of St. Trophime, named after
the saint who founded the Arles bishopric in the 1st century A.D., was founded in the
7th century. The church is the youngest building mentioned by Hofmannsthal,
which would date this poem to some time after the 7th century.</p>
<p><font color="#800000">Creature of the Flood /
Poem of the Mussels</font> and <font color="#800000">Creatures of Flame</font>:
Both were first published in 1957.</p>
