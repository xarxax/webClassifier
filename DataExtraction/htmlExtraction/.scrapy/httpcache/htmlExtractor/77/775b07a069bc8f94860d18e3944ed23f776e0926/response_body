            <p><strong>The Original Pancake House</strong> was founded in Portland, Oregon in
                1953 by Les Highet and Erma Hueneke. Drawing upon their many years of experience in the culinary field, and their extensive working
                knowledge of authentic national and ethnic pancake recipes they were able to offer without compromise this unique and original menu
                which has gained national acclaim. The Original Pancake House is a second and third generation family business, which takes great
                pride in maintaining the high standards that make our food so outstanding. We now have over one hundred franchises from coast to
                coast, which have won local and national acclaim. Our recipes demand only the very finest of ingredients, such as 93 score butter,
                pure 36% whipping cream, fresh grade AA eggs, hard wheat unbleached flour, and our own recipe sourdough starter. Our batters and
                sauces are made fresh in each restaurant&rsquo;s kitchen.</p>

            <p>Our signature items include the Apple Pancake, a single large pancake smothered with sautéed apples and cinnamon sugar baked to perfection, to create a deliciously rich cinnamon sugar glaze.</p>

            <p>Another signature item is the Dutch Baby, an air filled delight oven baked to golden perfection and served with lemon, whipped butter
                and powdered sugar to create a mouthwatering blend.</p>

            <p>Our unique omelets, including the mushroom omelet topped with homemade rich mushroom sherry sauce, are rolled in a skillet and then
                oven baked to give you a splendidly light, moist delicacy. Our gourmet crepes include the cherry kijafa crepe, a blend of tart
                cherries and sweet Danish cherry wine. Our continental crepe is rolled with sour cream tempered with orange liqueur and served with
                our famous tropical syrup, made from a delectable blend of citrus fruits. We often feature the finest fresh fruits of the season. Our
                signature coffee is specially blended, roasted and ground for The Original Pancake House to complement your meal.</p>

            <p>It is our constant objective to serve you the finest pancakes available, and to give you pleasant and courteous service. Our menu items
