    <p>Society in Chaucer's England was divided into 'orders': those who
      fight, those who labor and those who pray, the nobles, the
      peasants and the clergy. <br>

      England&nbsp; was ruled by kings and lords, the most powerful of
      whom were known as 'barons' with huge lands and almost royal
      power. Most people were 'commoners' who lived in villages and
      worked land that belonged to lords and 'gentlemen' (noblemen).
      Gentlemen (gentry) and higher aristocrats were 'noble' while the
      rest were 'commoners' although 'yeomen' commoners might also own
      land. Land was seen as the main form of wealth, but the 'farmers'
      (peasants) working the land usually paid rent in kind
      (agricultural products) so that the land-owning lords often had
      little ready money. Peasnats were also allowed to work 'common
      land' where they pastured their own animals and planted their own
      crops without having to pay rent. <br>

    <p>The towns and cities were inhabited by free citizens, a mixture
      of merchants and poorer working people, with a town council
      presided by an annually chosen mayor with no special powers. Many
      merchants were the younger sons of landowners who wanted to earn a
      living. There was no professional army; aristocrats might practice
      martial skills and would be required to raise and lead a troop of
      soldiers from among their male tenants if the king and Parliament
      decided to fight a war. The sons of noblemen were termed squires
      and they might either prepare to become mounted soldiers
      ('knights') or courtiers (administrators), or both.<br>

    <p>The royal court was the seat of real power, and of sophisticated
      culture. The king was required to consult his 'Privy Council" on
      most decisions. Parliament was already divided into two 'houses':
      Lords and Commons. The higher lords who were eldest sons
      automatically became members of the House of Lords when their
      fathers died. The church's Bishops were also members of the House
      of Lords. The members of the House of Commons were elected by the
      richer (house-owning / land-owning) citizens in boroughs across
      the country each year. Originally Parliament was an advisory body
      but by Chaucer's time it was agreed that a king could not make new
      laws, raise an army or levy taxes without Parliament's consent,
      since the Commons represented the people with money who would have
      to pay taxes and keep the laws. Chaucer became a Member of
      Parliament briefly.<br>

    <p>The Church owned much land. The country was divided into dioceses
      ruled by bishops, there being 2 archbishops in Canterbury and
      York. Each diocese was divided into small parishes with a rector
      in charge and other priests helping. The people had to pay
      'tithes' to the parish to support the priests. There was only one
      Church, the Catholic Church, although each national church was
      fairly independent and bishops were often appointed by the king
      rather than the Pope in Rome. In addition, there were many
      monasteries, away from the towns, with land, tenant peasants to
      work the land, while the monks prayed and studied. From the 13th
      century there were also many groups of Friars belonging to new
      groups founded by St Francis, St Dominic, etc who lived in the
      towns, ran their own churches, 'begged' for money from the
      ordinary people and competed with the ordinary priests. Priests
      belonged to the 'clergy'; the 'clerk' was someone who had learned
      to read and write, and had studied, but many clerks did not become
      priests, instead they went to work as secretaries in the houses of
      powerful lords. In England there were only two 'schools'
      (universities), at Oxford and Cambridge; young lords and other
      wishing to learn about law studied at the 'Inns of Court' in
      London. Chaucer seems to have learned to read and write as a page
      serving in the royal palaces, without any formal education.<br>

    <p>Chaucer is mentioned no less than 493 times in contemporary
      documents, mostly lists of money paid out to people serving the
      king or other powerful figures. Through them we know many details
      about his career in royal and government service. The literary
      works played no apparent part in this public career and there is
      no indication in the court or public records of his writing
      activities. Yet there is no serious doubt that in the course of
      his busy working life, Geoffrey Chaucer found time to translate
      and write the various works that make him the first recognizable
      named "author" of England. The many documentary records mean that
      we can follow his life in far greater detail than, for example,
      that of Shakespeare. They establish the context in which he moved,
      although they shed little or no direct light on the works he
      wrote. </p>
    <p>Chaucer's father, John Chaucer, occasionally held positions in
      the royal administration, but he was first and foremost a
      wine-merchant in London, an important member of the business
      (merchant) community. Geoffrey Chaucer's mother's name was Alice.
      Geoffrey, probably their only son, was born some time around 1340.
      In 1386 he is noted in a legal record as being '<i>del age de xl
        ans et plus, armeez par xxvii ans</i>' (of the age of forty
      years and more, bearing arms for twenty-seven years) and the years
      1342-3 are popularly accepted as being the most probable years for
      his birth. </p>
    <p>In 1348-9 Chaucer and his parents were fortunate to escape
      infection during the <b>Black Death</b>. The history of this
      pandemic begins with the arrival from the Middle East of a boat
      full of dying sailors in Sicily in October 1347. The plague,
      spread mainly by the fleas carried by infected rats, arrived in
      coastal towns of England in June 1348, and reached London early in
      1349. <br>

      Within eight months, some 2 million of England's 5 million
      inhabitants were dead. Some villages lost all their inhabitants,
      in many places more than half died, yet remarkably enough the
      normal functioning of society was not seriously interrupted. After
      this, there were regular outbreaks of the plague during Chaucer's
      lifetime and for centuries after, until the last Great Plague
      ravaged London in 1665. Most of Alice Chaucer's family died in the
      Black Death. </p>
    <p>Records from 1357 show that Geoffrey Chaucer was already serving
      as a page in the household of the young <b>Prince Lionel</b>,
      later Earl of Ulster and Duke of Clarence (1338-68), one of the
      sons of king Edward III. In 1359 Chaucer was given the right to
      bear arms and fight for the king and his social title would then
      have been valettus or yeoman. He went to France that year in a
      small company led by Prince Lionel. There he was taken prisoner
      and had to be ransomed early in 1360. He returned to France
      briefly later the same year. After this there is no record
      mentioning him for several years, except a possible indication of
      a visit to Spain in 1366. Prince Lionel was in Ireland during
      these years but Chaucer may well have gone into the king's service
      instead of following him there. </p>
    <p>By 1366 he had married <b>Philippa de Roet</b>, a maid to Edward
      III's Queen Philippa. Katherine de Roet, Chaucer's sister- in-law,
      was for many years the mistress, later the third wife, of the
      powerful magnate <span style="font-weight: bold;">John of Gaunt</span>
      (1340-99), another son of King Edward. Records show that by 1367
      Chaucer was serving the king as a Valet, but now with the social
      rank of esquire. He was never knighted. </p>
    <p>We have no indication of when Chaucer began to write but it seems
      likely that among his first experiments was an attempt to
      translate a few parts of the 13th-century French love-allegory <b><i>le
          Roman de la Rose</i></b> (The Romance of the Rose). All that
      exists of this translation are a few fragments, and not all those
      are certainly by Chaucer, but certainly the work itself exercised
      a profound influence on him. Oddly enough, Chaucer almost never
      uses the allegorical personifications that characterize the <i>Romance

        of the Rose</i> in his own writing. His first work seems to have
      been <b><i>The Book of the Duchess</i></b>, provoked by the death
      of John of Gaunt's wife Blanche, in 1368.<br>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><img style=" width: 225px; height:
        350px;" alt="" src="Rose.jpg"><br>
    </p>
    <p>The royal accounts give an interesting glimpse of the ways
      Chaucer was paid for his services. For example, in 1368 he was
      given a license to travel from Dover to France with two horses.
      With that he received twenty shillings in English money for his
      expenses as well as ten pounds in foreign exchange. In 1374 the
      king awarded him one pitcher (about five liters) of wine each day
      for life; a few years later he was able to have this changed to a
      regular money payment. In 1377 he received forty shillings for
      winter and summer robes. Later he received regular annuities, but
      the monthly salaries normal today were unknown in his time. </p>
    <p>He made a number of journeys abroad. It is possible, but very
      unlikely, that he attended the marriage of Prince Lionel in Milan
      in 1368. Poor Prince Lionel died while still in Italy, only a few
      months after his wedding. Certainly Chaucer was in <b>Italy</b> a
      few years later. records show that in 1372-3 he went to Genoa and
      then on to Florence on official business. Chaucer may well have
      learned Italian before this, from Italian merchants doing business
      with his father in his childhood. </p>
    <p>The Italy he visited was not a nation-state but a patchwork of
      often very sophisticated city-states, each with its own ruler. It
      was a place of intense cultural activity. The great painter <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Giotto</span> had already finished
      his work and died forty years before, not long after Dante; the
      first great steps in renaissance humanism had already been taken;
      poetry was immensely valued in society. When Chaucer arrived for
      his first visit, <b>Petrarch </b>(1304-74) was just completing
      the final version of his <i>Canzoniere</i>, <b>Boccaccio </b>(1313-

      75) too was still active. Both were by then very famous old men
      and it is not at all likely that Chaucer could have met either of
      them. There were some great libraries in Italy but we do not know
      if he would have been allowed to view them. He was only a rather
      junior foreign envoy, after all. </p>
    <p>Chaucer stayed some three months in Italy, but we have no
      information on his activities. Florence was the centre of the cult
      of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dante</span> (1265-1321) and
      a year later a series of lectures on Dante was given there by
      Boccaccio. Probably it was on this first visit that Chaucer
      obtained a copy of Dante's works.<br>

    <p>In 1374 Chaucer was made controller of wool customs in London, a
      difficult and time-consuming job, which meant he no longer had to
      be present regularly at court. He may have realized that political
      tensions were brewing between court and Parliament and wanted to
      find a quiet job away from trouble. In the same year he received
      the right to live rent-free in accommodation on top of the city
      gate known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Aldgate</span>.<br>

    </p>
    <p>It seems likely that it was in or after 1374 that he composed <b><i>The
House

          of Fame</i></b>, which shows strong influence from Dante but
      owes nothing to Boccaccio, of whose works Chaucer seems only to
      have learned on his second visit to Italy. This odd work is
      preserved, like the<i> Book of the Duchess</i>, in only a few
      copies; clearly Chaucer had not yet become a popular writer. The
      dating is made possible by references to his customs work in lines
      652-5. </p>
    <p>King Edward III died in 1377, less than a year after the death of
      his eldest son, Edward the Black Prince. The Black Prince's son
      became <b>King Richard II</b> at the age of ten. In 1378 Chaucer
      again went on royal service to <b>France and to northern Italy</b>,
      as the junior member of an embassy to Bernabo Visconti, the Lord
      of Milan whom he later introduced into the Monk's Tale's list of
      great falls. Visconti was murdered in 1385.<br>

    <p>He almost certainly brought back from this visit copies of
      Boccaccio's <i>Filostrato</i>, <i>Teseida</i>, and probably
      other works. Chaucer uses the <i>Teseida</i> in the fragment <i>Anelida

        and Arcite</i>, <i>The Parliament of Fowls</i>, <i>Troilus and
        Criseyde</i>, as well as the <i>Knight's Tal</i>e. The <i>Filostrato

      </i>is the basis for <i>Troilus</i>. The two youthful works by
      Boccaccio were particularly congenial to Chaucer, who obviously
      felt a deep affinity with the way they were composed, and adapted
      them in remarkably free and creative ways. It is not possible to
      decide whether Chaucer knew the <i>Decameron</i> directly,
      although its use of a framing device is thought to have inspired
      the structure of the<i> Canterbury Tales</i>. </p>
    <p>Perhaps soon after his return from Italy, he wrote <b><i>The
          Parliament of Fowls</i></b>. This work is preserved in
      fourteen manuscripts, and many more have been lost; it was
      obviously far more widely known than the previous two works. Like
      them, it too is in the popular form of a dream-vision, inspired by
      a widely- read Latin classic, Cicero's <i>Dream of Scipio</i>
      from the commentary of Macrobius. This is precisely the book that
      Chaucer picks up at the start of the poem, before falling asleep
      and beginning to dream. </p>
    <p>In 1381, London was the main focus of the so-called '<b>Peasants'
        Revolt</b>'. This complex event was the climax of a number of
      different social processes and not all the people involved were
      peasants. It certainly reflected a widespread wish for freedom
      from older kinds of administrative control. Since so many
      villagers had died in the Black Death, labourers' wages had risen
      and the Parliament had several times tried to make laws reducing
      farm workers' wages. The imposition of new taxes, a poll tax in
      particular, in 1377, 1379, and 1380, increased resentment to
      breaking point. In London too, there were many discontented
      people. </p>
    <p>In June 1381, the rebels from Kent reached London, claiming they
      wanted to obtain justice from the young king Richard II, whom they
      idolized. They plundered the city, burning John of Gaunt's Savoy
      Palace in revenge for his role in making the new taxes. They
      dragged a group of Flemish immigrants from a church and massacred
      them for taking work from Londoners. Finally, they entered the
      Tower of London and murdered the Archbishop of Canterbury. </p>
    <p>King Richard agreed to meet the rebels' leaders at Smithfield and
      showed himself understanding. Then, while they were talking, the
      mayor of London suddenly struck down <b>Wat Tyler</b>, the main
      leader of the revolt, and in the confusion the other main figures
      were arrested. Many were later executed. There is no indication
      that Chaucer played any role in these events, although he does
      mention the leader from Essex, <b>Jack Straw</b>, in the <i>Nun's
        Priest's Tale</i>. Some of the rebels were idealists motivated
      by a kind of religious egalitarianism and quoting from an early
      version of<span style="font-style: italic;"> Piers Plowman</span>,
      but Chaucer probably saw them as a lawless rabble.<br>

    </p>
    <p>Almost certainly, Chaucer began to work on adapting the works by
      Boccaccio he had brought back from Italy soon after his return.
      Later, in 1386-7, he began to write <b><i>The Legend of Good
          Women</i></b> and in the <i>Prologue</i> to that unfinished
      work, Alceste defends Chaucer against the reproaches of the god of
      Love who is angry that he translated the <i>Roman de la Rose</i>
      and wrote <i>Troilus</i>, two works that give a negative picture
      of women (later parts of the<i> Roman</i> are fiercely
      anti-feminist). Alceste replies that Chaucer has written other
      works that encourage people to serve and praise Love. She names
      the <i>House of Fame</i>, 'the <i>Deeth of Blaunche the Duchesse</i>',
      the <i>Parliament of Fowls</i>, and a work she calls <i>The Love
        of Palamon and Arcite</i>. It is generally assumed that this
      last work is the adaptation of the <i>Teseida</i> that we know as
      the <i>Knight's Tale</i> in the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>.It would
      seem that Chaucer wrote that before or at the same time as he
      began work on <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i>, but did not distribute
      it before making it part of the Tales. </p>
    <p><b><i>Troilus and Criseyde</i></b> was written during the years
      1381-6 and was the first of Chaucer's works to be widely admired.
      It and the Knight's Tale are both deeply marked by the influence
      of Boethius's <b><i>Consolation
          of Philosophy </i></b>which he was perhaps translating at the
      time. Alceste, in her defence of Chaucer, later mentions that he
      translated <i>Boece</i>, the standard medieval name for Boethius.
      Chaucer mentions the work with some pride in the 'Retracciouns' at
      the end of the <i>Parson's Tale</i>. His translation is entirely
      in prose, following the model of Jean de Meun's French version
      which he used. In view of the strong Boethian influence on <i>Troilus</i>
      and the <i>Knight's Tale</i>, it seems fair to assume that
      Chaucer was translating Boethius at the same time as he was
      writing them. Perhaps he also wrote the short poems on Boethian
      themes at this time: <b><i>The Former Age, Fortune, Truth,
          Gentilesse, </i></b>and <b><i>Lak of Stedfastnesse.<br>
        </i></b></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><b><i><img style=" width: 384px;

        </i></b> </p>
    <p>Thus, during the 1380s, Chaucer became widely known among the
      literary circles of London, and around him we find a few quite
      powerful men who seem to have constituted a '<b>Chaucer Circle</b>':
      Sir Lewis Clifford (friend of the French poets Deschamps and Oton
      de Granson), Sir Richard Stury (friend of the French chronicler
      Froissart); Sir John Montagu (admired as a poet by the great
      French poet Christine de Pisan); and John Clanvowe, who later
      wrote the first 'Chaucerian' poem The Book of Cupid. To these
      should be added Henry Scogan, Thomas Hoccleve, Thomas Usk, John
      Gower, and Ralph Strode.<br>

    <p>At the same time, Chaucer was active in society. In 1386 he was
      elected as Member of Parliament for Kent and at the end of the
      year he resigned from the position as controller of the wool
      custom. In 1385 he had become a member of the commission of the
      peace for Kent, the board of magistrates responsible for judging
      people charged with small offences at sessions held a few times
      each year. Chaucer seems to have left London at this time and gone
      to live in Kent. He may have realized that trouble was coming. In
      1386-9 there was a fierce campaign by Parliament against
      corruption in the royal household, culminating in the '<span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Merciless Parliament</span>' of 1388,
      when a number of people in positions similar to Chaucer's were
      executed.<br>

      By refusing to take sides and by knowing when to withdraw, Chaucer
      survived with reputation intact. He became clerk of the king's
      works in July 1389, only a few months after King Richard had taken
      over the running of national business for himself. This was a very
      challenging position. He had to oversee building and repairs on
      the properties belonging to the king, paying wages, obtaining
      materials, recruiting workmen. During Chaucer's time in office,
      Henry Yevele was building <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
        nave of Westminster Abbey.</span>&nbsp; The main work overseen
      by Chaucer was the construction of a new wharf at the Tower of
      London, as well as the new roof of <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">Westminster Hall</span>. He also had to oversee the
      building of 'lists' for a royal tournament at Smithfield in 1390.
      These humble wooden lists must have contrasted sharply in his mind
      with the magnificent constructions he had described in such detail
      in the <i>Knight's Tale</i>. He lost his job rather suddenly in
      1391. 1391 is also the year used as a model in his <span
        style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Treatise on the
        Astrolabe</span>, which seems to have been written at this time
      for his son or god-son.<br>

    <p>Chaucer probably went on living in Kent during this time. This
      was not necessarily far from London. There is some possibility
      that his home was in Greenwich, only a few miles down the Thames
      from London Bridge. These were now the years in which he did most
      of the work on the <b><i>Canterbury Tales</i></b>, still far from
      complete at his death. A considerable number of the separate Tales
      were undoubtedly completed before this, of course. The tale of
      Saint Cecilia, the story of Melibee, the tragedies told in the <i>Monk's
        Tale</i>, perhaps even the treatise on sin given to the Parson,
      must date from earlier stages in Chaucer's career.<br>

    <p>The records seem to show Chaucer having problems with small debts
      during the 1390s. His income was irregular, but there are several
      records of new grants and some generous gifts, including an annual
      barrel of wine from the king in 1397. At some point he seems to
      have been named deputy forester for the forest of North Petherton
      in Somerset. He moved back into London in 1398, and took a lease
      on a house in Westminster in late 1399. </p>
    <p>He was therefore well placed to experience the dramatic events of
      Richard's downfall. Richard had been trying to secure peace with
      France, and this did not please some of the most powerful lords,
      including his uncle the Earl of Gloucester, the youngest son of
      Edward III, the Earl of Arundel, and the Earl of Northumberland,
      who had public opinion on their side. In 1396, in a peace-making
      move, Richard married Isabella, the daughter of the king of
      France, to replace his first queen, Anne, who died in 1394. </p>
    <p>In 1397 Richard had Gloucester and others arrested. Gloucester
      was sent to France, where he was secretly murdered by Mowbray
      (Duke of Nottingham). Others too were exiled or executed. In
      January 1398 Richard made Parliament grant him an income for life,
      and forced various counties to pay him large sums in fines and
      loans. It seemed to some that the king wanted to be tyrant of
      England and to this end he appointed a Council where no one would
      oppose him. He surrounded himself with favourites and lived in
      greater luxury than any English king had ever known before.
      Richard was a great patron of the arts. When Mowbray and John of
      Gaunt's son the duke of Hereford (Henry Bolingbroke) accused each
      other of treason (both knew about the murder of Gloucester),
      Richard organized a formal trial by combat in September 1398. As
      they prepared to fight according to the rules of chivalry
      governing disputes between peers, Richard abruptly stopped the
      proceedings and exiled them both. In February 1399 John of Gaunt
      died. In March Richard confiscated all Gaunt's properties that he
      had earlier promised Bolingbroke should inherit normally,
      declaring him banished for ever. Richard then left for a campaign
      in Ireland; he had no adviser who dared to tell him he was acting
      very foolishly. In late June Bolingbroke landed in the north of
      England and many of the powerful lords joined with him. At first
      he claimed to have come only for his lawful inheritance. The king
      returned from Ireland to find that he had no army left and was
      obliged to trust the promises made by the Earl of Northumberland.
      After being arrested, on September 30 Richard abdicated, and on
      October 13 Bolingbroke was crowned <b>King Henry IV</b>. Richard
      was murdered in prison early in 1400.<br>

    <p>Henry IV quite quickly confirmed Chaucer in his positions and
      regular income but no money appeared, and he needed money for his
      new house in the garden at the east end of Westminster Abbey. He
      therefore sent the new king a poem, <b><i>The Complaint to his
          Purse</i></b>, which he may have written before. Whether
      because of it or not, he was paid soon after but did not collect
      the payment himself. Perhaps he was sick? Chaucer is traditionally
      said to have died on 25 October 1400 and was buried in the south
      transept of Westminster Abbey. A monument to him was erected
      during the reign of Mary Tudor in 1556, starting the tradition of
      "Poet's Corner." </p>
    <p> </p>
    <hr width="100%">
    <p>Chaucer was not, then, a professional writer but a courtier and a
      civil servant. It is not possible to know what was the
      relationship between his writing and his public life. Perhaps at
      first it offered him ways to make himself noticed by the powerful
      people on whom he depended for work and income? Or was it mainly a
      private compulsion, yielding works shared with only a few
      like-minded friends? </p>
    <p>Probably only five percent of the people in Chaucer's England
      could read at all, and many of them had no chance to read literary
      works. It seems to have been the practice, even at the court, for
      one person to read aloud from a manuscript book to a listening
      audience; there is a painting in one manuscript of Chaucer doing
      this himself, before the gathered court, but this scene is not a
      realistic portrayal. One vital characteristic of Chaucer's art is
      the way it plays with the contrasts between oral story-telling and
      written literature.<br>

        works</font> </p>
    <p>Chaucer's earliest works may be termed "occasional poetry", if we
      accept that the<b><i> Book of the Duchess</i></b> was written to
      console John of Gaunt on the death of his wife Blanche in 1369,
      and if the <b><i>Parliament
          of Fowls</i></b> was written to mark the marriage of Richard
      II in 1382. But nobody has found an occasion to explain the
      writing of the <b><i>House
          of Fame</i></b>, and none of these three works corresponds to
      a conventional kind of occasional poem. </p>
    <p>In the <b><i>Book of the Duchess</i></b> (1334 octosyllabic
      lines), the love-sick narrator falls asleep as he reads the sad
      love story (from Ovid) of Ceix and Alcyone, and dreams he is in
      bed early in the morning, then out hunting. He follows a dog down
      a path, where he finds a knight dressed in black lamenting the
      loss of his lady; the narrator forces the knight to tell how good
      and beautiful she was, and at last obliges him to admit that she
      is dead. The other hunters reappear, a bell strikes, and the
      dreamer awakes with his book still in his hand. </p>
    <p>The <b><i>Parliament of Fowls</i></b> (699 lines in rhyme-royal,
      seven- line stanzas rhyming ababbcc) begins with the narrator
      reading the <i>Somnium Scipionis</i> and reflecting on the nature
      of love; he falls asleep and the protagonist of Cicero's book,
      Africanus, leads him into a garden which is an illustration of the
      themes of the book. They reach the temple of Venus, which is full
      of emblems of the power and sorrows of love; finally, in a garden
      similar to that of the <i>Romance of the Rose</i>, the birds are
      gathered before the goddess Nature for a debate about the problem
      of a female eagle loved by three males. Lower class birds offer
      un-poetic, practical solutions to this impossible problem, and the
      debate is adjourned for a year so that the female can reflect
      quietly. The noise the birds make as they disperse wakens the
      narrator, who picks up other books in search of something he
      cannot find. </p>
    <p>The <b><i>House of Fame </i></b>(2158 octosyllabic lines)
      consists of three books, and is incomplete. There is a Prologue on
      dreams and an invocation to Sleep; Book I tells of the dreamer's
      visit to the Temple of Glass where he finds images suggested by
      Book IV and other parts of Virgil's Aeneid. In Book II he is
      seized by a talkative eagle and carried up into the House of Fame
      in the heavens where he sees, during his visit in Book III, images
      of famous writers; in particular he sees how arbitrary Fame is.
      Beside the House of Fame he sees the Labyrinth, representing the
      confused complexity of human existence, with all kinds of false
      tidings carried by shipmen and pilgrims. An un-named figure "of
      great authority" appears and the poems stops short. </p>
    <p>To these three works should be added two other titles: <i>Anelida

        and Arcite</i>, a strange fragment of a love story, and the
      incomplete<i> <b>Legend of Good Women</b></i>. The <i>Legend</i>
      begins with a Prologue which exists in two versions, then uses the
      decasyllabic couplets so familiar freom the Canterbury Tales to
      tell nine stories of famous women: Cleopatra, Thisbe, Dido,
      Hypsipyle and Medea, Lucrece, Ariadne, Philomela, Phyllis, and
      Hypermnestra. </p>
    <p>The <i>Legend of Good Women</i>, of which twelve manuscripts
      survive, breaks off in mid-sentence and there has been much debate
      as to whether Chaucer wrote more. In the 'Retracciouns' he calls
      it 'the book of the XXV. Ladies' and this same title was used by
      someone writing between 1406 and 1413. In the Introduction to his
      Tale, the Man of Law, praising Chaucer, refers to is as a 'large
      volume' and lists sixteen heroines although his list omits some
      whose tales survive. It seems better to think that by some
      accident much of the work was lost before it could be copied,
      perhaps just after Chaucer's death. </p>
    <p>The first version of the Prologue suggests that Chaucer wanted to
      dedicate the work to Queen Anne. Since it refers to Troilus, it
      must have been written after about 1385-6. If the second version
      of the Prologue is indeed a revision of the first, the fact that
      references to Queen Anne have been removed suggests that the
      revision was done after her death in June 1394. It would be wrong
      to assume that the Queen really instructed Chaucer to write the
      work, or to take too seriously the Prologue's claim that it is a
      'penance' for having written stories hostile to women. This
      literary device imitates one first used by the French poet
      Machaut. </p>
    <p>The Legend has a bad critical reputation but today it is
      recognized as the work in which Chaucer finally honed his
      narratorial skills before embarking on the <i>General Prologue</i>
      and the compilation of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, many parts of
      which were already complete as isolated works or translations. The
      dominant concern in the Legend is to challenge and recompose by
      inversion the conventions governing the literary representation of
      women and gender roles. </p>
    <p>It used to be claimed that Chaucer stopped writing it because he
      was bored by the repetition of silly stories about virtuous women
      and wanted to get on with the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, only the
      Queen would not let him. This is not perhaps a very helpful
      approach. Chaucer was clearly fascinated by the questions he was
      dealing with and they continue in the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. </p>
    <p>The most important themes of all these works are love, nature,
      and the ways the literary imagination produces books about love
      and nature. They are all of them (except for the <i>Anelida</i>)
      in the form of dream-visions, and all of them play subtle games
      with literary references, many of them veiled or obscure. In
      particular, the way in which the<i> House of Fame</i> keeps
      echoing Dante is intriguing, for it is not sure who in England at
      this time could read or had even heard of Dante, except perhaps a
      few friends to whom Chaucer had spoken of him. </p>
    <p>It is certain that Chaucer was an intense reader with a great
      interest in thoughtful writing; in the <i>House of Fame</i>
      (lines 652-7) the eagle scolds him: </p>
    <p>For when thy labour doon al ys, <br>
      And hast mad alle thy rekenynges, <br>
      In stede of reste and newe thynges, <br>
      Thou goost hom to thy hous anoon; <br>
      And also domb as any stoon, <br>
      Thou sittest at another book </p>
    <p>and in the prologues to the<i> Legend of Good Women</i> he admits
      that "On bokes for to rede I me delyte/ And to hem yive I feyth
      and ful credence." </p>

    <p><a name="Troilus and Criseyde"></a><i><font size="+2">Troilus and
          Criseyde</font></i> </p>
    <p><i>Troilus and Criseyde</i> is a work on another scale
      altogether, 8239 lines of rhyme-royal (seven-line stanzas rhyming
      ababbcc) in five books, the first major work of English literature
      and sometimes called the first English novel on account of its
      concern with the characters' psychology. </p>
    <p>The story comes from Boccaccio's <i>Il Filostrato</i>, and it is
      most intriguing that Chaucer nowhere mentions the name Boccaccio.
      Instead, in <i>Troilus</i>, he claims to be simply translating a
      work by a certain Lollius, wrongly assumed in the Middle Ages to
      have written about Troy, whereas he is in fact radically altering
      Boccaccio's story to make it deeper and more poetic. </p>
    <p>When he began to write <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i>, Chaucer was
      already fully aware of the need to make the English language into
      a poetic diction that would be as powerful in expressing emotion
      and reflexion as the other literary languages he knew. He was
      familiar with the writings of Ovid, Cicero, Virgil, Macrobius,
      Boethius, and Alain de Lisle in Latin, with Dante, Petrarch,
      Boccaccio in Italian, with the <i>Romance of the Rose</i> and
      other French works, as well as with the native English romances.
      He had travelled, too, his mind was European. The opening lines of
      <i>Troilus
        and Criseyde </i>show why John Dryden called Chaucer the
      "father of English poetry" (in the Preface to his <i>Fables
        Ancient and Modern</i> of 1700): </p>
    <ul>
      The double sorwe of Troilus to tellen, <br>
      That was the king Priamus sone of Troye, <br>
      In lovinge, how his aventures fellen <br>
      Fro woe to wele, and after out of joie, <br>
      My purpos is, er that I parte fro ye. <br>

      <p>To thee clepe I, thou goddess of torment, <br>
        Thou cruel Furie, sorwing ever in peyne, <br>
        Help me, that am the sorwful instrument, <br>
        That helpeth loveres, as I can, to pleyne. <br>
        For wel sit it, the sothe for to seyne, <br>
        A woful wight to han a drery feere, <br>
        And to a sorwful tale, a sory chere.</p>
    </ul>
    Chaucer was following in the footsteps of Dante in his attempt to
    form vernacular English into a poetic language able to stand beside
    the language of Virgil and the classics.
    <p><i>Troilus and Criseyde</i> is set inside Troy during the Trojan
      War. In Book 1 of Chaucer's version, one of Priam's sons, Troilus,
      appears as a young warrior scornful of love, until he glimpses
      Criseyde in a temple. Love's arrow having wounded him, Troilus
      suddenly finds himself deeply in love with her. He withdraws to
      complain alone, but a friend of his, Pandare, overhears him and he
      admits he is in love with Criseyde. Pandare offers to help Troilus
      meet her. </p>
    <p>Much time elapses as they slowly establish a relationship, until
      at last Pandare skillfully arranges for them to spend a night
      together. This represents the first movement, 'from woe to wele' a
      rise to happiness. Suddenly Criseyde learns that her father, a
      prophet who has fled to the Greeks, is arranging for her to leave
      Troy and join him. The lovers are separated by blind destiny. Once
      in the Greek camp, Criseyde soon turns for protection to a Greek
      Diomede and although she and Troilus exchange letters, soon she
      seems to forget him. One day Troilus finds a brooch he gave her
      fixed in a cloak he has torn from Diomede during the fighting, and
      knows that she has betrayed him. He tries to kill Diomede, but
      cannot. Suddenly the book seems to be over, since the love-tale is
      at an end: </p>
    <ul>
      Go, little book, go, little myn tragedye, <br>
      Ther God thy makere yet, er that he dye, <br>
      So sende might to make in some comedye! <br>
      But little book, no making thou n'envie, <br>
      But subgit be to alle poesye; <br>
      And kiss the steppes, whereas thou seest pace <br>
      Virgile, Ovide, Omer, Lucan, Stace.
      <p>And down from thennes faste he gan avyse <br>
        This littel spot of erthe, that with the se <br>
        Embraced is, and fully gan despise <br>
        This wrecched world, and held al vanite <br>
        To respect of the pleyn felicite <br>
        That is in hevene above; and at the laste, <br>
        There he was slayn, his lokyng down he caste. </p>
      <p>And in hymself he lough right at the wo <br>
        Of hem that wepten for his deth so faste; <br>
        And dampned al oure werk that foloweth so <br>
        The blynde lust, the which that may not laste,M <br>

        And forth he wente, shortly for to telle, <br>
        Ther as Mercurye sorted hym to dwelle.</p>
    </ul>
    The remaining stanzas seem to suggest Christian and moralizing
    readings of the story at odds with the main narratorial tone.
    Finally comes an invitation to "moral Gower, philosophical Strode"
    (Chaucer's friends) to correct the work if necessary, and a final
    prayer translated from Dante's <i>Divine Comedy.</i>

    <p><a name="The Canterbury Tales"></a><font size="+2">The Canterbury
        Tales</font> </p>
    <p>By far Chaucer's most popular work, although he might have
      preferred to have been remembered by <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i>,
      the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> was unfinished at his death. No less
      than fifty-six surviving manuscripts contain, or once contained,
      the full text. More than twenty others contain some parts or an
      individual tale. </p>
    <p>The work begins with a <i>General Prologue</i> in which the
      narrator arrives at the Tabard Inn in Southwark, and meets other
      pilgrims there, whom he describes. In the second part of the <i>General
        Prologue</i> the inn-keeper proposes that each of the pilgrims
      tell stories along the road to Canterbury, two each on the way
      there, two more on the return journey, and that the best story
      earn the winner a free supper. </p>
    <p>Since there are some thirty pilgrims, this would have given a
      collection of well over a hundred tales, but in fact there are
      only twenty-four tales, and some of these are incomplete. Between
      tales, and at times even during a tale, the pilgrimage framework
      is introduced with some kind of exchange, often acrimonious,
      between pilgrims. In a number of cases, there is a longer Prologue
      before a tale begins, the <i>Wife of Bath's Prologue </i>and the
      <i>Pardoner's Prologue</i> being the most remarkable examples of
      this. </p>
    <p>At Chaucer's death, the various sections of the<i> Canterbury
        Tales </i>that he was preparing had not been brought together
      in a linked whole. His friends seem to have tried as best they
      could to prepare a coherent edition of what was there, adding some
      more linkages when they thought it necessary. The resulting
      manuscripts therefore offer slight differences in the order of
      tales, and in some of the framework links. The tales are usually
      found in linked groups known as 'Fragments'. The customary
      grouping and ordering of the tales is as follows (the commonly
      accepted abbreviation for each Tale is noted in parentheses): </p>
    <p><b>Fragment I (A)</b> <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; General Prologue (GP), Knight (KnT), Miller (MilT),
      Reeve (RvT), Cook (CkT). <br>
      <b>Fragment II (B1)</b> <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Man of Law (MLT) <br>
      <b>Fragment III (D)</b> <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Wife of Bath (WBT), Friar (FrT), Summoner (SumT). <br>
      <b>Fragment IV (E)</b> <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Clerk (ClT), Merchant (MerT). <br>
      <b>Fragment V (F)</b> <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Squire (SqT), Franklin (FranT). <br>
      <b>Fragment VI (C)</b> <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Physician (PhyT), Pardoner (PardT). <br>
      <b>Fragment VII (B2)</b> <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Shipman (ShipT), Prioress (PrT), Chaucer: Sir Thopas
      (Thop), Melibee (Mel), Monk (MkT), Nun's Priest (NPT). <br>
      <b>Fragment VIII (G)</b> <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Second Nun SNT), Canon's Yeoman (CYT). <br>
      <b>Fragment IX (H)</b> <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Manciple (MancT). <br>
      <b>Fragment X (I)</b> <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Parson (ParsT). </p>
    <p>There is great variety in different manuscripts but I and II, VI
      and VII, IX and X are almost always found in that order while the
      tales in IV and V are often spread around separately. </p>
    <p>Modern editions are usually based on one of two manuscripts, both
      written by the same scribe: the <b>Hengwrt Manuscript</b> and the
      <b>Ellesmere Manuscript.</b> The former, in the National Library
      of Wales, is the oldest of all, probably copied directly from
      Chaucer's own disordered papers, but it lacks the <i>Canon's
        Yeoman's Tale </i>and the final pages have been lost. The
      latter, now preserved in California, is more complete, and
      beautifully produced with illustrations of the different pilgrims
      beside their Tales, but it shows the work of an editor who has
      removed some of the roughness from Chaucer's lines. </p>
    <p>Chaucer offers in the Tales a great variety of literary forms,
      narratives of different kinds as well as other texts. The
      pilgrimage framework enriches each tale by setting it in
      relationship with others, but it would be a mistake to identify
      the narratorial voice of each tale too strongly with the
      individual pilgrim who is supposed to be telling it. </p>
    <p>After th<i>e General Prologue</i>, the Tales follow. The
      following is a brief outline of the different tales in the order
      found in the Riverside Chaucer, the standard edition. </p>
    <p><a name="Fragment I"></a><b>Fragment I</b> </p>
    <p>The work begins with a <b><i>General Prologue</i></b> in which
      the narrator (Chaucer?) arrives at the Tabard Inn in Southwark to
      set out on a pilgrimage to the shrine of St Thomas Becket at
      Canterbury, and meets other pilgrims there, whom he describes. In
      the second part of the <i>General Prologue</i> the inn-keeper
      proposes that each of the pilgrims tell stories along the road to
      Canterbury, two each on the way there, two more on the return
      journey, and that the best story earn the winner a free supper. </p>

        src="knight.png">The<b> <i>Knight's Tale</i></b>: a romance, a
      condensed version of Boccaccio's <i>Teseida</i>, set in ancient
      Athens. It tells of the love of two cousins, Palamon and Arcite,
      for the beautiful Emelye; the climax is a mock-battle, a
      tournament, the winner of which will win her; the gods Mars and
      Venus have both promised success to one of them. Arcite (servant
      of Mars) wins, but he dies of wounds after his horse has been
      frightened by a fury, and in the end Palamon (servant of Venus)
      marries Emelye. The tale explores the themes of determinism and
      freedom in ways reminiscent of the use of Boethius for the same
      purpose in <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i>. </p>
    <p>The <b><i>Miller's Prologue and Tale</i>:</b> a <i>fabliau</i>
      (coarse comic tale), about the cuckolding of John the Carpenter by
      an Oxford student, Nicholas, boarding with him and his wife
      Alison; Absolon, a young man from the local church, also tries to
      woo her, but is tricked into kissing her behind instead of her
      lips. Nicholas has deceived John into believing that Noah's Flood
      is about to come again, so John is asleep in a tub hanging high in
      the roof, ready to float to safety. Meanwhile Alison and Nicholas
      are in bed together. The climax of the tale is one of the finest
      comic moments in literature, when Absolon burns Nicholas's behind
      with a hot iron, Nicholas calls for water, John hears, thinks the
      flood has come, cuts the rope holding his tub, and crashes to the
      floor, breaking an arm. Only Alison escapes unscathed. The
      narrator offers no morality. </p>
    <p>The<i> <b>Reeve's Prologue and Tale</b></i>: a <i>fabliau</i>
      about the cuckolding of a miller told by the Reeve (who is a
      carpenter, and very angry with the Miller for his tale); two
      Cambridge students punish a dishonest miller by having sex with
      his wife and daughter while asleep all in one room. Again, the end
      involves violence, as the miller discovers what has happened but
      is struck on the head by his wife because his bald pate is all she
      can see in the dark. </p>

      marriages, while contesting the anti-feminist attitudes found in
      books that she quotes; indirectly, she becomes the proof of the
      truth of those books. Her Tale is a Breton Lay about a knight who
      rapes a girl, is obliged as punishment to find out what women most
      desire, learns from an old hag that the answer is "mastery over
      their husbands" and then has to marry her. She is a "loathly lady"
      but suddenly becomes beautiful when he gives her mastery over him
      after receiving a long lesson on the nature of true nobility. The
      tale is related to the ideas the Wife of Bath expresses in the

      popular romance, in rattling tail-rhyme stanzas (an four-stress
      couplet followed by a three-stress line, twice, the third and
      sixth line rhyming). The hero is called Sir Thopas, he is eager to
      love an elf-queen but as he arrives in fairy-land he meets a
      giant, whom he avoids. Soon after this, Harry Bailey, the
      inn-keeper, stops the tale: "Namoore of this, for Goddes
      dignitee!" And Chaucer the pilgrim explains that he can do no
      better in rhyme! </p>
    <p>Instead "Chaucer" offers to tell a "little thing" in prose, the <b>Tale
of

        Melibee</b> translated from French and covering twenty pages! It
      is more a treatise than a tale. It contains a vague story, but
      mostly consists of moral debate full of moral advice in pithy
      sententiae about the best way of dealing with problems and how to
      take advice. </p>
    <p>The M<b><i>onk's Prologue and Tale</i></b>: a series of seventeen
      "tragedies" of varying length, in the Fall of Princes tradition.
      The stories come from various sources, including the Bible and
      Boccaccio, and tell of "the deeds of Fortune" in the unhappy ends
      of famous people, including some near-contemporaries. At last the
      Knight stops the series, which claims to illustrate the power of
      Fortune, but becomes a list of pathetic case-histories. </p>
    <p>The <b><i>Nun's Priest's Prologue, Tale</i></b>, and <b><i>Epilogue</i></b>:
      a beast-fable told in a variety of styles, mock-heroic and
      pedantic mainly. In place of the brevity of the ordinary fable (cf
      Aesop) there are constant digressions and interminable speeches.
      The main characters are Chauntecleer and his lady Pertelote, a
      cock and a hen in a farmyard; Chauntecleer dreams of a fox (he has
      never seen one) and this leads to a debate on the meaning of
      dreams. A fox then appears, flatters Chauntecleer, then grabs him
      but the cock suggests he insult the people chasing him and escapes
      when the fox opens his mouth to speak. The moral of the tale for
      the reader is left unclear. </p>
    <p><a name="Fragment VIII"></a><b>Fragment VIII</b> </p>
    <p>The <b><i>Second Nun's Prologue and Tale</i></b>: a religious
      legend of the miracles and martyrdom of St Cecilia and her Roman
      husband Valerian. She instructs people to the end, even when her
      head has been almost completely cut off. </p>
    <p>The <b><i>Canon's Yeoman's Prologue and Tale</i></b>: suddenly
      two new characters come riding up to join the pilgrims, a rather
      dubious Canon who knows alchemy, and his companion who boasts
      about his master's science and knavery, then tells a bitter story
      about a canon who tricks a priest out of a lot of money by
      pretending to teach him how to make precious metals. The Prologue
      and Tale make up a vivid portrait unlike anything else found in
      the Tales, shifting as they do between the Yeoman's admiration for
      his master and his hatred of him and his devilish arts. </p>
    <p><a name="Fragment IX"></a><b>Fragment IX</b> </p>
    <p>The <b><i>Manciple's Prologue and Tale</i></b>: a tale found in
      Ovid about why the crow is black; it used to be white and could
      talk, until it told Phoebus that his wife was unfaithful. He kills
      her, then repents and punishes the bird. The tone of this tale is
      puzzling, it is neither pathetic nor comic. </p>
    <p><a name="Fragment X"></a><b>Fragment X</b> </p>
    <p>The <b><i>Parson's Prologue and Tale</i></b>: clearly designed
      to be the last tale in the collection, this is no "tale" but a
      long moral treatise translated from two Latin works on Penitence
      and on the Seven Deadly Sins. </p>
    <p>At the end of the Parson's Tale, in the <b><i>Retraccion</i></b>,
      the "maker of this book" asks Christ to forgive him: "<i>and
        namely my translations and enditings of worldly vanities, the
        which I revoke in my retractions: as is the book of Troilus; the
        book also of Fame; the book of the xxv ladies; the book of the
        Duchess; the book of St Valentine's Day of the Parliament of
        Birds; the tales of Canterbury, thilke that sowen into sin...</i>".

    </p>
    <p>Yet this<i> Retraction </i>serves to publicize Chaucer's works
      and had no effect on their later publication and distribution. </p>
    <p>The <i>Canterbury Tales</i> has always been among the most
      popular works of the English literary heritage. When <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Caxton</span> introduced printing
      into England, it was the first major secular work that he printed,
      in 1478, with a second corrected edition following in 1484. This
      was in turn reprinted three times, before William Thynne published
      <i>Chaucer's Collected Works</i> in 1532.<br>

    </p>
    <p>In the Reformation period, Chaucer's reputation as a precursor of
      the Reform movement was helped by the addition of a
      pro-Reformation <i>Plowman's Tale</i> in a 1542 edition. In 1561,
      even Lydgate's <i>Siege of Thebes</i> was added. The edition by
      Thomas Speght in 1598 was the first to offer a glossary; his text
      was revised in 1602 and this version was reprinted several times
      over the next hundred years, although Chaucer was not really to
      the taste of the Augustan readers. The first scholarly edition of
      the<i> Canterbury Tales</i> was published by Thomas Tyrwhitt in
      1775. </p>
    <p>In the last year of his life (1700) <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">John Dryden</span> wrote a major appreciation of Chaucer,
      based mainly on his knowledge of the <i>General Prologue</i> and
      certain tales which he had adapted into his own age's style: </p>
    <ul>
      <i>In the first place, as he is <span style="font-weight: bold;">the

          father of English poetry</span>, I hold him in the same degree
        of veneration as the Grecians held Homer, or the Romans Virgil.
        He is a perpetual fountain of good sense; learned in all
        sciences; and, therefore, speaks properly on all subjects. As he
        knew what to say, so he knows also when to leave off; a
        continence which is practiced by few writers, and scarcely by
        any of the ancients, excepting Virgil and Horace... Chaucer
        followed Nature everywhere, but was never so bold to go beyond
        her.... He must have been a man of a most wonderful
        comprehensive nature, because, as it has been truly observed of
        him, he has taken into the compass of his Canterbury Tales the
        various manners and humors (as we now call them) of the whole
        English nation in his age. Not a single character has escaped
        him.... there is such a variety of game springing up before me
        that I am distracted in my choice, and know not which to follow.
        'Tis sufficient to say, according to the proverb, that here is
        God's plenty.</i>

        the Canterbury Tales</font> </p>
    <p>Each Tale is presented as a separate 'work' which can be read and
      appreciated in its own right. There are many different classes of
      'Tale' ranging from the saint's life (SNT) and the theological
      treatise (ParsT) through romance (KT) to the fabliau (MilT, RvT).
      By creating the Pilgrimage framework, Chaucer adds an extra
      dimension to each Tale by attributing it to a more or less
      distinctly characterized pilgrim. The question of the relationship
      between each Tale and its fictional pilgrim-teller is much
      debated. Usually, once a Tale has begun, it continues to the end
      without further reference to the pilgrimage framework. The
      interruption of <i>Chaucer's Tale about Sir Thopas</i> and of the
      <i>Monk's Tale </i>about falls of princes by weary pilgrims, and
      of the Pardoner's final salesman's speech by an angry Host, are
      powerful exceptions. </p>
    <p>Each Tale has its own style, which is entirely determined by the
      kind of work it is, and is in no sense a 'dramatic' style
      reflecting the individuality of the proclaimed narrator. The
      Miller may be drunk, the narratorial voice of the Miller's Tale is
      not a drunken one. On the other hand, the Miller, we are told, is
      a 'churl' (line 3182) and he tells a churlish kind of story in
      terms of morality and respectability at least, no matter how
      brilliantly. The Knight is noble and his Tale is a romance of the
      kind associated with royal courts. There seems usually to be this
      kind of suitability of Tale to teller. </p>
    <p>However, it must be admitted that a number of Tales were left by
      Chaucer without any introductory pilgrimage link-passage, one
      sometimes being provided by editors in the 15th century, so that
      the attribution of them to a particular pilgrim may not be
      Chaucer's. The <i>Shipman's Tale</i> includes lines in which the
      pilgrim-narrator refers to himself as a woman. This may indicate
      that originally this tale about sex and money had been given to
      the Wife of Bath and that after she was given another tale Chaucer
      never had time to remove those lines. </p>
    <p>After the <i>General Prologue</i>, the pilgrims come into their
      own in brief <span style="font-weight: bold;">link-passages</span>
      which are in many cases full of tension as two or more of the
      rowdier pilgrims nearly come to blows. Always someone intervenes
      to restore order and the next Tale is introduced. Two pilgrims,
      the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Wife of Bath</span> and the
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pardoner</span>, are given a far
      more significant development. Each of them has a<span
        style="font-weight: bold;"> Prologue</span> of considerable
      length in which they become, as it were, the subject of their own
      self-telling. Each of these Prologues is rooted in traditions of
      satire but goes far beyond them in establishing a composite
      portrayal of a dynamic individual in dramatic monologue. </p>
    <p>The most important function of the pilgrimage framework, however,
      is the question it leaves hovering over each of the Tales as it is
      told: Is this Tale the best Tale? The Host's proposal of a contest
      invites the reader to judge all the Tales but at the same time
      requires the reader to reflect on the criteria by which the Tales
      are to be judged. What is the purpose of tale-telling, indeed of
      all discourse? <i>Sentence</i> or <i>solas</i>? Wisdom or
      pleasure? The value of a tale becomes more and more related to the
      value of life, and the Parson is not simply a kill-joy when he
      declares: 'Thou getest fable noon ytoold for me' (you get no fable
      told by me) and instead offers a treatise on sin and salvation.
      Chaucer leads the reader to the point where the ability of any
      fictional tale to tell the truth is challenged, though not
      necessarily as radically denied as the Parson would wish. The
      Parson himself is a fictional character, after all, a part of a
      Tale. </p>
    <p>The reader is at each moment invited to read the Tales in such a
      way as not to eliminate any of these dimensions.<br>
