      <p>An article called "Hiroshima" written by <a href="hersey.php">John Hersey</a>
was published
in <i>The New Yorker</i> magazine in August 1946, a year
after World
War II ended. The article was based on interviews with atomic bomb
survivors and tells their experiences the morning of the blast and
for the next few days and weeks. It was a calm and accurate account
of survival in the first city to be destroyed by a single weapon. </p>


      
      <p>There were many remarkable things about the "Hiroshoma"
article. Just a
few:<br>


      </p>


      
      <ul>


        <li>"Hiroshima" took over the entire issue of the <i>The
New Yorker</i>, there were no articles or cartoons. </li>


        <li>The issue caused a tremendous effect, and sold out
within hours. </li>


        <li>Many magazines and newspapers commented on the
article. </li>


        <li>The full text was read on the radio in the U.S. and
other countries. </li>


        <li>The Book-of-the-Month club sent a free copy in book
form to all its members. </li>


      
      </ul>


      
      <p>"Hiroshima" was quickly published as a book, and remains
in print
today.</p>

      <p>I spent a few weeks working on a term paper about the
publication
of "Hiroshima" for my one-and-only graduate level liberal arts
course (in 1997) and wanted to make my research available
to all who are interested (all 53 of you, that is).
My paper discusses the events leading up to the publication of the
article, what happened afterwards, and the effects of the article. </p>


     <p>Read the original article, published online by The New Yorker: <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1946/08/31/hiroshima">Hiroshima</a>.</p>

George Weller,
visited Nagasaki in September 1945, just a few weeks after the second
atomic bomb had been dropped there. He filed detailed stories about
what he saw there, but the articles were censored by the American
military. More info at the Wikipedia entry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Into_Nagasaki">First Into Nagasaki</a>.</font></p>


	<p><font size="1">In 2012 (15 years after doing my paper) I learned from a scholar in Spain that a remarkably similar paper had been
published in 1974 by a historian named Michael J. Yavenditti in <i>The Pacific Historical Review</i>. The article is available via jstor.org at 
<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3637589?origin=JSTOR-pdf&">http://www.jstor.org/stable/3637589?origin=JSTOR-pdf&</a>. If you are
doing serious research on this topic you probably need to get this paper. I didn't have access to this article when I was putting together
my stuff but it's clear from a quick review that we used a lot of the same sources.</font></p>
