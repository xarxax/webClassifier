Let Observation with extensive View,<br>
Survey Mankind, from <em>China</em> to <em>Peru</em>;<br>
Remark each anxious Toil, each eager Strife,<br>
And watch the busy Scenes of crouded Life;<br>
Then say how Hope and Fear, Desire and Hate,<br>
O'er spread with Snares the clouded Maze of Fate,<br>
Where wav'ring Man, betray'd by vent'rous Pride,<br>
To tread the dreary Paths without a Guide;<br>
As treach'rous Phantoms in the Mist delude,<br>
Shuns fancied Ills, or chases airy Good.<br>
How rarely Reason guides the stubborn Choice,<br>
Rules the bold Hand, or prompts the suppliant Voice,<br>
How Nations sink, by darling Schemes oppres'd,<br>
When Vengeance listens to the Fool's Request.<br>
Fate wings with ev'ry Wish th' afflictive Dart,<br>
Each Gift of Nature, and each Grace of Art,<br>
With fatal Heat impetuous Courage glows,<br>
With fatal Sweetness Elocution flows,<br>
Impeachment stops the Speaker's pow'rful Breath,<br>
And restless Fire precipitates on Death.<p>

But scarce observ'd the Knowing and the Bold,<br>
Fall in the gen'ral Massacre of Gold;<br>
Wide-wasting Pest! that rages unconfin'd,<br>
And crouds with Crimes the Records of Mankind,<br>
For Gold his Sword the Hireling Ruffian draws,<br>
For Gold the hireling Judge distorts the Laws;<br>
Wealth heap'd on Wealth, nor Truth nor Safety buys,<br>
The Dangers gather as the Treasures rise.<p>

Let Hist'ry tell where rival Kings command,<br>
And dubious Title shakes the madded Land,<br>
When Statutes glean the Refuse of the Sword,<br>
How much more safe the Vassal than the Lord,<br>
Low sculks the Hind beneath the Rage of Pow'r,<br>
And leaves the <em>bonny Traytor</em> in the <em>Tow'r</em>,<br>
Untouch'd his Cottage, and his Slumbers sound,<br>
Tho' Confiscation's Vulturs clang around.<p>

The needy Traveller, serene and gay,<br>
Walks the wild Heath, and sings his Toil away.<br>
Does Envy seize thee? crush th' upbraiding Joy,<br>
Encrease his Riches and his Peace destroy,<br>
New Fears in dire Vicissitude invade,<br>
The rustling Brake alarms, and quiv'ring Shade,<br>
Nor Light nor Darkness bring his Pain Relief,<br>
One shews the Plunder, and one hides the Thief.<p>
 
Yet still the gen'ral Cry the Skies assails<br>
And Gain and Grandeur load the tainted Gales;<br>
Few know the toiling Statesman's Fear or Care,<br>
Th' insidious Rival and the gaping Heir.<p>
 
Once more, <em>Democritus</em>, arise on Earth,<br>
With chearful Wisdom and instructive Mirth,<br>
See motley Life in modern Trappings dress'd,<br>
And feed with varied Fools th' eternal Jest:<br>
Thou who couldst laugh where Want enchain'd Caprice,<br>
Toil crush'd Conceit, and Man was of a Piece;<br>
Where Wealth unlov'd without a Mourner dy'd;<br>
And scarce a Sycophant was fed by Pride;<br>
Where ne'er was known the Form of mock Debate,<br>
Or seen a new-made Mayor's unwieldy State;<br>
Where change of Fav'rites made no Change of Laws,<br>
And Senates heard before they judg'd a Cause;<br>
How wouldst thou shake at <em>Britain</em>'s modish Tribe,<br>
Dart the quick Taunt, and edge the piercing Gibe?<br>
Attentive Truth and Nature to descry,<br>
And pierce each Scene with Philosophic Eye.<br>
To thee were solemn Toys or empty Shew,<br>
The Robes of Pleasure and the Veils of Woe:<br>
All aid the Farce, and all thy Mirth maintain,<br>
Whose Joys are causeless, or whose Griefs are vain.<p>

Such was the Scorn that fill'd the Sage's Mind,<br>
Renew'd at ev'ry Glance on Humankind;<br>
How just that Scorn ere yet thy Voice declare,<br>
Search every State, and canvass ev'ry Pray'r.<p>

Unnumber'd Suppliants croud Preferment's Gate,<br>
Athirst for Wealth, and burning to be great;<br>
Delusive Fortune hears th' incessant Call,<br>
They mount, they shine, evaporate, and fall.<br>
On ev'ry Stage the Foes of Peace attend,<br>
Hate dogs their Flight, and Insult mocks their End.<br>
Love ends with Hope, the sinking Statesman's Door<br>
Pours in the Morning Worshiper no more;<br>
For growing Names the weekly Scribbler lies,<br>
To growing Wealth the Dedicator flies,<br>
From every Room descends the painted Face,<br>
That hung the bright <em>Palladium</em> of the Place,<br>
And smoak'd in Kitchens, or in Auctions sold,<br>
To better Features yields the Frame of Gold;<br>
For now no more we trace in ev'ry Line<br>
Heroic Worth, Benevolence Divine:<br>
The Form distorted justifies the Fall,<br>
And Detestation rids th' indignant Wall.<p>

But will not <em>Britain</em> hear the last Appeal,<br>
Sign her Foes Doom, or guard her Fav'rites Zeal;<br>
Through Freedom's Sons no more Remonstrance rings,<br>
Degrading Nobles and controuling Kings;<br>
Our supple Tribes repress their Patriot Throats,<br>
And ask no Questions but the Price of Votes;<br>
With Weekly Libels and Septennial Ale,<br>
Their Wish is full to riot and to rail.<p>

In full-blown Dignity, see <em>Wolsey</em> stand,<br>
Law in his Voice, and Fortune in his Hand:<br>
To him the Church, the Realm, their Pow'rs consign,<br>
Thro' him the Rays of regal Bounty shine,<br>
Turn'd by his Nod the Stream of Honour flows,<br>
His Smile alone Security bestows:<br>
Still to new Heights his restless Wishes tow'r,<br>
Claim leads to Claim, and Pow'r advances Pow'r;<br>
Till Conquest unresisted ceas'd to please,<br>
And Rights submitted, left him none to seize.<br>
At length his Sov'reign frowns &mdash; the Train of State<br>
Mark the keen Glance, and watch the Sign to hate.<br>
Where-e'er he turns he meets a Stranger's Eye,<br>
His Suppliants scorn him, and his Followers fly;<br>
Now drops at once the Pride of aweful State,<br>
The golden Canopy, the glitt'ring Plate,<br>
The regal Palace, the luxurious Board,<br>
The liv'ried Army, and the menial Lord.<br>
With Age, with Cares, with Maladies oppress'd,<br>
He seeks the Refuge of Monastic Rest.<br>
Grief aids Disease, remember'd Folly stings,<br>
And his last Sighs reproach the Faith of Kings.<p>

Speak thou, whose Thoughts at humble Peace repine,<br>
Shall <em>Wolsey</em>'s Wealth, with <em>Wolsey</em>'s End be thine?<br>
Or liv'st thou now, with safer Pride content,<br>
The richest Landlord on the Banks of <em>Trent</em>?<br>
For why did <em>Wolsey</em> by the Steps of Fate,<br>
On weak Foundations raise th' enormous Weight<br>
Why but to sink beneath Misfortune's Blow,<br>
With louder Ruin to the Gulphs below?<p>

What gave great <em>Villiers</em> to th' Assassin's Knife,<br>
And fixed Disease on <em>Harley</em>'s closing life?<br>
What murder'd <em>Wentworth</em>, and what exil'd <em>Hyde</em>,<br>
By Kings protected and to Kings ally'd?<br>
What but their Wish indulg'd in Courts to shine,<br>
And Pow'r too great to keep or to resign?<p>

When first the College Rolls receive his Name,<br>
The young Enthusiast quits his Ease for Fame;<br>
Resistless burns the fever of Renown,<br>
Caught from the strong Contagion of the Gown;<br>
O'er <em>Bodley</em>'s Dome his future Labours spread,<br>
And <em>Bacon</em>'s Mansion trembles o'er his Head;<br>
Are these thy Views? proceed, illustrious Youth,<br>
And Virtue guard thee to the Throne of Truth,<br>
Yet should thy Soul indulge the gen'rous Heat,<br>
Till captive Science yields her last Retreat;<br>
Should Reason guide thee with her brightest Ray,<br>
And pour on misty Doubt resistless Day;<br>
Should no false Kindness lure to loose Delight,<br>
Nor Praise relax, nor Difficulty fright;<br>
Should tempting Novelty thy Cell refrain,<br>
And Sloth's bland Opiates shed their Fumes in vain;<br>
Should Beauty blunt on Fops her fatal Dart,<br>
Nor claim the triumph of a letter'd Heart;<br>
Should no Disease thy torpid Veins invade,<br>
Nor Melancholy's Phantoms haunt thy Shade;<br>
Yet hope not Life from Grief or Danger free,<br>
Nor think the Doom of Man revers'd for thee:<br>
Deign on the passing World to turn thine Eyes,<br>
And pause awhile from Learning to be wise;<br>
There mark what Ills the Scholar's Life assail,<br>
Toil, Envy, Want, the Garret, and the Jail.<br>
See Nations slowly wise, and meanly just,<br>
To buried Merit raise the tardy Bust.<br>
If Dreams yet flatter, once again attend,<br>
Hear <em>Lydiat</em>'s Life, and <em>Galileo</em>'s End.<p>

Nor deem, when Learning her lost Prize bestows<br>
The glitt'ring Eminence exempt from Foes;<br>
See when the Vulgar 'scap'd despis'd or aw'd,<br>
Rebellion's vengeful Talons seize on <em>Laud</em>.<br>
From meaner Minds, tho' smaller Fines content<br>
The plunder'd Palace or sequester'd Rent;<br>
Mark'd out by dangerous Parts he meets the Shock,<br>
And fatal Learning leads him to the Block:<br>
Around his Tomb let Art and Genius weep,<br>
But hear his Death, ye Blockheads, hear and sleep.<p>

The festal Blazes, the triumphal Show,<br>
The ravish'd Standard, and the captive Foe,<br>
The Senate's Thanks, the Gazette's pompous Tale,<br>
With Force resistless o'er the Brave prevail.<br>
Such Bribes the rapid <em>Greek</em> o'er <em>Asia</em> whirl'd,<br>
For such the steady <em>Romans</em> shook the World;<br>
For such in distant Lands the <em>Britons</em> shine,<br>
And stain with Blood the <em>Danube</em> or the <em>Rhine</em>;<br>
This Pow'r has Praise, that Virtue scarce can warm,<br>
Till Fame supplies the universal Charm.<br>
Yet Reason frowns on War's unequal Game,<br>
Where wasted Nations raise a single Name,<br>
And mortgag'd States their Grandsires Wreaths regret<br>
From Age to Age in everlasting Debt;<br>
Wreaths which at last the dear-bought Right convey<br>
To rust on Medals, or on Stones decay.<p>

On what Foundation stands the Warrior's Pride?<br>
How just his Hopes let <em>Swedish Charles</em> decide;<br>
A Frame of Adamant, a Soul of Fire,<br>
No Dangers fright him, and no Labours tire;<br>
O'er Love, o'er Force, extends his wide Domain,<br>
Unconquer'd Lord of Pleasure and of Pain;<br>
No Joys to him pacific Scepters yield,<br>
War sounds the Trump, he rushes to the Field;<br>
Behold surrounding Kings their Pow'r combine,<br>
And One capitulate, and One resign;<br>
Peace courts his Hand, but spread her Charms in vain;<br>
"Think Nothing gain'd, he cries, till nought remain,<br>
"On <em>Moscow</em>'s Walls till <em>Gothic</em> Standards fly,<br>
"And all is Mine beneath the Polar Sky."<br>
The March begins in Military State,<br>
And Nations on his Eye suspended wait;<br>
Stern Famine guards the solitary Coast,<br>
And Winter barricades the Realms of Frost;<br>
He comes, nor Want nor Cold his Course delay;&mdash;-<br>
Hide, blushing Glory, hide <em>Pultowa</em>'s Day:<br>
The vanquish'd Hero leaves his broken Bands,<br>
And shews his Miseries in distant Lands;<br>
Condemn'd a needy Supplicant to wait,<br>
While Ladies interpose, and Slaves debate.<br>
But did not Chance at length her Error mend?<br>
Did no subverted Empire mark his End?<br>
Did rival Monarchs give the fatal Wound?<br>
Or hostile Millions press him to the Ground?<br>
His Fall was destin'd to a barren Strand,<br>
A petty Fortress, and a dubious Hand;<br>
He left the Name, at which the World grew pale,<br>
To point a Moral, or adorn a Tale.<p>

All Times their Scenes of pompous Woes afford,<br>
From <em>Persia</em>'s Tyrant to <em>Bavaria</em>'s Lord.<br>
In gay Hostility, and barb'rous Pride,<br>
With half Mankind embattled at his Side,<br>
Great <em>Xerxes</em> comes to seize the certain Prey,<br>
And starves exhausted Regions in his Way;<br>
Attendant Flatt'ry counts his Myriads o'er,<br>
Till counted Myriads sooth his Pride no more;<br>
Fresh Praise is try'd till Madness fires his Mind,<br>
The Waves he lashes, and enchains the Wind;<br>
New Pow'rs are claim'd, new Pow'rs are still bestowed,<br>
Till rude Resistance lops the spreading God;<br>
The daring <em>Greeks</em> deride the Martial Shew,<br>
And heap their Vallies with the gaudy Foe;<br>
Th' insulted Sea with humbler Thoughts he gains,<br>
A single Skiff to speed his Flight remains;<br>
Th' incumber'd Oar scarce leaves the dreaded Coast<br>
Through purple Billows and a floating Host.<p>

The bold <em>Bavarian</em>, in a luckless Hour,<br>
Tries the dread Summits of <em>Cesarean</em> Pow'r,<br>
With unexpected Legions bursts away,<br>
And sees defenceless Realms receive his Sway;<br>
Short Sway! fair <em>Austria</em> spreads her mournful Charms,<br>
The Queen, the Beauty, sets the World in Arms;<br>
From Hill to Hill the Beacons rousing Blaze<br>
Spreads wide the Hope of Plunder and of Praise;<br>
The fierce <em>Croatian</em>, and the wild <em>Hussar</em>,<br>
And all the Sons of Ravage croud the War;<br>
The baffled Prince in Honour's flatt'ring Bloom<br>
Of hasty Greatness finds the fatal Doom,<br>
His foes Derision, and his Subjects Blame,<br>
And steals to Death from Anguish and from Shame.<p>

Enlarge my Life with Multitude of Days,<br>
In Health, in Sickness, thus the Suppliant prays;<br>
Hides from himself his State, and shuns to know,<br>
That Life protracted is protracted Woe.<br>
Time hovers o'er, impatient to destroy,<br>
And shuts up all the Passages of Joy:<br>
In vain their Gifts the bounteous Seasons pour,<br>
The Fruit autumnal, and the Vernal Flow'r,<br>
With listless Eyes the Dotard views the Store,<br>
He views, and wonders that they please no more;<br>
Now pall the tastless Meats, and joyless Wines,<br>
And Luxury with Sighs her Slave resigns.<br>
Approach, ye Minstrels, try the soothing Strain,<br>
And yield the tuneful Lenitives of Pain:<br>
No Sounds alas would touch th' impervious Ear,<br>
Though dancing Mountains witness'd <em>Orpheus</em> near;<br>
Nor Lute nor Lyre his feeble Pow'rs attend,<br>
Nor sweeter Musick of a virtuous Friend,<br>
But everlasting Dictates croud his Tongue,<br>
Perversely grave, or positively wrong.<br>
The still returning Tale, and ling'ring Jest,<br>
Perplex the fawning Niece and pamper'd Guest,<br>
While growing Hopes scarce awe the gath'ring Sneer,<br>
And scarce a Legacy can bribe to hear;<br>
The watchful Guests still hint the last Offence,<br>
The Daughter's Petulance, the Son's Expence,<br>
Improve his heady Rage with treach'rous Skill,<br>
And mould his Passions till they make his Will.<p>

Unnumber'd Maladies each Joint invade,<br>
Lay Siege to Life and press the dire Blockade;<br>
But unextinguish'd Av'rice still remains,<br>
And dreaded Losses aggravate his Pains;<br>
He turns, with anxious Heart and cripled Hands,<br>
His Bonds of Debt, and Mortgages of Lands;<br>
Or views his Coffers with suspicious Eyes,<br>
Unlocks his Gold, and counts it till he dies.<p>

But grant, the Virtues of a temp'rate Prime<br>
Bless with an Age exempt from Scorn or Crime;<br>
An Age that melts in unperceiv'd Decay,<br>
And glides in modest Innocence away;<br>
Whose peaceful Day Benevolence endears,<br>
Whose Night congratulating Conscience cheers;<br>
The gen'ral Fav'rite as the gen'ral Friend:<br>
Such Age there is, and who could wish its end?<p>

Yet ev'n on this her Load Misfortune flings,<br>
To press the weary Minutes flagging Wings:<br>
New Sorrow rises as the Day returns,<br>
A Sister sickens, or a Daughter mourns.<br>
Now Kindred Merit fills the sable Bier,<br>
Now lacerated Friendship claims a Tear.<br>
Year chases Year, Decay pursues Decay,<br>
Still drops some Joy from with'ring Life away;<br>
New Forms arise, and diff'rent Views engage,<br>
Superfluous lags the Vet'ran on the Stage,<br>
Till pitying Nature signs the last Release,<br>
And bids afflicted Worth retire to Peace.<p>

But few there are whom Hours like these await,<br>
Who set unclouded in the Gulphs of fate.<br>
From <em>Lydia</em>'s monarch should the Search descend,<br>
By <em>Solon</em> caution'd to regard his End,<br>
In Life's last Scene what Prodigies surprise,<br>
Fears of the Brave, and Follies of the Wise?<br>
From <em>Marlb'rough</em>'s Eyes the Streams of Dotage flow,<br>
And <em>Swift</em> expires a Driv'ler and a Show.<p>

The teeming Mother, anxious for her Race,<br>
Begs for each Birth the Fortune of a Face:<br>
Yet <em>Vane</em> could tell what Ills from Beauty spring;<br>
And <em>Sedley</em> curs'd the Form that pleas'd a King.<br>
Ye Nymphs of rosy Lips and radiant Eyes,<br>
Whom Pleasure keeps too busy to be wise,<br>
Whom Joys with soft Varieties invite<br>
By Day the Frolick, and the Dance by Night,<br>
Who frown with Vanity, who smile with Art,<br>
And ask the latest Fashion of the Heart,<br>
What Care, what Rules your heedless Charms shall save,<br>
Each Nymph your Rival, and each Youth your Slave?<br>
An envious Breast with certain Mischief glows,<br>
And Slaves, the Maxim tells, are always Foes.<br>
Against your Fame with Fondness Hate combines,<br>
The Rival batters, and the Lover mines.<br>
With distant Voice neglected Virtue calls,<br>
Less heard, and less the faint Remonstrance falls;<br>
Tir'd with Contempt, she quits the slipp'ry Reign,<br>
And Pride and Prudence take her Seat in vain.<br>
In croud at once, where none the Pass defend,<br>
The harmless Freedom, and the private Friend.<br>
The Guardians yield, by Force superior ply'd;<br>
By Int'rest, Prudence; and by Flatt'ry, Pride.<br>
Here Beauty falls betray'd, despis'd, distress'd,<br>
And hissing Infamy proclaims the rest.<p>

Where then shall Hope and Fear their Objects find?<br>
Must dull Suspence corrupt the stagnant Mind?<br>
Must helpless Man, in Ignorance sedate,<br>
Swim darkling down the Current of his Fate?<br>
Must no Dislike alarm, no Wishes rise,<br>
No Cries attempt the Mercies of the Skies?<br>
Enquirer, cease, Petitions yet remain,<br>
Which Heav'n may hear, nor deem Religion vain.<br>
Still raise for Good the supplicating Voice,<br>
But leave to Heav'n the Measure and the Choice.<br>
Safe in his Pow'r, whose Eyes discern afar<br>
The secret Ambush of a specious Pray'r.<br>
Implore his Aid, in his Decisions rest,<br>
Secure whate'er he gives, he gives the best.<br>
Yet with the Sense of sacred Presence prest,<br>
When strong Devotion fills thy glowing Breast,<br>
Pour forth thy Fervours for a healthful Mind,<br>
Obedient Passions, and a Will resign'd;<br>
For Love, which scarce collective Man can fill;<br>
For Patience sov'reign o'er transmuted Ill;<br>
For Faith, that panting for a happier Seat,<br>
Thinks Death kind Nature's Signal of Retreat:<br>
These Goods for Man the Laws of Heav'n ordain,<br>
These Goods he grants, who grants the Pow'r to gain;<br>
With these celestial Wisdom calms the Mind,<br>
And makes the Happiness she does not find.
