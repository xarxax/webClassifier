      <h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many creative writers have used historical material in their work. Kate Grenville reflects on her own use of such material and on issues which this has raised. How important is historical accuracy to the creative process?</font></h2>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When Jill Roe said of history 
  &quot;Getting it right means you can’t make it up&quot;, it was a reminder to 
  novelists like me that, although we might use history, we also have to respect 
  it. It’s all very well to play fast and loose with historical truths, but there 
  comes a point when you have to get it right, or try to at least. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a novelist, my relationship 
  to history has always been pretty much the same relationship the Goths had to 
  Rome. ( Wait - was it Rome? Was it Goths?) History for a greedy novelist like 
  me is just one more place to pillage.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What we’re after, of course, 
  is stories, and we know that history is bulging with beauties. Having found 
  them, we then proceed to fiddle with them to make them the way we want them 
  to be, rather than the way they really were. We get it wrong, willfully and 
  knowingly.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But perhaps you could say 
  that the very flagrency of our &quot;getting it wrong&quot; points to the fact 
  that all stories ­ even the history &quot;story&quot; ­ are made. They have 
  an agenda, even if it’s an unconscious one. Perhaps there are many ways to get 
  it right. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The interesting parts of history 
  are probably always what’s not there. My own special area of interest about 
  what’s not in history is the women. As you would all know, by and large they’re 
  sadly absent from the historical record. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, I’m lucky to be 
  the recipient&#151;custodian, even, if that doesn’t sound too grandiose&#151;of a rich 
  oral history handed down from my mother, who got it from her mother and so on 
  back down the line. She’s told me family stories from every generation since 
  our family first came to Australia&#151;in the form of our wicked convict ancestor 
  Solomon Wiseman, in 1806. Sol is supposed to have murdered his wife, and turned 
  his daughter&#151;pregnant to the riding-master&#151;out of the house to starve. (But 
  perhaps, the novelist in me thinks, she didn’t starve , but went on to have, 
  well, a story…) There was &quot;Uncle Willie with the red hair&quot; who was 
  &quot;killed [by falling] off a horse when he was eighteen and broke his mother’s heart.&quot; 
  There was her own mother, in love with a Catholic boy&#151;a love as unthinkable 
  as between a Montagu and a Capulet ­ and was forced to marry a good Protestant 
  boy. You should see the look on her face in the wedding photos.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This oral history, handed 
  down in a series of formalised anecdotes from mother to daughter, leaving rich 
  areas for speculation in between is, I suspect, one of the things that’s made 
  me a novelist.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was stories about the 
  Sydney eccentric Bea Miles that led me to write <i>Lilian’s Story</i>. Every Sydney 
  cabbie, even ones who couldn’t have been born when she was in her heyday, 
  have their Bea Miles story. Each one swears it was his taxi that she ripped 
  the door off, that it was he who made her take a bath in the Archibald Fountain. 
  They all own her history, they’ve made it ­ by a sort of historical sleight-of-hand 
   their own. All I had to do, as a novelist, was to take some of those stories 
  and extrapolate from them, turning them to my own purposes. Those purposes probably 
  didn’t have too much to do with the 'real' Bea Miles. What I found 
  interesting in her story was not so much the real woman herself, but more the 
  idea that, in a time when women were supposed to be the passive objects in the 
  stories of men, she wrote her own story on the blank pages of her city.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Writing <i>Lilian’s Story</i> gave 
  me a taste for re-writing history for my own purposes. With <i>Joan Makes History</i> 
  I went the whole hog. It was supposed to be a parodic history of Australia&#151;our history re-made in the image of the women rather than the men. I was indignant 
  with history, on behalf of all the women it belittled or by-passed. I thought 
  I agreed with Ford that history was bunk.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I came to mock history, 
  but stayed to pray. My epiphany albeit a humbling one, was reading 
  Manning Clark. Here was a historian not hiding behind a mask of &quot;objectivity&quot; 
  but being shamelessly personal. If I thought, in my ignorance, that I was going 
  to put the &quot;story&quot; back into &quot;history&quot; I had to recognise 
  that he had already done it, with a breadth of vision and depth of knowledge 
  no novelist could match.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Dark Places</i> could function 
  as an example of history as smokescreen. This is a book about a man who violates 
  his daughter&#151;a subject almost too awful to look at straight-on. Setting the 
  story in the early decades of the twentie<sup>th</sup> century gave the writer&#151;and also the reader&#151;enough distance on the story to make it bearable, and 
  to let the larger theme be heard. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That book is about history 
  in another way too. The book is told in the voice of the violating father, and 
  what we hear his voice doing is willfully misreading the facts of the world 
  around him. He distorts everything he sees and hears so that he thinks he’s 
  justified in doing what he does. In a way the book is not so much about an individual 
  monster as about the idea of subjectivity of the dangerously seductive power 
  of distorted truth.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <i>Idea of Perfection</i> is 
  about a little country town split down the middle on what you should do with 
  history. On one side are those who want to keep the crummy but picturesque old 
  Bent Bridge, and the tatty old bush quilts that everyone’s granny used to make. 
  On the other side are the ones who want to whack in a nice tidy concrete bridge 
  ( no rot, no mess, see you right for years) and take the smelly old quilts to 
  the tip. In those circles there’s a kind of shame about history: its messiness, 
  its jumble of good and evil, nobility and pettiness&#151;in a word its human-ness. 
  They’re right&#151;it is tricky, finding a way to live with history, to accommodate 
  its reality with the image we like to have of ourselves.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There’s a love story going 
  in the book between two people who, like the bridge and the old quilts, are 
  far from perfect middle-aged people with the usual amount of baggage they‘d 
  rather not have. ( For a while I thought the book might be called &quot;Frumps 
  in Love&quot; but my publisher talked me out of it. ) They’re burdened with 
  their own personal histories ­ perhaps that’s why they both find their way to 
  defending the history they find in Karakarook, NSW, population 1734.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The frumps come to see that 
  the idea of perfection is a dangerous one. You’re better off just being human. 
  It’s the very fallibility of these two&#151;all their history&#151;that brings them 
  together. As Leonardo said about bridges, and which is also true of human relationships: 
  &quot;An arch is two weaknesses that together make a strength&quot;. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The the bank manager’s wife 
  is taking the other tack. She was born pretty and has always been pretty&#151;until 
  now. Now she’s forty ( only just forty, she tells herself), and her history 
  is starting to show on her face, the way it does. But she’s not going to let 
  it. By sheer force of will she’s detemined to stop the slightest suspicion of 
  wrinkles ever appearing on her perfect face. She goes to grotesque lengths, 
  deciding, for example, to cut down on wrinkles by limiting her smiles. Two a 
  day seems perfectly adequate. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, Felicity Porcelline 
  can try, Canute-like, to hold back the tide of history on her face, but things 
  squashed down too hard tend finally to erupt in a nasty way. Poor old Felicity 
  comes to a sticky end.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Not long ago it was a shameful 
  thing to have a convict in your family tree, but things are different now&#151;our history has moved so far that there’s now a kind of &quot;convict-chic&quot;. I’m not 
  sure if this is any better than the urge to hide the &quot;taint&quot; in our 
  family trees.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I don’t know if there is 
  a story somewhere in Sol Wiseman, but my writing fingers are getting itchy to 
  try it out. I’ve always worked in a certain amount of chaos&#151;writing bits and 
  pieces and putting them together in an exploratory way until a novel finally 
  emerges. But inside every slob is an obsessive waiting to get out. The Sol Wiseman 
  story may be the one where, finally, I get to live out what I think of as the 
  Card Index Fantasy. I’ll get myself organised. I’ll be orderly and systematic. 
  I’ll find out everything there is to know about Solomon Wiseman. I’ll write 
  it all on numbered index cards. Maybe I’ll even colour-code them. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In fact, of course, I suspect 
  I’ll do my usual smash-and-grab raid on history. I’ll research only until I 
  find something juicy, and then I’ll run off with it and turn it into something 
  else. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> My justification for doing 
  this has always been that, in distorting the details of &quot;real&quot; history, 
  I was serving a larger good&#151;giving flesh and form to an idea. When I wrote 
  <i>Lilian’s Story</i> it seemed perfectly all right to invent for my character whatever 
  history would best dramatise my idea about women and their stories. So I invented 
  a monstrous father, and then went on to write his book as well as the book of 
  his daughter. From the tiny germ of truth sprang an entire family tree of fictions. 
  These fictions seemed to carry ideas that needed airing, seemed justifiable 
  because they made readers consider ideas they might not otherwise want to deal 
  with. One truth was distorted, but another was revealed. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now I’m not so sure if this 
  is really justifiable. The trouble is that germ of truth at the root of the 
  fictional tree&#151;does the novelist really have the right to take that and graft 
  fabrication onto it, so that the border between the invented and the real becomes 
  blurred? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perhaps we should stick 
  to pure invention ­ except that I suspect there’s no such thing. It’s real life, 
  and real history, that provides all the best ideas. Anything we can invent will 
  only be the palest imitation of the richness of reality. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I think all we as story-tellers 
  can do is to pay tribute to history and acknowledge it as the first great story. 
  And when we start to get too big for our boots we can remind ourselves that 
  history, and the recounting of history, will go on after our novels are forgotten.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In closing, I’d like to 
  thank you for the opportunity to be here today. It’s been fascinating to hear 
  historians talk about what they do. I’m full of awe and admiration. Thank you 
  all. </font></p>
