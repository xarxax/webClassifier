Bennett is best known, however, for his novels, several of which were written
during his residence in France.&nbsp;</font>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bennett did not pursue a
    career as a writer until after leaving his father's practice and moving to
    London in 1889 when he won a literary competition in &quot;Tit Bits&quot;
    magazine. Encouraged to take up journalism full-time he became assistant
    editor of &quot;Woman&quot; in 1894.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Just over four years later
      his first novel &quot;A Man from the North&quot; was published to critical
      acclaim, followed in 1902 by &quot;Anna of the Five Towns&quot;, the first
      of a succession of stories which detailed life in the Potteries and
      displayed his unique vision of life in its towns.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font COLOR="#6d0000" size="2" face="Verdana">Between the
    end of 1903 and 1911 Bennett lived mainly in Paris. During this time he
    continued to enjoy critical success with the publication of many novels
    including &quot;The Old Wives Tale&quot; (1908). After a visit to America in
    1911 where he had been publicised and acclaimed as no other visiting writer
    had been since Dickens he returned to England where the &quot;Old Wives
    Tale&quot; was reappraised and hailed to be a masterpiece.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Verdana" size="2">By 1922 he had separated from
    his French wife, but shortly thereafter he fell in love with the actress
    Dorothy Cheston and lived with her until his death in 1931 from typhoid. His
    ashes are buried in Burslem cemetery.&nbsp;<br>
    Their daughter Virginia Eldin now living in France is today the President of
    the Arnold Bennett Society.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font COLOR="#6d0000" size="2" face="Verdana">Although
    Arnold Bennett never returned to the Potteries to live he never forgot the
    debt which he owed to his birthplace for giving him a unique setting for so
    many of his novels, a setting which he enhanced with his penetrating
    description of people and places.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font COLOR="#6d0000" size="2" face="Verdana">It is perhaps
    unfortunate that Bennett felt the &quot;The Five Towns&quot; sounded more
    euphonious then &quot;The Six Towns&quot;, and thus relegated the town of
    Fenton almost to literary oblivion, but as a chronicler of The Potteries he
    assured for the district a permanent place in English literature.<br>
