<ul><p> <a name="gar"> <b>Friendship's Garland </a> </b>
<p> When I was a boy there was a friend of mine,
<br>We thought ourselves warriors and grown folk swine,
<br>Stupid old animals who never understood
<br>And never had an impulse, and said "You must be good!"
<p>
We stank like stoats and fled like foxes,
<br>We put cigarettes in the pillar-boxes,
<br>Lighted cigarettes and letters all aflame--
<br>O the surprise when the postman came!
<p>
We stole eggs and apples and made fine hay
<br>In people's houses when people were away,
<br>We broke street lamps and away we ran;
<br>Then I was a boy but now I am a man.
<p>
Now I am a man and don't have any fun,
<br>I hardly ever shout and never never run,
<br>And I don't care if he's dead, that friend of mine,
<br>For then I was a boy and now I am a swine.
<br><br></ul>

<br><br> <ul><a name="wenot"> <b>We Are Not Amused </b></a> 
<p> Puck and the woodland elves shall weep with me
<br>For that lost joke I made in Ledborough Lane,
<br>The joke that Mrs. Baines declined to see
<br>Although I made it very loud and plain.
<br>I made the joke again and yet again,
<br>I analysed it, parsed it and explained:
<br>I did my very best to entertain,
<br>But Mrs. Baines would not be entertained.
<br><br></ul>

<ul><a name="donk"> <b>The Donkey</b></a>
<p>
When forests walked and fishes flew
<br>And figs grew upon thorn,
<br>Some moment when the moon was blood,
<br>Then, surely, I was born.
<p>
With monstrous head and sickening bray
<br>And ears like errant wings--
<br>The devil's walking parody
<br>Of all four-footed things:
<p>
The battered outlaw of the earth
<br>Of ancient crooked will;
<br>Scourge, beat, deride me--I am dumb--
<br>I keep my secret still.
<p>
Fools! For I also had my hour--
<br>One far fierce hour and sweet:
<br>There was a shout around my head
<br>And palms about my feet.

<ul><a name="cole"> <b>Variations of an Air </b></a>
<p>
<ul><i>after Lord Tennyson</i></ul>
<p>
Cole, that unwearied prince of Colchester,
<br>Growing more gay with age and with long days
<br>Deeper in laughter and desire of life
<br>As that Virginian climber on our walls
<br>Flames scarlet with the fading of the year;
<br>Called for his wassail and that other weed
<br>Virginian also, from the western woods
<br>Where English Raleigh checked the boast of Spain,
<br>And lighting joy with joy, and piling up
<br>Pleasure as crown for pleasure, bade me bring
<br>Those three, the minstrels whose emblazoned coats
<br>Shone with the oyster-shells of Colchester;
<br>And these three played, and playing grew more fain
<br>Of mirth and music; till the heathen came
<br>And the King slept beside the northern sea.
<p>
<ul><i>after W.B. Yeats</i></ul>
<p>
Of an old King in a story
<br>From the grey sea-folk I have heard
<br>Whose heart was no more broken
<br>Than the wings of a bird.
<p>
As soon as the moon was silver
<br>And the thin stars began,
<br>He took his pipe and his tankard,
<br>Like an old peasant man.
<p>
And three tall shadows were with him
<br>And came at his command;
<br>And played before him for ever
<br>The fiddles of fairyland.
<p>
And he died in the young summer
<br>Of the world's desire;
<br>Before our hearts were broken
<br>Like sticks in a fire.
<p>
<ul><i>after Walt Whitman</i></ul>
<p>
Me clairvoyant,
<br>Me conscious of you, old camarado,
<br>Needing no telescope, lorgnette, field-glass, opera-glass, myopic pince-nez,
<br>Me piercing two thousand years with eye naked and not ashamed;
<br>The crown cannot hide you from me,
<br>Musty old feudal-heraldic trappings cannot hide you from me,
<br>I perceive that you drink.
<br>(I am drinking with you. I am as drunk as you are.)
<br>I see you are inhaling tobacco, puffing, smoking, spitting
<br>(I do not object to your spitting),
<br>You prophetic of American largeness,
<br>You anticipating the broad masculine manners of these States;
<br>I see in you also there are movements, tremors, tears, desire for the melodious,
<br>I salute your three violinists, endlessly making vibrations,
<br>Rigid, relentless, capable of going on for ever;
<br>They play my accompaniment; but I shall take no notice of any accompaniment;
<br>I myself am a complete orchestra.
<br>So long.
