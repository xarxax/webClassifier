I've paid for your sickest fancies; I've humoured your crackedest whim -<br>
Dick, it's your daddy, dying; you've got to listen to him! <br>
Good for a fortnight, am I? The doctor told you? He lied. <br>
I shall go under by morning, and -  Put that nurse outside. <br>
'Never seen death yet, Dickie? Well, now is your time to learn,<br>
And you'll wish you held my record before it comes to your turn.<br>
Not counting the Line and the Foundry, the yards and the village, too, <br>
I've made myself and a million; but I'm damned if I made you.<br>
Master at two-and-twenty, and married at twenty-three - <br>
Ten thousand men on the pay-roll, and forty freighters at sea ! <br>
Fifty years between' em, and every year of it fight,<br>
And now I'm Sir Anthony Gloster, dying, a baronite:<br>
For I lunched with his Royal 'Ighness - what was it the papers had ? <br>
"Not the least of our merchant-princes."  Dickie, that's me, your dad! <br>
<I>I</I> didn't begin with askings. I took my job and I stuck;<br>
I took the chances they wouldn't, an' now they're calling it luck. <br>
Lord, what boats I've handled - rotten and leaky and old - <br>
Ran 'em, or - opened the bilge-cock, precisely as I was told. <br>
Grub that 'ud bind you crazy, and crews that 'ud turn you grey, <br>
And a big fat lump of insurance to cover the risk on the way. <br>
The others they dursn't do it; they said they valued their life <br>
(They've served me since as skippers). I went, and I took my wife. <br>
Over the world I drove 'em, married at twenty-three,<br>
And your mother saving the money and making a man of me.<br>
I was content to be master, but she said there was better behind;<br>
She took the chances I wouldn't, and I followed your mother blind.<br>
She egged me to borrow the money, an' she helped me to clear the loan,<br>
When we bougnt half-shares in a cheap 'un and hoisted a flag of our own.<br>
Patching and coaling on credit, and living the Lord knew how,<br>
We started the Red Ox freighters - we've eight-and-thirty now.<br>
And those were the days of clippers, and the freights were clipper-freights,<br>
And we knew we were making our fortune, but she died in Macassar Straits - <br>
By the Little Patemosters, as you come to the Union Bank - <br>
And we dropped her in fourteen fathom: I pricked it off where she sank.<br>
Owners we were, full owners, and the boat was christened for her,<br>
And she died in the <I>Mary Gloster.</I> My heart; how young we were!<br>
So I went on a spree round Java and well-nigh ran her ashore,<br>
But your mother came and warned me and I would't liquor no more:<br>
Strict I stuck to my business, afraid to stop or I'd think,<br>
Saving the money (she warned me), and letting the other men drink.<br>
And I met M'Cullough in London (I'd saved five 'undred then),<br>
And 'tween us we started the Foundry - three forges and twenty men.<br>
Cheap repairs for the cheap 'uns. It paid, and the business grew;<br>
For I bought me a steam-lathe patent, and that was a gold mine too.<br>
"Cheaper to build 'em than buy 'em;" <I>I</I> said, but M'Cullough he shied,<br>
And we wasted a year in talking before we moved to the Clyde.<br>
And the Lines were all beginning, and we all of us started fair,<br>
Building our engines like houses and staying the boilers square.<br>
But M'Cullough 'e wanted cabins with marble and maple and all,<br>
And Brussels an' Utrecht velvet, and baths and a Social Hall,<br>
And pipes for closets all over, and cutting the frames too light,<br>
But M'Cullough he died in the Sixties, and -  Well, I'm dying to-night... <br>
I knew - <I>I</I> knew what was coming, when we bid on the <I>Byfleet's </i>keel - <br>
They piddled and piffled with iron, I'd given my orders for steel!<br>
Steel and the first expansions. It paid, I tell you, it paid,<br>
When we came with our nine-knot freighters and collared the long-run trade!<br>
And they asked me how I did it; and I gave 'em the Scripture text,<br>
"You keep your light so shining a little in front o' the next!"<br>
They copied all they could follow, but they couldn't copy my mind,<br>
And I left 'em sweating and stealing a year and a half behind.<br>
Then came the armour-contracts, but that was M'Cullough's side;<br>
He was always best in the Foundry, but better, perhaps, he died.<br>
I went through his private papers; the notes was plainer than print;<br>
And I'm no fool to finish if a man'll give me a hint.<br>
(I remember his widow was angry.) So I saw what his drawings meant;<br>
And I started the six-inch rollers, and it paid me sixty per cent.<br>
Sixty per cent <I>with</I> failures, and more than twice we could do,<br>
And a quarter-million to credit, and I saved it all for you!<br>
I thought - it doesn't matter - you seemed to favour your ma,<br>
But you're nearer forty than thirty, and I know the kind you are.<br>
Harrer an' Trinity College! I ought to ha' sent you to sea - <br>
But I stood you an education, an' what have you done for me?<br>
<A NAME="rotten">
The things I knew was proper you wouldn't thank me to give,</a><br>
And the things I knew was rotten you said was the way to live.<br>
For you muddled with books and pictures, an' china an' etchin's an' fans. <br>
And your rooms at college was beastly - more like a whore's than a man's;<br>
Till you married that thin-flanked woman, as white and as stale as a bone,<br>
An' she gave you your social nonsense; but where's that kid o' your own?<br>
I've seen your carriages blocking the half o' the Cromwell Road,<br>
But never the doctor's brougham to help the missus unload.<br>
(So there isn't even a grandchild, an' the Gloster family's done.)<br>
Not like your mother, she isn't. She carried her freight each run.<br>
But they died, the pore little beggars! At sea she had 'em - they died.<br>
Only you, an' you stood it. You haven't stood much beside.<br>
Weak, a liar, and idle, and mean as a collier's whelp<br>
Nosing for scraps in the galley. No help - my son was no help!<br>
So he gets three 'undred thousand, in trust and the interest paid.<br>
I wouldn't give it you, Dickie - you see, I made it in trade.<br>
You're saved from soiling your fingers, and if you have no child,<br>
It all comes back to the business. 'Gad, won't your wife be wild!<br>
'Calls and calls in her carriage, her 'andkerchief up to 'er eye:<br>
"Daddy! dear daddy's dyin'!" and doing her best to cry.<br>
Grateful? Oh, yes, I'm grateful, but keep her away from here.<br>
Your mother 'ud never ha' stood 'er, and, anyhow, women are queer.<br>
There's women will say I've married a second time. Not quite!<br>
But give pore Aggie a hundred, and tell her your lawyers'll fight.<br>
She was the best o' the boiling - you'll meet her before it ends.<br>
I'm in for a row with the mother - I'll leave you settle my friends.<br>
For a man he must go with a woman, which women don't understand - <br>
Or the sort that say they can see it they aren't the marrying brand.<br>
But I wanted to speak o' your mother that's Lady Gloster still;<br>
I'm going to up and see her, without its hurting the will. <br>
Here! Take your hand off the bell-pull. Five thousand's waiting for you,<br>
If you'll only listen a minute, and do as I bid you do.<br>
They'll try to prove me crazy, and, if you bungle, they can;<br>
And I've only you to trust to! (O God, why ain't it a man?) <br>
There's some waste money on marbles, the same as M'Cullough tried - <br>
Marbles and mausoleums - but I call that sinful pride.<br>
There's some ship bodies for burial - we've carried 'em, soldered and packed,<br>
Down in their wills they wrote it, and nobody called <i>them</i> cracked.<br>
But me - I've too much money, and people might . . . All my fault:<br>
It come o' hoping for grandsons and buying that Wokin' vault... <br>
I'm sick o' the 'ole dam' business. I'm going back where I came.<br>
Dick, you're the son o' my body, and you'll take charge o' the same!<br>
I want to lie by your mother, ten thousand mile away,<br>
And they'll want to send me to Woking; and that's where you'll earn your pay.<br>
I've thought it out on the quiet, the same as it ought to be done - <br>
Quiet, and decent, and proper - an' here's your orders, my son.<br>
You know the Line? You don't, though. You write to the Board, and tell <br>
Your father's death has upset you an' you're going to cruise for a spell,<br>
An' you'd like the <I>Mary Gloster</I> - I've held her ready for this - <br>
They'll put her in working order and you'll take her out as she is.<br>
Yes, it was money idle when I patched her and laid her aside <br>
(Thank God, I can pay for my fancies!) - the boat where your mother died,<br>
By the Little Paternosters, as you come to the Union Bank,<br>
We dropped her - I think I told you - and I pricked it off where she sank.<br>
['Tiny she looked on the grating - that oily, treacly sea -]<br>
'Hundred and Eighteen East, remember, and South just Three. <br>
Easy bearings to carry - Three South-Three to the dot;<br>
But I gave McAndrew a copy in case of dying - or not.<br>
And so you'll write to McAndrew, he's Chief of the Maori Line <br>
They'Il give him leave, if you ask 'em and say it's business o' mine.<br>
I built three boats for the Maoris, an' very well pleased they were,<br>
An I've known Mac since the Fifties, and Mac knew me - and her.<br>
After the first stroke warned me I sent him the money to keep<br>
Against the time you'd claim it, committin' your dad to the deep;<br>
For you are the son o' my body, and Mac was my oldest friend,<br>
I've never asked 'im to dinner, but he'll see it out to the end.<br>
Stiff-necked Glasgow beggar! I've heard he's prayed for my soul,<br>
But he couldn't lie if you paid him, and he'd starve before he stole.<br>
He'll take the <I>Mary</I> in ballast - you'll find her a lively ship;<br>
And you'll take Sir Anthony Gloster, that goes on 'is wedding-trip,<br>
Lashed in our old deck-cabin with all three port-holes wide,<br>
The kick o' the screw beneath him and the round blue seas outside! <br>
Sir Anthony Gloster's carriage -  our 'ouse-flag flyin' free - <br>
Ten thousand men on the pay-roll and forty freighters at sea!<br>
He made himself and a million, but this world is a fleetin' show,<br>
And he'll go to the wife of 'is bosom the same as he ought to go - <br>
By the heel of the Paternosters - there isn't a chance to mistake - <br> 
And Mac'll pay you the money as soon as the bubbles break!<br>
Five thousand for six weeks' cruising, the staunchest freighter afloat,<br>
And Mac he'll give you your bonus the minute I'm out o' the boat!<br>
He'll take you round to Macassar, and you'll come back alone;<br>
He knows what I want o' the <I>Mary</I> . . . . I'll do what I please with my own. <br>
Your mother 'ud call it wasteful, but I've seven-and-thirty more;<br>
I'll come in my private carriage and bid it wait at the door... <br>
For my son 'e was never a credit: 'e muddled with books and art,<br>
And e' lived on Sir Anthony's money and 'e broke Sir Anthony's heart. <br>
There isn't even a grandchild, and the Gloster family's done - <br>
The only one you left me - O mother, the only one! <br>
Harrer and Trinity College -  me slavin' early an' late - <br>
An' he thinks I'm dying crazy, and you're in Macassar Strait! <br>
Flesh o' my flesh, my dearie, for ever an' ever amen,<br>
That first stroke come for a warning. I ought to ha' gone to you then.<br>
But - cheap repairs for a cheap 'un - the doctor said I'd do.<br>
Mary, why didn't you warn me? I've allus heeded to you,<br>
Excep' - I know - about women; but you are a spirit now;<br>
An', wife, they was only women, and I was a man. That's how.<br>
An' a man 'e must go with a woman, as you <I>could</I> not understand;<br>
But I never talked 'em secrets. I paid 'em out o' hand.<br>
Thank Gawd, I can pay for my fancies! Now what's five thousand to me,<br>
For a berth off the Paternosters in the haven where I would be?<br>
<I>I</I> believe in the Resurrection, if I read my Bible plain,<br>
But I wouldn't trust 'em at Wokin'; we're safer at sea again.<br>
For the heart it shall go with the treasure - go down to the sea in ships.<br>
I'm sick of the hired women. I'll kiss my girl on her lips!<br>
I'll be content with my fountain. I'll drink from my own well,<br>
And the wife of my youth shall charm me -  an' the rest can go to Hell!<br>
(Dickie, <I>he</I> will, that's certain.) I'll lie in our standin'-bed,<br>
An' Mac'll take her in ballast - an' she trims best by the head... <br>
Down by the head an' sinkin', her fires are drawn and cold,<br>
And the water's splashin' hollow on the skin of the empty hold - <br>
Churning an' choking and chuckling, quiet and scummy and dark - <br>
Full to her lower hatches and risin' steady. Hark!<br>
That was the after-bulkhead. . . . She's flooded from stem to stern...<br>
'Never seen death yet, Dickie? . . . Well, now is your time to learn! <br> <br>
