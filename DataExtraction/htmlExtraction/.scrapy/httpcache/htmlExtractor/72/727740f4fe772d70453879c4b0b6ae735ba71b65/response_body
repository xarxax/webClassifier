<i>(after he has been extemporizing upon the musical instrument of his invention)</i><P>
<dt><font size="+1">W</font>OULD that the structure brave, the manifold music I build,
<dt>Bidding my organ obey, calling its keys to their work,
<dt>Claiming each slave of the sound, at a touch, as when Solomon willed
<dt>Armies of angels that soar, legions of demons that lurk,
<dt>Man, brute, reptile, fly,---alien of end and of aim,
<dt>Adverse, each from the other heaven-high, hell-deep removed,---
<dt>Should rush into sight at once as he named the ineffable Name
<dt>And pile him a palace straight, to pleasure the princess he loved!
<P>
<dt>Would it might tarry like his, the beautiful building of mine,
<dt>This which my keys in a crowd pressed and importuned to raise!
<dt>Ah, one and all, how they helped, would dispart now and now combine,
<dt>Zealous to hasten the work, heighten their master his praise!
<dt>And one would bury his brow with a wild plunge down to hell,
<dt>Burrow awhile and build, broad on the roots of things,
<dt>Then up again swim into sight, having based me my palace well,
<dt>Founded it, fearless of flame, flat on the nether springs.
<P>
<dt>And another would mount and march, like the excellent minion he was,
<dt>Ay, another and yet another, one crowded but with many a crest,
<dt>Raising my rampired walls of gold as transparent as glass,
<dt>Eager to do and die, yield each his place to the rest:
<dt>For higher still and higher (as a runner tips with fire,
<dt>When a great illumination surprises a festal night ---
<dt>Outlined round and round Rome's dome from space to spire)
<dt>Up, the pinnacled glory reached, and the pride of my soul was in sight.
<P>
<dt>In sight? Not half! for it seemed, it was certain, to match man's birth,
<dt>Nature in turn conceived, obeying an impulse as I;
<dt>And the emulous heaven yearned down, made effort to reach the earth,
<dt>As the earth had done her best, in my passion, to scale the sky:
<dt>Novel splendours burst forth, grew familiar and dwelt with mine,
<dt>Not a point but found and fixed its wandering star;
<dt>Meteor-moons, balls of blaze: and they did not pale nor pine,
<dt>For earth had attained to heaven, there was no more near nor far.
<P>
<dt>Nay more; for there wanted not who walked in the glare and glow,
<dt>Presences plain in the place; or, fresh from the Protoplast,
<dt>Furnished for ages to come, when a kindlier wind should blow,
<dt>Lured now to begin and live, in a house to their liking at last;
<dt>Or else the wonderful Dead who have passed through the body and gone,
<dt>But were back once more to breathe in an old world worth their new:
<dt>What never had been, was now; what was, as it shall be anon;
<dt>And what is,--- shall I say, matched both? for I was made perfect too.
<P>
<dt>All through my keys that gave their sounds to a wish of my soul,
<dt>All through my soul that praised as its wish flowed visibly forth,
<dt>All through music and me! For think, had I painted the whole,
<dt>Why, there it had stood, to see, nor the process so wonder-worth:
<dt>Had I written the same, made verse---still, effect proceeds from cause,
<dt>Ye know why the forms are fair, ye hear how the tale is told;
<dt>It is all triumphant art, but art in obedience to laws,
<dt>Painter and poet are proud in the artist-list enrolled:---
<P>
<dt>But here is the finger of God, a flash of the will that can,
<dt>Existent behind all laws, that made them and, lo, they are!
<dt>And I know not if, save in this, such gift be allowed to man,
<dt>That out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star.
<dt>Consider it well: each tone of our scale in itself is nought;
<dt>It is everywhere in the world---loud, soft, and all is said:
<dt>Give it to me to use! I mix it with two in my thought:
<dt>And, there! Ye have heard and seen: consider and bow the head!
<P>
<dt>Well, it is gone at last, the palace of music I reared;
<dt>Gone! and the good tears start, the praises that come too slow;
<dt>For one is assured at first, one scarce can say that he feared,
<dt>That he even gave it a thought, the gone thing was to go.
<dt>Never to be again! But many more of the kind
<dt>As good, nay, better perchance: is this your comfort to me?
<dt>To me, who must be saved because I cling with my mind
<dt>To the same, same self, same God; ay, what was, shall be.
<P>
<dt>Therefore to whom turn I but to Thee, the ineffable Name?
<dt>Builder and maker, Thou, of houses not made with hands!
<dt>What, have fear of change from Thee who art ever the same?
<dt>Doubt that Thy power can fill the heart that Thy power expands?
<dt>There shall never be one lost good! What was, shall live as before;
<dt>The evil is null, is nought, is silence implying sound;
<dt>What was good shall be good, with, for evil, so much good more;
<dt>On the earth the broken arcs; in the heaven, a perfect round.
<P>
<dt>All we have willed or hoped or dreamed of good shall exist;
<dt>Not its semblance, but itself; no beauty, nor good, nor power
<dt>Whose voice has gone forth, but each survives for the melodist
<dt>When eternity affirms the conception of an hour.
<dt>The high that proved too high, the heroic for earth too hard,
<dt>The passion that left the ground to lose itself in the sky,
<dt>Are music sent up to God by the lover and the bard;
<dt>Enough that He heard it once: we shall hear it by-and-by.
<P>
<dt>And what is our failure here but a triumph's evidence
<dt>For the fulness of the days? Have we withered or agonized?
<dt>Why else was the pause prolonged but that singing might issue thence?
<dt>Why rushed the discords in but that harmony should be prized?
<dt>Sorrow is hard to bear, and doubt is slow to clear,
<dt>Each sufferer says his say, his scheme of the weal and woe:
<dt>But God has a few of us whom He whispers in the ear;
<dt>The rest may reason and welcome, 'tis we musicians know.
<P>
<dt>Well, it is earth with me; silence resumes her reign:
<dt>I will be patient and proud, and soberly acquiesce.
<dt>Give me the keys. I feel for the common chord again,
<dt>Sliding by semitones, till I sink to the minor,---yes,
<dt>And I blunt it into a ninth, and I stand on alien ground,
<dt>Surveying a while the heights I rolled from into the deep;
<dt>Which, hark, I have dared and done, for my resting-place is found,
<dt>The C major of this life: so, now I will try to sleep.

<dt><font size="+1">A</font>LL that I know
<dd>Of a certain star
<dt>Is, it can throw
<dd>(Like the angled spar)
<dt>Now a dart of red,
<dd>Now a dart of blue;
<dt>Till my friends have said
<dd>They would fain see, too,
<dt>My star that dartles the red and the blue!
<dt>Then it stops like a bird; like a flower hangs furled:
<dd>They must solace themselves with the Saturn above it.
<dt>What matter to me if their star is a world?
<dd>Mine has opened its soul to me, therefore I love it.

<dt><font size="+1">O</font>UT of your whole life give but a moment!
<dt>All of your life that has gone before,
<dt>All to come after it, -- so you ignore,
<dt>So you make perfect the present, -- condense,
<dt>In a rapture of rage, for perfection's endowement,
<dt>Thought and feeling and soul and sense --
<dt>Merged in a moment which give me at last
<dt>You around me for once, you beneath me, above me --
<dt>Me -- sure that despite of time future, time past, --
<dt>This tick of your life-time's one moment you love me!
<dt>How long such suspension may linger?  Ah, Sweet --
<dt>The moment eternal -- just that and no more --
<dt>When ecstasy's utmost we clutch at the core
<dt>While cheeks burn, arms open, eyes shut and lips meet!

<dt><font size="+1">F</font>EAR death?  -- to feel the fog in my throat,
<dd>  The mist in my face,
<dt>When the snows begin, and the blasts denote
<dd>  I am nearing the place,
<dt>The power of the night, the press of the storm,
<dd>  The post of the foe;
<dt>Where he stands, the Arch Fear in a visible form,
<dd>  Yet the strong man must go:
<dt>For the journey is done and the summit attained,
<dd>  And the barriers fall.
<dt>Tho' a battle's to fight ere the guerdon be gained,
<dd>  The reward of it all.
<dt>I was ever a fighter, so -- one fight more,
<dd>  The best and the last!
<dt>I would hate that death bandaged my eyes, and forebore,
<dd>  And bade me creep past.
<dt>No! let me taste the whole of it, fare like my peers
<dd>  The heroes of old,
<dt>Bear the brunt, in a minute pay glad life's arrears
<dd>  Of pain, darkness and cold.
<dt>For sudden the worst turns the best to the brave,
<dd>  The black minute's at end,
<dt>And the elements' rage, the friend-voices that rave,
<dd>  Shall dwindle, shall blend,
<dt>Shall change, shall become first a peace out of pain,
<dd>  Then a light, then thy breast,
<dt>O thou soul of my soul! I shall clasp thee again,
<dd>  And with God be the rest.

Incident of the French Camp</font></A></I></H2>
<UL><DL><P>
<dt><font size="+1">Y</font>OU know, we French stormed Ratisbon:
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  A mile or so away
<dt>On a little mound, Napoleon
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Stood on our storming-day;
<dt>With neck out-thrust, you fancy how,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Legs wide, arms locked behind,
<dt>As if to balance the prone brow
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Oppressive with its mind.<p>
<dt>Just as pehaps he mused,  "My plans
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  That soar, to earth may fall,
<dt>Let once my army-leader Lannes
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Waver a yonder wall," --
<dt>Out 'twixt the battery-smokes there flew
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  A rider, bound on bound
<dt>Full-galloping; nor bridle drew
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Until he reached the mound.<p>
<dt>Then off there flung in smiling joy,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  And held himself erect
<dt>By just his horse's mane, a boy:
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  You hardly could suspect --
<dt>(So tight he kept his lips compressed,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Scarce any blood came through)
<dt>You looked twice ere you saw his breast
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Was all but shot in two.<p>
<dt>"Well," cried he, "Emperor, by God's grace
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  We've got you Ratisbon!
<dt>The Marshal's in the market-place,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  And you'll be there anon
<dt>To see your flag-bird flap his vans
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Where I, to heart's desire,
<dt>Perched him!" The chief's eye flashed; his plans
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Soared up again like fire.<p>
<dt>The chief's eye flashed; but presently
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Softened itself, as sheathes
<dt>A film the mother-eagle's eye
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  When her bruised eaglet breathes:
<dt>"You're wounded!" "Nay", the soldier's pride
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Touched to quick, he said:
<dt>"I'm killed, Sire!" And his chief beside,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Smiling the boy fell dead.
