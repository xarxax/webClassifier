			There are many time that when we do a balance job the work piece wants to &quot;walk&quot; one way or the other. &nbsp;This could be seen after replacing the roller bearing if the edges of the bearing were not relieved properly. &nbsp;Another cause could just be the size of the piece. &nbsp;If the work piece is larger than what you are used to doing try a heavier weight oil, or even grease. &nbsp;Still not helping? &nbsp;Drop us a line, we&#39;re here to help!<br /><a href="http://dynamicsresearch.net/tips_and_tricks">Read more...</a>
