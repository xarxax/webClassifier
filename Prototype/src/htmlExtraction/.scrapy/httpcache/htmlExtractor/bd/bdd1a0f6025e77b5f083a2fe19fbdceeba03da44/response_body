        <BR>
        </I>I have come far enough<BR>
        from where I was not before<BR>
        to have seen the things<BR>
        looking in at me from through the open door<BR>
        <BR>
        and have walked tonight<BR>
        by myself<BR>
        to see the moonlight<BR>
        and see it as trees <BR>
        <BR>
        and shapes more fearful<BR>
        because I feared<BR>
        what I did not know<BR>
        but have wanted to know.<BR>
        <BR>
        My face is my own, I thought.<BR>
        But you have seen it<BR>
        turn into a thousand years.<BR>
        I watched you cry. <BR>
        <BR>
        I could not touch you.<BR>
        I wanted very much to<BR>
        touch you<BR>
        but could not.<BR>
        <BR>
        If it is dark<BR>
        when this is given to you,<BR>
        have care for its content<BR>
        when the moon shines. <BR>
        <BR>
        My face is my own.<BR>
        My hands are my own.<BR>
        My mouth is my own<BR>
        but I am not. <BR>
        <BR>
        Moon, moon,<BR>
        when you leave me alone<BR>
        all the darkness is<BR>
        an utter blackness, <BR>
        <BR>
        a pit of fear,<BR>
        a stench,<BR>
        hands unreasonable<BR>
        never to touch.<BR>
        <BR>
        But I love you.<BR>
        Do you love me.<BR>
        What to say<BR>
        when you see me. <BR>
