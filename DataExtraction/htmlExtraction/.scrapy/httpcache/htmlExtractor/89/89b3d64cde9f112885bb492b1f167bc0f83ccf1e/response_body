<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">An old adage claims that laughter is the
best medicine to cure human ailments.&nbsp; Although this treatment might
sound somewhat unorthodox, its value as a remedy can be traced back to
ancient times when Hypocrites, in his medical treatise, stressed the importance
of&nbsp; “a gay and cheerful mood on the part of the physician and patient
fighting disease” (Bakhtin 67).&nbsp; Aristotle viewed laughter as man’s
quintessential privilege:&nbsp; “Of all living creatures only man is endowed
with laughter” (Bakhtin 68).&nbsp; In the Middle Ages, laughter was an
integral part of folk culture.&nbsp; “Carnival festivities and the comic
spectacles and ritual connected with them had an important place in the
life of medieval man” (Bakhtin 5).&nbsp; During the trauma and devastation
of German bombing raids on London during World War II, the stubborn resilience
of British humor emerged to sustain the spirit of the people and the courage
of the nation.&nbsp; To laugh, even in the face of death, is a compelling
force in the human condition.&nbsp; Humor, then, has a profound impact
on the way human beings experience life.&nbsp; In Louise Erdrich’s novel
<I>Tracks</I>, humor provides powerful medicine as the Chippewa tribe struggles
for their physical, spiritual, and cultural survival at the beginning of
the twentieth century.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">While the ability to approach life with
a sense of humor is not unique to any one society, it is an intrinsic quality
of Native American life.&nbsp; “There is, and always has been, humor among
Indians . . . ” (Lincoln 22).&nbsp;&nbsp; In deference to their history,
this can best be described as survival humor, one which “transcends the
void, questions fatalism, and outlasts suffering” (Lincoln 45).&nbsp; Through
their capacity to draw common strength from shared humor, Native Americans
demonstrate how “kinship interconnects comically . . . . [in] a kind of
personal tribalism that begins with two people, configurates around families,
composes itself in extended kin and clan, and ends up defining a culture”
(Lincoln 63).&nbsp; In <I>Tracks</I>, the power of Native American humor
to profoundly affect human experience is portrayed through the characters
of Nanapush and Fleur.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">In his role as “Nanabush” the trickster,
a central figure in Chippewa (Ojibwa) storytelling, Nanapush demonstrates
the power of Native American humor in his own life, when he challenges
the gods and cheats death by playing a trick on them:&nbsp; “During the
year of the sickness, when I was the last one left, I saved myself by starting
a story . . . . I got well by talking.&nbsp; Death could not get a word
in edgewise, grew discouraged, and traveled on” (Erdrich 46).&nbsp; The
trickster figure is characterized as a man of many guises, dualistic in
nature—good and bad—and often considered quite a lover.&nbsp; He is a survivor,
physically and psychologically.&nbsp; As one who endures, he transcends
the temporal and functions as an affirmation of the self.&nbsp; The trickster
is also “central to the tribe’s worldview,” with power that extends beyond
himself, guiding his people toward a view of themselves and of <I>possibility</I>
that they might not have seen otherwise (Ghezzi 444).&nbsp; To fulfill
his role as trickster, Nanapush uses humor as powerful medicine not only
for himself, but also for his tribe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Nanapush purposefully directs his own special
brand of humor—raucous bantering—at&nbsp; Margaret, guiding her away from
her hardened widow-view of life toward the possibility of a romantic relationship
with him.&nbsp; He goads her by boasting of his sexual prowess, to which
she is less than receptive.&nbsp; Nanapush describes her as “headlong,
bossy, scared of nobody and full of vinegar” (Erdrich 47), while she calls
him an “old man . . . . [with] two wrinkled berries and a twig.”&nbsp;
When he replies, “A twig can grow,” Margaret retorts, “But only in the
spring” (Erdrich 48).&nbsp; Through humor, each comes to view the other
with new <I>possibility</I>.&nbsp; Out of their bantering evolves a deeper,
more meaningful relationship, one that binds them together in strength,
companionship, and love.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Through a more subtle, gentle humor, Nanapush
guides Eli Kashpaw, who is like a son, toward a successful romantic union
with Fleur Pillager, a union that is both an uninhibited&nbsp; celebration
of life between two lovers and a symbol of hope for the people of their
tribe.&nbsp; When Eli pleads for advice on how to woo Fleur, Nanapush imparts
the humorous wisdom of a man who has had three wives:&nbsp; “I told him
what he wanted to know.&nbsp; He asked me the old-time way to make a woman
love him and I went into detail so he should make no disgraceful error”
(Erdrich 45).&nbsp; He also gave him “a few things from the French trunk
my third wife left . . . ” to help him in the courting process (Erdrich
45).&nbsp; Nanapush is pleased when he hears nothing more from Eli after
he returns to Fleur, interpreting this “as a sign she [Fleur] liked the
fan, the bead leggings, and maybe the rest of Eli, the part where he was
on his own” (Erdrich 46).&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">A powerful, sensuous relationship develops
between Eli and Fleur that provides solace to themselves and inspiration
to their tribe during a bitter winter, when there was no food and little
hope, and the people of the tribe chopped holes in Lake Matchimanito to
fish.&nbsp; They&nbsp; “stood on the ice for hours, waiting, slapping themselves,
with nothing to occupy them but their hunger and their children’s hunger”
(Erdrich 130).&nbsp; From Fleur’s cabin across the frozen lake, the people
could hear faint calls “uncontained by the thick walls of the cabin.&nbsp;
These cries were full of pleasure, strange and wonderful to hear, sweet
as the taste of last summer’s fruit.&nbsp; Bundled in strips of blanket,
coats stuffed with leaves and straw,” they pushed the scarves away from
their ears to hear the sounds of pleasure that “carried so well through
the hollow air, even laughing whispers . . .” Erdrich 130).&nbsp;&nbsp;
The people listened “until they heard the satisfaction of silence.&nbsp;
Then they turned away and crept back with hope.&nbsp; Faintly warmed, they
leaned down to gather in their icy line.” (Erdrich 130).&nbsp; The celebration
of life between two lovers, born from the humorous wisdom of Nanapush in
his advice to Eli, was transferred to the tribe as spiritual nourishment
and the possibility of hope.&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Nanapush unleashes an unmerciful humor
on Pauline, the tragic, self-tortured figure torn between her Chippewa
heritage and her desire to reject it, in order to guide her away from her
path toward self-destruction.&nbsp; Through his role as trickster, Nanapush
tries to force Pauline toward a new view of herself, one that will end
her persistent practice of self-mortification in rejection of her heritage
and return her to her place within the tribe.&nbsp; “[W]hen Pauline has
limited herself to urinating only twice a day, Nanapush tells a ribald
story, fills her with tea, and tricks her into using the outhouse before
she is supposed to” (Towery 104).&nbsp; Sadly, Nanapush’s attempt at survivalist
humor, which can steer “a neurotic from the shoals of self-torment,” fails
with Pauline, who chooses instead a path that leads her away from the kinship
of the tribe, as well as from the humor that could heal and save her (Lincoln
166).&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Through Fleur, Erdrich epitomizes the power
of Native American humor to ridicule fate and to transcend sorrow.&nbsp;
When Fleur learns that she has lost her land to a logging company, she
devises a plan that allows her to “[alchemize] her suffering toward ironic
perception and comic possibility” (Lincoln 166).&nbsp; She will have the
last, ironic laugh.&nbsp;&nbsp; If her beloved trees must fall, she will
not let them be felled by white men’s hands.&nbsp; During the months that
mark the logging company’s march of destruction through the forest toward
her cabin, Fleur uses a stolen axe and a stolen saw to cut almost, but
not completely, through the bases of the last remaining stand of trees
surrounding her cabin.&nbsp; When the loggers finally arrive at her doorstep,
she is ready for them.&nbsp; Fleur has alchemized her suffering toward
an act of defiance that will give her the strength she will need to transcend
the sorrow of her loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">A strong sense of uneasiness and foreboding
drives Nanapush to Fleur’s cabin.&nbsp; As he passes through the desecrated
remnants of the woods, he sees that all that remains is “the square mile
of towering oaks, a circle around Fleur’s cabin” (Erdrich 220).&nbsp; When
he reaches her cabin, Fleur is standing at the front door, surrounded by
wagons and logging men, “waiting for the signal, for the word, to take
down the last of the trees.”&nbsp; Nanapush expects to see sorrow and defeat
on Fleur’s face, but “[h]er face was warm with excitement and her look
was chilling in its clear amusement.&nbsp; She said nothing, just glanced
into the sky and let her eyes drop shut,” drawing silent strength from
the ironic triumph of her secret (Erdrich 222).&nbsp; Nanapush realizes
what Fleur has done when “along the edge of the last high woods, a low
breeze moaned out of the stumps” and he hears the sound of the first tree
crashing down beyond his sight (Erdrich 222).&nbsp; As other trees fall,
closer and closer to where the loggers are standing, Fleur has “bared her
teeth in a wide smile that frightened even those who did not understand
the smiles of Pillagers” (Erdrich 223).&nbsp; A final gust of wind topples
the remaining trees, and they fall away from her cabin “in a circle, pinning
beneath their branches the roaring men, the horses . . . Twigs formed webs
of wood, canopies laced over groans and struggles.&nbsp; Then the wind
settled, curled back into the clouds, moved on” (Erdrich 223).&nbsp; In
the quiet shock of the aftermath, Nanapush and Fleur “were left standing
together in a landscape level to the lake and to the road” (Erdrich 223).&nbsp;
Although Nanapush urges Fleur to remain with the tribe, she rejects his
offer.&nbsp; “[W]ith her face alight,” she buckles herself to a small cart
that holds no possessions, “only weed-wrapped stones from the lake-bottom,
bundles of roots, a coil of rags, and the umbrella that had shaded her
[dead] baby,” and sets out alone (Erdrich 224).&nbsp; No force is powerful
enough to reconcile the desecration of her land, but through her ironic
act of defiance, Fleur has drawn the strength she will need to survive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">In Louise Erdrich’s <I>Tracks</I>, Native
American humor challenges fate, nourishes the human spirit, and gives strength
and hope for survival.&nbsp; “The powers to heal and to hurt, to bond and
to exorcise, to renew and to purge remain the contrary powers of Indian
humor” (Lincoln 5).&nbsp; For the Chippewa, this humor provides powerful
medicine for the physical, cultural, and spiritual preservation of their
tribe.&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;
