<p>7/25/2007: CHEYENNE - The ties between Cheyenne Frontier Days and popular country musician and former bareback rider Chris LeDoux became even more tightly knotted Tuesday.

<p>Not long after dismounting bareback horse Bear Sign, Beau LeDoux reached into his shirt pocket, pulled out a small bag of his father's ashes and poured them on the arena floor.

<p>The plan had been in the works for two years, but the 24-year-old had been injured and unable to compete in the past two CFD rodeos. LeDoux posted an 81-point ride Tuesday to tie for third in the second go-round. He recorded a 70 on Monday.

<p>It was something my family and I thought would be right to do because this was such a special rodeo to him," Beau LeDoux said. "This has always been a special rodeo in my family. My dad rode here and came close to winning here a couple of times. -- <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wyomingnews.com/articles/2007/07/25/sports/19sports_07-25-07.txt"><small>Wyoming News</small></a>

<P>4/2006: I am so saddened by the loss of Chris LeDoux that even a year later, I find it hard
	to write anything here.  I am just a fan and only met him briefly after a couple of his concerts,
	but I felt like I knew him from listening to his music, going to his concerts,
	spending so much time on this site reading all of the wonderful stories you all have written here.
	All the stories that have ever been left about him are such positive, wonderful tributes to a
	wonderful cowboy gentleman who enriched all of our lives with his example and his music.
	Thank you all for continuing to enter your stories here about Chris.
	God Bless Chris's family, friends, and fans.  --Janet

  <p>&quot;When he blasts onto a stage, it's with the same furious tension as
    when the chutes used to open for him on a bucking bronc. When he writes songs,
    he writes and sings about cowboys, rodeos, and wide open spaces. He writes
    about dusty cowboy hats, worn-out boots, wild horses, lonesome roads, and
    storm clouds above the timber line. His music is about a world many have only
    seen in movies and others believe lost to history. He writes about what he
    knows. He's the real thing, a world champion rodeo rider and a world class
    entertainer.&quot; <font size="1"><i><a href="cl_disc.htm">1994 American Cowboy Collection</a></i></font></p>

  I love to smell the sage in bloom<br>

  Just turn 'em loose in the western summer time...</p>

      <b>Chris read your stories</b><br>
      Hello folks I just thought that you'd all like to know that Bobby Jensen (Chris's keyboard
      player) printed out all of your messages and brought them onto the Bus for us all to read.
      Chris read every one of them and was suprised at your reaction to him. He said that
      sometimes it's really easy to get caught up in our own little world on the road and that
      it was nice to know that people really still do enjoy the show. Keep up the postings and
      those of us into the computer will see to it that Chris gets your messages. Lonesome Bill
      (Chris's fiddle player)&nbsp; - <b>Lonesome Bill</b> posted this on Fri Mar 06, 1998<p>

      <P>Janet, I continue to bring Chris copies of the stories people post on
this site. He and the band love to read it. I gave him the latest at
the Grand National Rodeo in S.F. and will bring him the new ones at the
NFR in Vegas. Just thought I would let you know. Keep up the good work
for Chris, he appreciates it.  <b>Rob Fair</b> <small>(email from several years ago)</small>

    <i>Gold Buckle Dreams - The Rodeo Life of Chris LeDoux</i></a><br>
  By David G. Brown
</font>
</td>
<td valign="top" align="left">
       <font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial" size=2>

      This book is by David Brown as told to him by Chris LeDoux. It starts when Chris was a
      child learning to ride horses and living in Texas, later moving to Cheyenne as a teenager,
      and follows his life through attainment of his dream of becoming a World Champion bareback
      bronc rider. It was written before he became world famous for his musical talent but
      describes the beginnings of his musical career as well.<p>Chris describes one special
      memory of standing in the empty, quiet arena at Cheyenne Frontier Park as a teenager
      dreaming of being able to ride in the Frontier Days Rodeo. I can just feel the emptiness
      of the big arena and hear the Wyoming wind whistling through it. When Chris performs in
      Cheyenne, it is always very special to him. With all that Chris has attained since this
      book was written, there is definitely a need for a sequel.
      </p>
      <p>If you are a Chris LeDoux fan, this is a &quot;must read!&quot;
