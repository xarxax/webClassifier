          <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">1. Cogida and death <BR>
            <BR>
            At five in the afternoon. <BR>
            It was exactly five in the afternoon. <BR>
            A boy brought the white sheet <BR>
            at five in the afternoon. <BR>
            A frail of lime ready prepared <BR>
            at five in the afternoon. <BR>
            The rest was death, and death alone. <BR>
            <BR>
            The wind carried away the cottonwool <BR>
            at five in the afternoon. <BR>
            And the oxide scattered crystal and nickel <BR>
            at five in the afternoon. <BR>
            Now the dove and the leopard wrestle <BR>
            at five in the afternoon. <BR>
            And a thigh with a desolated horn <BR>
            at five in the afternoon. <BR>
            The bass-string struck up <BR>
            at five in the afternoon. <BR>
            Arsenic bells and smoke <BR>
            at five in the afternoon. <BR>
            Groups of silence in the corners <BR>
            at five in the afternoon. <BR>
            And the bull alone with a high heart! <BR>
            At five in the afternoon. <BR>
            When the sweat of snow was coming <BR>
            at five in the afternoon, <BR>
            when the bull ring was covered with iodine <BR>
            at five in the afternoon. <BR>
            Death laid eggs in the wound <BR>
            at five in the afternoon. <BR>
            At five in the afternoon. <BR>
            At five o'clock in the afternoon. <BR>
            <BR>
            A coffin on wheels is his bed <BR>
            at five in the afternoon. <BR>
            Bones and flutes resound in his ears <BR>
            at five in the afternoon. <BR>
            Now the bull was bellowing through his forehead <BR>
            at five in the afternoon. <BR>
            The room was iridiscent with agony <BR>
            at five in the afternoon. <BR>
            In the distance the gangrene now comes <BR>
            at five in the afternoon. <BR>
            Horn of the lily through green groins <BR>
            at five in the afternoon. <BR>
            The wounds were burning like suns <BR>
            at five in the afternoon. <BR>
            At five in the afternoon. <BR>
            Ah, that fatal five in the afternoon! <BR>
            It was five by all the clocks! <BR>
            It was five in the shade of the afternoon! <BR>
            <BR>
            <BR>
            <BR>
            2. The Spilled Blood <BR>
            <BR>
            I will not see it! <BR>
            <BR>
            Tell the moon to come, <BR>
            for I do not want to see the blood <BR>
            of Ignacio on the sand. <BR>
            <BR>
            I will not see it! <BR>
            <BR>
            The moon wide open. <BR>
            Horse of still clouds, <BR>
            and the grey bull ring of dreams <BR>
            with willows in the barreras. <BR>
            <BR>
            I will not see it! <BR>
            <BR>
            Let my memory kindle! <BR>
            Warm the jasmines <BR>
            of such minute whiteness! <BR>
            <BR>
            I will not see it! <BR>
            <BR>
            The cow of the ancient world <BR>
            passed har sad tongue <BR>
            over a snout of blood <BR>
            spilled on the sand, <BR>
            and the bulls of Guisando, <BR>
            partly death and partly stone, <BR>
            bellowed like two centuries <BR>
            sated with threading the earth. <BR>
            No. <BR>
            I will not see it! <BR>
            <BR>
            Ignacio goes up the tiers <BR>
            with all his death on his shoulders. <BR>
            He sought for the dawn <BR>
            but the dawn was no more. <BR>
            He seeks for his confident profile <BR>
            and the dream bewilders him <BR>
            He sought for his beautiful body <BR>
            and encountered his opened blood <BR>
            Do not ask me to see it! <BR>
            I do not want to hear it spurt <BR>
            each time with less strength: <BR>
            that spurt that illuminates <BR>
            the tiers of seats, and spills <BR>
            over the cordury and the leather <BR>
            of a thirsty multiude. <BR>
            Who shouts that I should come near! <BR>
            Do not ask me to see it! <BR>
            <BR>
            His eyes did not close <BR>
            when he saw the horns near, <BR>
            but the terrible mothers <BR>
            lifted their heads. <BR>
            And across the ranches, <BR>
            an air of secret voices rose, <BR>
            shouting to celestial bulls, <BR>
            herdsmen of pale mist. <BR>
            There was no prince in Sevilla <BR>
            who could compare to him, <BR>
            nor sword like his sword <BR>
            nor heart so true. <BR>
            Like a river of lions <BR>
            was his marvellous strength, <BR>
            and like a marble toroso <BR>
            his firm drawn moderation. <BR>
            The air of Andalusian Rome <BR>
            gilded his head <BR>
            where his smile was a spikenard <BR>
            of wit and intelligence. <BR>
            What a great torero in the ring! <BR>
            What a good peasant in the sierra! <BR>
            How gentle with the sheaves! <BR>
            How hard with the spurs! <BR>
            How tender with the dew! <BR>
            How dazzling the fiesta! <BR>
            How tremendous with the final <BR>
            banderillas of darkness! <BR>
            <BR>
            But now he sleeps without end. <BR>
            Now the moss and the grass <BR>
            open with sure fingers <BR>
            the flower of his skull. <BR>
            And now his blood comes out singing; <BR>
            singing along marshes and meadows, <BR>
            sliden on frozen horns, <BR>
            faltering soulles in the mist <BR>
            stoumbling over a thousand hoofs <BR>
            like a long, dark, sad tongue, <BR>
            to form a pool of agony <BR>
            close to the starry Guadalquivir. <BR>
            Oh, white wall of Spain! <BR>
            Oh, black bull of sorrow! <BR>
            Oh, hard blood of Ignacio! <BR>
            Oh, nightingale of his veins! <BR>
            No. <BR>
            I will not see it! <BR>
            No chalice can contain it, <BR>
            no swallows can drink it, <BR>
            no frost of light can cool it, <BR>
            nor song nor deluge og white lilies, <BR>
            no glass can cover mit with silver. <BR>
            No. <BR>
            I will not see it! <BR>
            <BR>
            <BR>
            <BR>
            3. The Laid Out Body <BR>
            <BR>
            Stone is a forehead where dreames grieve <BR>
            without curving waters and frozen cypresses. <BR>
            Stone is a shoulder on which to bear Time <BR>
            with trees formed of tears and ribbons and planets. <BR>
            <BR>
            I have seen grey showers move towards the waves <BR>
            raising their tender riddle arms, <BR>
            to avoid being caught by lying stone <BR>
            which loosens their limbs without soaking their blood. <BR>
            <BR>
            For stone gathers seed and clouds, <BR>
            skeleton larks and wolves of penumbra: <BR>
            but yields not sounds nor crystals nor fire, <BR>
            only bull rings and bull rings and more bull rings without walls. 
            <BR>
            <BR>
            Now, Ignacio the well born lies on the stone. <BR>
            All is finished. What is happening! Contemplate his face: <BR>
            death has covered him with pale sulphur <BR>
            and has place on him the head of dark minotaur. <BR>
            <BR>
            All is finished. The rain penetrates his mouth. <BR>
            The air, as if mad, leaves his sunken chest, <BR>
            and Love, soaked through with tears of snow, <BR>
            warms itself on the peak of the herd. <BR>
            <BR>
            What is they saying? A stenching silence settles down. <BR>
            We are here with a body laid out which fades away, <BR>
            with a pure shape which had nightingales <BR>
            and we see it being filled with depthless holes. <BR>
            <BR>
            Who creases the shroud? What he says is not true! <BR>
            Nobody sings here, nobody weeps in the corner, <BR>
            nobody pricks the spurs, nor terrifies the serpent. <BR>
            Here I want nothing else but the round eyes <BR>
            to see his body without a chance of rest. <BR>
            <BR>
            Here I want to see those men of hard voice. <BR>
            Those that break horses and dominate rivers; <BR>
            those men of sonorous skeleton who sing <BR>
            with a mouth full of sun and flint. <BR>
            <BR>
            Here I want to see them. Before the stone. <BR>
            Before this body with broken reins. <BR>
            I want to know from them the way out <BR>
            for this captain stripped down by death. <BR>
            <BR>
            I want them to show me a lament like a river <BR>
            wich will have sweet mists and deep shores, <BR>
            to take the body of Ignacio where it looses itself <BR>
            without hearing the double planting of the bulls. <BR>
            <BR>
            Loses itself in the round bull ring of the moon <BR>
            which feigns in its youth a sad quiet bull, <BR>
            loses itself in the night without song of fishes <BR>
            and in the white thicket of frozen smoke. <BR>
            <BR>
            I don't want to cover his face with handkerchiefs <BR>
            that he may get used to the death he carries. <BR>
            Go, Ignacio, feel not the hot bellowing <BR>
            Sleep, fly, rest: even the sea dies! <BR>
            <BR>
            <BR>
            <BR>
            4. Absent Soul <BR>
            <BR>
            The bull does not know you, nor the fig tree, <BR>
            nor the horses, nor the ants in your own house. <BR>
            The child and the afternoon do not know you <BR>
            because you have dead forever. <BR>
            <BR>
            The shoulder of the stone does not know you <BR>
            nor the black silk, where you are shuttered. <BR>
            Your silent memory does not know you <BR>
            because you have died forever <BR>
            <BR>
            The autumn will come with small white snails, <BR>
            misty grapes and clustered hills, <BR>
            but no one will look into your eyes <BR>
            because you have died forever. <BR>
            <BR>
            Because you have died for ever, <BR>
            like all the dead of the earth, <BR>
            like all the dead who are forgotten <BR>
            in a heap of lifeless dogs. <BR>
            <BR>
            Nobady knows you. No. But I sing of you. <BR>
            For posterity I sing of your profile and grace. <BR>
            Of the signal maturity of your understanding. <BR>
            Of your appetite for death and the taste of its mouth. <BR>
            Of the sadness of your once valiant gaiety. <BR>
            <BR>
            It will be a long time, if ever, before there is born <BR>
            an Andalusian so true, so rich in adventure. <BR>
            I sing of his elegance with words that groan, <BR>
            and I remember a sad breeze through the olive trees.<B> </B></FONT></P>
