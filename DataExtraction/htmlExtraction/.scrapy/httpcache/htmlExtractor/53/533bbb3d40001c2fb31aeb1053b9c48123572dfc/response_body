<p style="text-align:left;">Neem's action maximises the natural immune system and can selectively wipe out invading microbes without adversely affecting other cells. Pharmaceutical products can contain toxic chemicals powerful enough to eliminate all microbes, but often also harm healthy body tissue and may cause undesirable side effects.</p> 
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Neem has no known side effects.</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Makes 500ml.</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">Melt a pot of Ekoneem oil in tepid water until it becomes liquid. Add 1x5ml teaspoon of Ekoneem oil to a 500ml (1/2 litre) of water with a squirt of baby shampoo. Shake or stir vigourously. Apply with a clean plant spray bottle.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">NB: Ekoneem oil deteriorates in water therefore only make up the amount needed for each day.</p>

                  it has worked really well with Belle our Cocker Spanial. Belle has 
                  an adverse reaction - to what we do not know - but regularly gets 
                  small spots which turn flaky and scabby and take ages to go. Since 
                  we have had Ekoneem neem oil, which we have applied to the affected areas, 
                  it soothed the irritation allowing her to heal naturally within 
                  a week.&quot; F.A. Watson - Dorset.</p>

                  I'm happy to say the oil &quot;Ekoneem&quot; has had a very marked 
                  effect after only 3 days use. The scaly type scurf has disappeared 
                  and the scratching has virtually stopped. I have already recommended 
                  it to other dog owners who's pets have long term skin 
                  irritations. Yours sincerely&quot;</p>

                <p class="slideouttext">&quot;Dear Mrs Thomson,<br>
                  ...There was no immediate improvement noticed on my bitch's scratched 
                  coat, but after about four days it became obvious, then rapid improvement 
                  took place enabling her to be shown at LKA less than three weeks 
                  later.<br>
                  I used about half the pot rubbing it in twice a day, morning and 
                  evening. It was quite acceptable to the bitch who made no attempt 
                  to scratch or lick it off.<br>
                  I have therefore no hesitation in recommending EKONEEM as I have 
                  mention in my &quot;Dog World&quot; Beagle Breed Notes. Thank you 
                  for your help.&quot; - David Webster.</p>

                <p class="slideouttext">&quot;Dear Mrs Thomson,<br>
                  Re: Purdey - Pointer bitch - 4&frac12; years old.<br>
                  Thank you for supplying Ekoneem. Our pointer has a 
                  very bad itchy patch on her face which she scratched raw. Various 
                  other remedies cleared the area temporarily, but within a few days 
                  Purdey started to scratch the area and it broke out again.<br>
                  Then we received your Ekoneem, we have used this twice daily for 
                  2 weeks and then once a day at night. We cannot believe the result, 
                  Purdey's hair is growing back and she has stopped scratching. We 
                  are so grateful we have told our &quot;doggie&quot; friends and 
                  have given them copies of your leaflets, enclosed sae would you 
                  kindly send some of your leaflets to pass around. Many thanks.&quot;

                <p class="slideouttext">Our Jack Russell had an itchy 
                  rash on his tummy on which nothing had any effect. Ekoneem stopped 
                  the itching overnight, the rash has gone and now the hair is growing 
                  back.<br>

                <p class="slideouttext">My 7 year old Irish Water Spaniel 
                  had a persistent bald patch about the size of a two pence piece 
                  under one eye, which nothing would clear. Ekoneem neem oil cleared it within 
                  14 days. My sister's dog had a very sore wet patch on his back for 
                  which various remedies had no appreciable effect. Again Ekoneem 
                  came to the rescue - it soothed the irritation allowing the her 
                  to heal naturally and the hair is re-growing all within 14 days.<br>

                <p class="slideouttext">I have just had a grateful call from Jacqueling 
                  Brandish of the Corramundi Bull Terriers in North Wales. Her four-year-old 
                  mahogany brindle bitch began having sore feet about 18 months 
                  ago, since when she has had increasingly sore feet. Jacqie says 
                  she was at her wit's end to know how to ease her beloved bitch's 
                  discomfort.<br>
                  She said she read about how well Ekoneem had worked in my column 
                  and rang for some, which arrived by the next post. Wihin just 12 
                  hours of the first application, Pepper had stopped biting herself 
                  and the skin on her feet had turned from bright red to a normal 
                  healthy colour. Jacqueline is so grateful to have her own happy, 
                  playful bitch back once more. <br>

                  <p class="slideouttext">&quot;Recently I developed itchy patches on my scalp underneath my hair, also on my legs below my knees and on my hips.  I didn't think much of it at first and got used to a little scratching every day, but it persisted and slowly got worse, probably exacerbated by the scratching.<br>
                  I use Ekoneem neem oil as a cure-all for my horses, applying it as an antiseptic disinfectant to any wounds that happen.  These wounds seem to clear up very quickly and the hair re-growth is remarkably quick.<br>
                  I decided to try it on myself to alleviate the itching.  I started washing my hair with Ekoneem soap which contains neem oil, and the results were immediate.  The itching stopped almost completely.  I uses Ekoneem neem oil on my legs after showering and this kept the itching at bay.  Although the itching on my legs was a little more persistant, after about two weeks of regular washing with Ekoneem soap and then applying the neem oil, the itching stopped completely and the red blotchy patches disappeared. Go to a doctor for skin problems and likely you'll get steroid cream and antihistermin, both drugs with appalling side affects, and I can say from first hand experience that they do not work.  The skin problems always return.   So, I would recommend Ekoneem to anyone who has persistent skin problems because it worked for me.<br>
                Three years ago my horse developed a small sarcoid on her teat about the size of a golf ball two thirds of which was below the surface.  I used Ekoneem oil twice a day for many months and it successfully reduced the size of the sarcoid to about half an inch in diameter.  The truth is that it never got rid of the sarcoid completely but it was clearly helping.  Truely remarkable stuff&quot;. Mark Carter</p>
