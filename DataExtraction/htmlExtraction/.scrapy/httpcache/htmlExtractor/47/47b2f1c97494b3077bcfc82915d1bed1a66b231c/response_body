Daniel Keyes is best known for &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;, which won a 1960 Hugo for its original novelette version. It was expanded to the novel <b>Flowers for Algernon</b> (1966) and in that form tied for the Nebula Award in 1967. Later works include the quasi-SF thriller <b>The Touch</b> (1968; UK 1977 as <b>The Contaminated Man</b>), and <b>The Fifth Sally</b> (1980). Nonfiction works include <b>The Minds of Billy Milligan</b> (1982), a sequel to which has appeared in Japan as <b>The Milligan Wars: A True-Story Sequel</b> (1994). The sequel will be published in the US by Bantam when the film version of the first book appears from Warner, as <b>The Crowded Room</b>.

"<b>Flowers for Algernon</b> has been published in about 30 countries, and each year I'm getting new foreign translations, and deals for reprints. [It] is still in print in both hardcover and paperback, and studied in high schools all across the country. The story, the novel, the movie <b><i>Charly</i></b> got the Academy Award for Cliff Robertson. In the '70s, when it was made into a musical in London and on Broadway, they tried to change the ending -- nobody has ever been able to change that ending, and I'm happy for that!"
<p>
"...So I wrote the story. I called Horace Gold, and he said, 'Bring it over. I'll read it while you're here. Have a cup of coffee, read a magazine.' Horace was an agoraphobic who ran poker games Friday night to Saturday dawn in his First Avenue apartment, and his office for <i>Galaxy</i> was there too. I was kind of nervous, because Horace was an important editor, and that was only my fifth short story I was submitting for publication. Horace came in from the other room and said, 'Dan, this is a good story, but I'm gonna tell you how to make it a <i>great</i> story: Charlie does not lose his intelligence; he remains a super-genius, and he and Alice fall in love, they get married, and live happily ever after.'..."
<p>
"...I finished the novel for Doubleday, but they wanted the ending changed. I said, 'No, We'll give them back their advance.' It was rejected by five publishers over the period of a year. I was suffering, becuase I wanted the book published! But finally it appeared, and <b>Flowers for Algernon</b> has never gone out of print since..."
<p>
"...In both Japan and Germany, all my books have been published and never gone out of print. ...When I went to Tokyo, they drove me past the department store where I was going to go for signings. The line was wrapped around the block three times! They brought me gifts, flowers, candy, letters, and I sat there thinking, 'I feel like a rock star.'..."
