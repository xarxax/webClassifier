      		<p><span class="style2"><strong>Welcome</strong></span> to Medical Technology Research, where we are <b><i>
      		   Making Health Care Better<sup><span class="style1">tm</span></sup></i></b></p>

            <p>The cost of delivering medical services seems to be spiraling
                out of control. And now, more than ever, people are focused on errors and
                inaccuracies that have plagued the medical industry. MTRC 
			focuses on two classes of clients to improve the use of technology 
			in medicine. One of our focuses is with the medical technology 
			developer.&nbsp; MTRC takes its decades of experience in technology 
			and clinical experience and combines that to improve the products 
			being developed for the medical market. The other focus is with the 
			end users of the medical products. MTRC uses its intimate product 
			knowledge and relationships with these manufacturers to help the 
			clinical user obtain the most out of their technology investments. Take a look at our
                <a href="services/services.htm">services</a> and see how
                <a href="about/about.htm">Medical Technology Research</a>
                can work with you to help improve your products and help those 
			in industry adopt their use.</p>

            <h2>Wireless is Freedom and Productivity</h2>

            <p>Today, the practice, clinic, and hospital must have all the
                latest connectivity and electronic equipment to remain competitive.&nbsp;
                Everyone from office staff to doctors, nurses, and clinicians must have secure
                real-time access to information, patient records, drug databases, and other
                things at all times.</p>

            <p>Practitioners and their staff need everything from telemetry systems,
                wireless local-area networks (WLANs) to wide-area enabled cell phones and Blackberries.</p>
            
            <p>If your wireless technologies don&#39;t appear to be delivering what 
		   	   you expect, contact us to provide you with a site and spectral 
			   analysis. We&#39;ll be able to tell you what is operating in each 
			   of the various radio bands within your facility. There are 
			   many products available today to help you manage your bandwidth and 
			   increase your wireless reliability as well as your security.</p>
			   
			<p>In addition to a reliable technology infrastructure, there are a number of
			   security best practices and products available today 
               that enable you to secure your information and infrastructure. Together, 
               we can combine our expertise in the technologies and best practices and your 
               knowledge of your service delivery model to provide you with the right balance 
               of security and accessibility. </p>
