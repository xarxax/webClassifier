<h1>A Visit to Cowper’s Grave</h1>
<div class="long">
<p>I went alone. ’Twas summer time;<br />
And, standing there before the shrine<br />
Of that illustrious bard,<br />
I read his own familiar name,<br />
And thought of his extensive fame,<br />
And felt devotion’s sacred flame,<br />
Which we do well to guard.</p>
<p><q>Far from the world, O Lord, I flee.</q><br />
How sweet the words appeared to me,<br />
Like voices in a dream!<br />
<q>The calm retreat, the silent shade</q><br />
Describe the spot where he was laid,<br />
And where surviving friendships paid<br />
Their tribute of esteem.</p>
<p><q><a href="../../../../htm/t/f/o/tfountfb.htm">There is a fountain</a>.</q> As I stood<br />
I thought I saw the crimson <q>flood,</q><br />
And some <q>beneath</q> the wave;<br />
I thought the stream still rolled along,<br />
And that I saw the <q>ransomed</q> throng,<br />
And that I heard the <q>nobler song</q><br />
Of Jesus’ <q>power to save.</q></p>
<p><q>When darkness long has veiled my mind,</q><br />
And from these words I felt inclined<br />
In sympathy to weep;<br />
But <q>smiling day</q> has dawned at last,<br />
And all his sorrows now are past;<br />
No tempter now, no midnight blast,<br />
To spoil the poet’s sleep.</p>
<p><q><a href="../../../../htm/o/f/o/oforaclo.htm">O for a closer</a></q>—even so,<br />
For we who journey here below<br />
Have lived too far from God.<br />
Oh, for that holy life I said,<br />
Which Enoch, Noah, Cowper led!<br />
Oh, for that <q>purer light</q> to shed<br />
Its brightness on <q>the road!</q></p>
<p><q><a href="../../../../htm/g/o/d/m/godmoves.htm">God moves in a mysterious way</a></q>;<br />
But now the poet seemed to say,<br />
<q>No mysteries remain.</q><br />
On earth I was a sufferer,<br />
In heaven I am a conqueror;<br />
God is his own interpreter,<br />
<q>And he has made it plain.</q></p>

<div class="poem">
<h1>Cowper’s Grave</h1>
<div class="long">
<p>It is a place where poets crowned may feel the heart’s decaying;<br />
It is a place where happy saints may weep amid their praying;<br />
Yet let the grief and humbleness as low as silence can languish:<br />
Earth surely now may give her calm to whom she gave her anguish.</p>
<p>O poets from a maniac’s tongue was poured the deathless singing!<br />
O Christians, at your cross of hope a hopeless hand was clinging!<br />
O men, this man in brotherhood your weary paths beguiling,<br />
Groaned inly while he taught you peace, and died while ye were smiling!</p>
<p>And now, what time ye all may read through dimming tears his story,<br />
How discord on the music fell and darkness on the glory,<br />
And how when, one by one, sweet sounds and wandering lights departed,<br />
He wore no less a loving face because so broken-hearted.</p>
<p>With quiet sadness and no gloom, I learn to think upon him,<br />
With meekness that is gratefulness to God whose Heaven hath won him,<br />
Who suffered once the madness-cloud to His own love to blind him,<br />
But gently led the blind along where breath and bird could find him.</p>
<p>And wrought within his shattered brain such quick poetic senses<br />
As hills have language for, and stars, harmonious influences:<br />
The pulse of dew upon the grass kept his within its number,<br />
And silent shadows from the trees refreshed him like a slumber.</p>
<p>Wild timid hares were drawn from woods to share his home-caresses,<br />
Uplooking to his human eyes with sylvan tendernesses,<br />
The very world, by God’s constraining, from falsehood’s ways removing,<br />
Its women and its men became, beside him, true and loving.</p>
<p>And though, in blindness, he remained unconscious of that guiding,<br />
And things provided came without the sweet sense of providing,<br />
He testified this solemn truth, while phrensy desolated—<br />
Nor man nor nature satisfied whom only God created.</p>
