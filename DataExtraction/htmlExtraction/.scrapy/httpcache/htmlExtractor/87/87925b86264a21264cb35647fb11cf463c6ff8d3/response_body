<CENTER><H3>About the Author Of Financial Insight</H3></CENTER><p>

 Unless otherwise noted, all the above articles are written by Dave Heinze, B. Comm., CMA, CIM.  Dave and his wife, Marian, founded the Heinze group of companies in 1985.  Dave graduated from Saint Mary's University in 1978, with a Bachelor of Commerce Degree.  In 1982 he became a Certified Management Accountant.  In 1996, he completed the Canadian Investment Management Course of the Canadian Securities Institute and became a Canadian Investment Manager.  While many portfolios are not really comparable to any real bench marks, Dave's personal portfolio is similar to a Canadian Equity mutual fund.  He has maintained records since January 1998. As of December 31, 2015, based on the information provided by GlobeinvestorGold.com (Globe & Mail investor service) Dave's 10 and 15 year performance continues to put him in the top third or better of all mutual funds reported on and in the top third or better of the Canadian Equity groups.
