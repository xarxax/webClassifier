            <h2><center><font color="#000099">A Chronological Reading Order
      List</font></center></h2>


      
            <p>At one time I had hopes of not only placing Madeleine L'Engle's
      books in chronological order, but also of figuring out approximately
      what year each one takes place. I gradually came to realize that
      the latter simply can't be done. Being written over a 50+ year
      period, the various books tend to be products of their time,
      taking place either a few years before the year of publication
      (especially in the case of the early books) or five to ten years
      after year of publication (especially the Murry-O'Keefe and Austin
      books). This inevitably has led to contradictory year-specific
      references such as "the end of the 20th century" and
      how long ago man first man set foot on the moon. This is why
      the family trees printed in <i>Many Waters</i> and elsewhere
      refer to chronos (year-oriented time) and Kairos (celestial,
      non-measurable time).</p>


      
            <p>Is it possible to read all of L'Engle's interconnected novels
      in order? Well, yes, more or less, as long as you don't worry
      too much about the exact order of her earliest novels, the exact
      placement of <b><i>A Live Coal in the Sea</i></b> or the proper
      order of <b><i>The Arm of the Starfish</i></b> and <b><i>The
      Moon By Night</i></b>, which take place at the same time. Generally,
      though, it's fairly easy to put the three main series of books
      in order, because of the fairly consistent age references to
      the Murry, O'Keefe and Austin children as they grow up from book
      to book. Technically, most Madeleine L'Engle's other novels connect
      with the Murry-O'Keefe family or the Austin family at some point.
      But if you want to read just the books from the three main series
      in the order they take place, here's the order in which to read
      them:</p>

      <ul><li><b><i>Visions of Fantasy: Tales from the Masters</i></b>&nbsp;
        [Doubleday, 1989] Edited by Isaac Asimov and Martin H Greenberg.
        Pretty good collection of 12 short stories, including Anne McCaffrey's
        "The Smallest Dragonboy."
        </li><li><b><i>Mistresses of the Dark: 25 Macabre Tales</i> </b>&nbsp;[Barnes
        &amp; Noble Books, 1998] Editors unknown. A collection of 25
        dark fantasy "disturbing tales" by Shirley Jackson,
        Doris Lessing, Ursula K LeGuin and other female writers.
        </li><li><b><i>Isaac Asimov's Magical Worlds of Fantasy: Witches &amp;
        Wizards: 24 Classic Spellbinding Stories and Bewitching Tales</i></b>
        [Bonanza, 1983]. This apparently existed as one hardcover book
        (as Witches &amp; Wizards) and as one of a pair of paperback
        books (<b><i>Isaac Asimov's Magical Worlds of Fantasy: Witches</i></b>,
        with the non-L'Engle volume being <i>Wizards</i>).
        </li><li><b><i>The Mists From Beyond: 20 Ghost Stories &amp; Tales
        From the Other Side</i></b> [Editors and publisher unknown, 1993].
        Hardcover and paperback anthology of ghost stories by Fritz Leiber,
        Harlan Ellison and others. I'm assuming that the L'Engle story
        is "Poor Little Saturday" again, but I don't know this
        for a fact.
        </li><li><b><i>Great American Ghost Stories, Volume One </i></b>[date
        and publisher unknown] .edited by Frank D McSherry, Jr, Charles
        G Waugh, and Martin H Greenberg. Lovecraft, Ellison and others.

      <p>Sooner or later, the serious collector faces the question of
whether to upgrade to different editions of the same book, or
even to try to own them all. For example, one might upgrade from
a Dell Yearling copy of <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> to an ex-library
hardback. So far so good, but now what? Do you go after an early
printing of the hardback with the original cover, one that never
saw the inside of a public library? Do you bid on an early book
club edition, dated 1962, with no Newbery medal on the dust jacket?
Do you hold out for a first edition? What about the 25th Anniversary
edition, signed and limited to 500 copies? Or the Advanced Reading
Copy (review copy) editions of later novels? Only you can answer
those questions, but I'll tell you this much: there are a LOT
of editions of most of these books, especially <i>A Wrinkle in
Time</i>, and most of the Dell paperback editions will never be
worth much except as reading copies. You can try for all the different
covers Dell has used over the years, and probably succeed for
not too much money. But I'm not going to try to list every paperback
edition, okay? If you're going to read these books over and over,
as I do, invest in hardback copies. They'll last longer!<br>
