				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Most companies are using applicant tracking systems which ease the daily duties of an HR and make it harder for an applicant to be noticed. How does the system work and how useful is it?</p>
<h1 style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Automate Your Hiring With Applicant Tracking</h1>
<p>Today in the busy world we have to proceed bunches of information, documents, tables, resumes, reports and many other. In order not to lose in the always changing world people use various systematization tools to ease the process. These systems are used everywhere including HR departments. Human resources specialists can receive up to thousand CVs per day which is a huge amount of manual proceeding. ATS (application tracking system) makes it possible to systematize all received resumes and not to lose a promising candidate.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12846" src="https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/upstart-blog-250x167.jpg" alt="upstart blog" width="250" height="167" srcset="https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/upstart-blog-250x167.jpg 250w, https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/upstart-blog-768x514.jpg 768w, https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/upstart-blog-1024x686.jpg 1024w, https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/upstart-blog-624x418.jpg 624w, https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/upstart-blog.jpg 1265w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<h2>What are the tasks of ATS?</h2>
<p>Most human resources specialists with around six years of work experience are convinced that the most efficient instrument in the brunch is an organizational skill. Being organized is the must in the world of recruitment. No technology will provide you with the full hiring procedure. Applicant tracking system can only help you in organizing the process, proceed basic search of candidates with relevant keywords, primary communication via chatbots, and make the process convenient. All the other steps require face-to-face communication, attention, knowledge of psychology, and other skills, which no AI system can yet replace.</p>
<h2>What should a candidate keep in mind?</h2>
<p>Not only it is used for recruitment, but also essential to keep in mind for candidates as well when writing or updating your CV. Almost all job boards and corporations are using a resume tracking system. In other words, if you are using your personal contacts to reach the company, your resume will still be put into professional software filters. This practice has been implemented to prevent discrimination and other unfair hiring practices. The coworkers of the hiring corporations are not allowed to receive personal emails with CVs in it without using ATS.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12847" src="https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/upstart-blog-1-250x167.jpg" alt="upstart blog 1" width="250" height="167" srcset="https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/upstart-blog-1-250x167.jpg 250w, https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/upstart-blog-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/upstart-blog-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/upstart-blog-1-624x416.jpg 624w, https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/upstart-blog-1.jpg 1258w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>All recruitment software has the same principles. A candidate finds a job posting on LinkedIn, Xing, official website of an employer or anywhere else and submit an application. After this, a resume is split into its components. It created a list of candidates all in the same format. To get into an ATS, a resume needs to be formatted in a particular way. Unfortunately, 70% of CVs have formatting errors which prevent it from getting into applicant tracking system. That is why it is decisive for a future career to know the formatting rules.</p>
<h2>Ranking</h2>
<p>Next different applicant tracking systems are using special technologies to rank and sort all the CVs by a stated position. There is a feature which presents on a display top candidates for the position. The recruiter would have to look through all the resumes and determine which are the best match in the past. Now technologies allow getting rid of manual work. However, the negative side of it is a wrong ranking. A candidate with more significant experience and better degree can appear low on the ranking list due to the absence of keywords and phrases. For example, if you&#8217;re looking for a writer&#8217;s job you need to use such keywords writing, editing, copywriting in your CV or even phrases: write my assignment, <a href="https://essayontime.com.au/can-i-pay-someone-to-do-my-assignment-in-australia">pay someone to do my assignment in Australia</a>. That is why it is recommended to use the appropriate keywords and phrases which grants you with a higher chance to be highly ranked in the ATS.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12848" src="https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/upstart-blog-3-250x250.jpg" alt="upstart blog 3" width="250" height="250" srcset="https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/upstart-blog-3-250x250.jpg 250w, https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/upstart-blog-3-150x150.jpg 150w, https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/upstart-blog-3-768x768.jpg 768w, https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/upstart-blog-3-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/upstart-blog-3-624x624.jpg 624w, https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/upstart-blog-3.jpg 1259w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<h2>Top AT systems</h2>
<p>Most companies are buying or creating software and prefer to keep the information of the developer confident. The systems are specially designed for the specific needs of every company. However there they have the same principles of working. <a href="https://www.greenhouse.io/">Greenhouse Software</a> for example except standard sorting and filtering manages hiring process including interviews and organize post-hiring activities. <a href="https://recruiterbox.com/">Recruiterbox Software</a> specializes in job postings in a few social networks simultaneously. It also can bulk import all the applications and ease future steps in the hiring process. <a href="https://www.softwareadvice.com/hr/newton-profile/">Newton Applicant Tracking Software</a> network applicant is cloud-based and has plenty of features like a database of template letters, online application manager, applications for all the devices and phones, analytics, It offers two languages English and Spanish. It is also convenient to arrange an interview in accordance with the availability of both the team member and the candidate. <a href="https://www.jazzhr.com/">JazzHR </a>is a SaaS (software as a service) type of system which includes both posting and application tracking features. A recruiter can manage the complete hiring process through JazzHR including convenient reporting system.</p>
<h2>Bottom line</h2>
<p>The application process is crucial for a career. It is both lottery and hard work creating an appropriate CV to be ranked by your skills. On the other hand, finding and engaging the correct person is a tough task as well. ATS systems make it easier to operate, post, manage, report, schedule and even communicate with the best candidates. However, wrongly created CV can cost you a job position. You, as a candidate, should always consider the help of the professional recruiter who will polish your resume in accordance with the latest needs of modern ATSs. You, as a recruiter, should keep in mind that some good candidate can fail in using the correct keywords.</p>

<p>Hackathons are often seen as a tool for creating new software products, but did you realize that they could be used to create a more engaged workforce as well? </p>
<p>In today&#8217;s show, Ben interviews Toni Eberhart, Executive Director for Urban Engine. In the show, they talk about how things like coworking nights, hackathons, and other social activities can help to crosspollinate ideas and create more satisfaction for technical talent. </p>
<p>In a time where it&#8217;s harder than ever to attract and retain highly qualified technical workers and engineers, is a hackathon the secret ingredient to employee engagement? </p>
<p>Toni recommends that employers look for places, platforms, and programs that allow employees to practice creative autonomy. It&#8217;s not just about creativity for its own sake, it&#8217;s about learning, connecting, and collaborating. </p>

			<p>Candidate experience is a booming business. Anyone with the ability to create a more positive experience for a company’s job applicants is in a great position right now, and that won’t change any time soon. In the last ten years, interest in the candidate experience has grown exponentially, as evidenced by Google Trends data.</p>
<p><script type="text/javascript" src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/1709_RC01/embed_loader.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget("TIMESERIES", {"comparisonItem":[{"keyword":"candidate experience","geo":"US","time":"2007-09-01 2018-12-19"}],"category":0,"property":""}, {"exploreQuery":"date=2007-09-01%202018-12-19&geo=US&q=candidate%20experience","guestPath":"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/"}); </script></p>
<p>On top of that, we’re seeing more evidence that the candidate experience is more than just a “nice to have” for businesses serious about profitability. One <a href="https://hros.co/case-study-upload/hros-case-study-virgin-media-candidate-experience-revenu-stream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HR Open Source</a> case study of Virgin Media highlighted the company’s transformation, detailing just how the firm was able to attribute more than <i>$7 million</i> in revenue to its improved treatment of candidates during the hiring process. This combination of factors is most likely why “candidate experience” was one of the top three priorities for recruiting leaders in the latest <a href="http://lhra.io/blog/todays-top-talent-acquisition-priorities-free-ebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lighthouse Research Talent Acquisition Sentiment Study</a>.</p>
<p>In 2019 and beyond, we expect to see some specific ways this part of the talent acquisition world continues to evolve.</p>
<h3><strong>Video is integral to hiring processes</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12828" src="https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/hiring-candidate-experience-trends-250x187.jpg" alt="hiring candidate experience trends" width="250" height="187" srcset="https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/hiring-candidate-experience-trends-250x187.jpg 250w, https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/hiring-candidate-experience-trends-768x575.jpg 768w, https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/hiring-candidate-experience-trends-1024x767.jpg 1024w, https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/hiring-candidate-experience-trends-624x468.jpg 624w, https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/hiring-candidate-experience-trends.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" />Video is huge, both for businesses and consumers. YouTube is the second largest search engine in the world (with greater traffic than AOL, Bing, and Yahoo combined!). Netflix and other video streaming services now account for the majority of internet traffic worldwide. We have come to expect and appreciate video on many levels, but it hasn’t yet made its way deep into the hiring process.</p>
<p>In one 2017 study, our team at <a href="http://lhra.io/blog/candidate-experience-perspectives-video-interviews-assessments-hiring/">Lighthouse Research</a> found that candidates most want to see hiring managers in videos, not the stuffy “company overview” content that the majority of companies share. Additionally, with greater competition for talent, some companies are now offering video tours of workspaces to help attract the interest of potential candidates. Video is a powerful substitute for in-person experiences, and it’s infinitely more scalable, as well.</p>
<p><b>Video is going to be increasingly woven throughout the hiring process, creating a more personalized and seamless experience for all candidates.</b></p>
<h3><strong>Assessments are appreciated, but…</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve long been told that candidates hate assessments in the hiring process. They slow things down, they muddy the waters, and they don’t add any perceivable value to the overall experience.</p>
<p>The truth is, though, candidates actually <i>do</i> like assessments, but <b>only if they actually give them a chance to show how qualified they are for the job</b>. In other words, don’t throw them a generic personality test and expect them to be happy. Instead, look for ways to allow them to demonstrate their job-related skills and knowledge.</p>
<p>For instance, don&#8217;t ask software engineers to&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>Does HR care more about the employees or protecting the company?</p></blockquote>
<h3>HR&#8217;s Primary Role</h3>
<p>When someone is hired into the HR profession, their primary role is to support the &#8220;people&#8221; functions of the company, such as hiring, training, and retaining employees. It&#8217;s funny if you think about that being the primary responsibility set, because we know that managers select candidates, often recommend workers for development, and are the reason that <a href="https://upstarthr.com/7-hidden-reasons-employees-leave-book-review/">80-90% of workers leave the organization</a>, Regardless, that&#8217;s our job: tie the business objectives with the people process objectives to the degree we can.  <a href="https://upstarthr.com/does-hr-care-more-about-employees-or-protecting-the-company-reader-question/#more-12838" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

<p>Recent research from CLO Media shows that the number one performance metric reported by Chief Learning Officers for learning initiatives is employee engagement. But is this the right metric? Does engagement truly encapsulate how people learn, the impact on the business, and other critical factors? </p>
<p>To answer this question, host Ben Eubanks sits down with Sam Herring, VP and General Manager for Intrepid by VitalSource. Sam has a long track record in learning technology and services and a well-rounded outlook on the profession. In the conversation, Ben and Sam talk about the pros and cons of engagement as a learning metric, how mission-focused learning can lead to better results, and the importance of learning journeys. </p>
<p>If your team is thinking about how learning can partner more closely with the business this year and in the future, Sam&#8217;s insightful takeaways at the end of the show offer some spectacular guidance to that end. </p>

			<p>Wow.</p>
<p>This is the first day back at work for many after the winter holidays are coming to a close, and I hope those holidays were rejuvenating for you and those you care about. The family and I enjoyed some much-needed time off, and weather here in Alabama was nice enough to get out in shorts this weekend for time at the park, bike rides, and more. A great way to refresh things for a great start to the year.</p>
<p>The family and I have been celebrating as my new book, <a href="https://amzn.to/2SEwujy" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence for HR</a>, came out just before the new year. I have been humbled to hear some wonderful feedback from the people that have already been reading the book. I am honored! I won&#8217;t be pushing the book heavily in the coming months, so if you want to read some fun stories, learn about the trends in HR, and understand what the advent of AI within recruiting, training, and more means for your job, this is your chance to <a href="https://amzn.to/2SEwujy">get the book</a>. If you&#8217;re reading it and would be willing to add a review on Amazon, I&#8217;d be very, very grateful (we could work out a signed copy, if you&#8217;re interested).</p>
<p>Finally, this is a new year for YOU as well. Are you certified? Are you thinking about <a href="http://humanresources.thinkific.com" target="_blank">getting certified</a>? Is this the year you pull out your own &#8220;<a href="https://upstarthr.com/develop-your-own-state-of-the-hr-union-address/" target="_blank">state of the union address</a>&#8221; for your own company&#8217;s leadership? Maybe you have decided that this is the year you step it up on the strategic front, creating more value for your employer and a more meaningful HR practice as a result. Is this the year you toss the &#8220;HR&#8221; term completely in favor of one of the newer titles, like &#8220;employee experience&#8221; or something else? I&#8217;d love for you to share what your big goal is this year for you and/or your team.</p>
<p>As always, my team and I try to create content, tools, resources, and other helpful information for you on a regular basis. If there&#8217;s something you need or want that you haven&#8217;t found yet, just throw in a comment below. This is a new year, and we&#8217;re in this together, my friends.</p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiring a new employee is not as simple as it sounds. It is not only hiring but hiring the right employee with skills, experience, and other core attributes. Hiring the right employee brings a sense of increased productivity and growth of a company. He/she will help achieve the company’s goal and visions. On the other hand, hiring a person that does not fit for your company is very expensive, the company has to either fire him and hire another employee or recruit him if all he lacks is the skills and experience needed. Both are going back to looking for another employee and recruiting increases the company’s expenditure. Unskilled employee lows the production rate of the company. Some employees may have experience but lack interpersonal skills such as good communication and teamwork that doesn’t call for recruitment. Hiring the right employee is not an easy task, there are some things you must put into consideration. Below is a list of steps every employer must follow to be able to hire the right employee.</span></p>
<p><b style="font-size: 1rem;">1. Define the job before hiring an employee</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiring new employees starts with </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_analysis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">job analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You need to determine the need to hire an employee. Analyze the duties and responsibilities of the employee to know the skills needed for that particular job. Write a job description to explain what the employee will be responsible for and the skills he or she must have. Failure to do job analysis you will end up hiring an employee who doesn’t fit your company as he/she might be skilled in fields that aren’t available. Job description reduces the number of applications since only people with the stated skills will show up for the job. After you have successfully written the job description and specifications, you can now advertise the job.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12813" src="https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Job-Analysis.jpg" alt="Job-Analysis" width="538" height="331" srcset="https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Job-Analysis.jpg 538w, https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Job-Analysis-250x154.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" /><b style="font-size: 1rem;">2. Review credentials and applications</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After advertising your job, you will receive many applications. You need to review all of them before making your decisions. Screen all applicants against your list of requirements, skills, and experience as per the job description. Even if the first candidate meets your requirements, go ahead and review the others as they may have more than stated in your job description. Application letters, cover letters, resumes, and CV will tell more about the candidate&#8217;s skills, experience, and other important aspects. Some people often make search requests like “</span><a href="https://samedaypapers.com/write-my-paper-for-me-cheap"><span style="font-weight: 400;">can I pay someone to write a research paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CV or recommendation” and therefore may submit fake or altered documents, you need to be able to verify whether the information in these documents is correct before hiring. To know the candidate&#8217;s experience and abilities contact their referees if the candidate claims to have working experience of certain period contact his employer or supervisor to hear his/her views about the candidate. Candidates fresh from college have no working experience, and therefore you need to contact their teachers to know their abilities. Also at this stage make sure to check with the relevant authorities about the candidate’s </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_record"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminal record</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_history"><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some candidates may have all you require but still have a negative criminal record which means employing the given candidate is risking the company. After screening all applications made select the qualified candidates and ask them to come for an interview.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12814" src="https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/blog.jpg" alt="blog" width="226" height="151" /><b style="font-size: 1rem;">3. Interviews</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the stage where you get to know the real candidates. All invited candidates may have the same competent skills, but you have to choose the best among them. Prepare for an interview to evaluate their skills. During the interview get to know whether the candidates have got all the skills indicated in their application letters. Some may have written skills which they can’t be able to implement. Both the employer and the employee are not pleased with firing, and you should not wait to fire when you can be able to evaluate a candidate’s skills. During the interview ask the candidate questions related to the available job to know how much he or she is experienced. It is also during interviews you should be able to tell whether the candidate has skills like good communication, teamwork, hard work, creativity and others that will help grow the company. Failure to conduct an interview you will end up hiring on the basis of papers which may be biased to fool you and therefore having the wrong employee who can’t be able to work with other employees to achieve the set goals and objectives.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12815" src="https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/interview.jpg" alt="interview" width="218" height="164" /><b style="font-size: 1rem;">4. Send an employment letter to the successful candidate(s)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After interviews, you can now be able to rate the candidates based on their performance on the interview. Write an </span><a href="https://upstarthr.com/crafting-a-welcome-letter-to-new-employees/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">employment letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the successive candidates telling them when to report to the company for further directions. It is also wise to write a letter to the unsuccessful candidate(s) informing them that they didn’t qualify.</span></p>
<p><b style="font-size: 1rem;">5. Orientation and recruitment</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reporting to the company, the candidate should be introduced to the company and its team. Starting a new job is not always easy and fast to cope with. Many companies fail to introduce their new employees to the other team which later results in a lack of teamwork. The existing employees view the new member as a stranger. The new employee is also not able to interact with others as he/she does not know who is who in the company. Lack of orientation lowers teamwork which as a result lowers the general productivity rate of the company. Apart from orientation, new employees should also be recruited. He or she might have the experience but remember different companies do things in different ways. In some organizations such as banks, no matter the skills and experience an employee has he/she must be recruited to avoid simple mess which can result in big problems. If you didn’t make to get a person with all the stated skills you may end up hiring the one who is ready to learn new skills. After hiring such a person, before assigning tasks and duties to him make sure he has been trained.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12816" src="https://upstarthr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Recruitment.jpg" alt="Recruitment" width="224" height="154" /><strong style="font-size: 1rem;">6. Fire quickly</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes you may mistakenly employ an employee who has no skills and other important attributes. Having such a person in your company he/she will pull down the production rate. Sometimes you can decide to recruit him but when recruitment can’t help don’t keep him in your company for long. You not only have to fire employees but also other senior employees who fail in their duty. After you have employed a person, he/she is willing to work in the first few months after which he will start losing morale and start reporting to work late, not completing all assigned tasks and poor customer services if he/she gets into contact with your customers. You should let your employees know that whenever they aren’t able to work, they will be fired immediately.</p>
