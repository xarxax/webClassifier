<H3>Classroom Issues and Strategies</H3>



<P>One problem in teaching <I>Love Medicine</I> is the intensity of religious

experience, which many students in today's secular society may have difficulty

relating to. Another is the surrealistic imagery that Marie Lazarre uses

in describing her relationship with Sister Leopolda. And yet a third is

understanding the historical and cultural context of reservation life at

this period of time in the 1930s.</P>



<P>In terms of the historical and cultural context, I would point out to

students that Indian reservations in the 1930s were notorious for their

poverty, their high mortality rate, their chronic unemployment, and the

destruction of the fabric of Native American social and cultural forms.

One of the principal policies of the United States government was to transform

Native Americans into carbon copies of Anglo-Americans, and one of the

principal ways that they hoped to accomplish this, ever since the Grant

administration in the 1870s, was through religion.</P>



<P>During the 1870s, the Native American communities were allocated among

the various major Christian sects, and missionary activity was understood

to be an agent of social and cultural transformation. The objective was

to get rid of the Indian while saving the man. Culture was imagined as

a number of practices and behaviors and customs, which--if they could be

changed--would eliminate all the historic obstacles to the Indians' participation

in Anglo-American culture. Of course, if they were eliminated, so would

the Indian nest be eliminated. Religion then is hardly a simple spiritual

force, but an agent of the interests of the Euro-American majority. Such

an understanding, I think, should help students appreciate the intensity

with which Marie and Sister Leopolda enter their confrontation.</P>



<P>A fine introduction to this story would be to spend a good deal of time

focusing on the first paragraph, trying to understand the tone of the narrator

and also the structure of her vision of herself, which she repeats later

in the story. I would use the imagery and the tone as a way of developing

the narrator's sense of herself, and I would try to account for her intense

antagonism to the &quot;black robe women on the hill.&quot;</P>



<P>Most students are puzzled by the intensity of the antagonism, and they

have real questions as to whether or not Marie or Leopolda or both are

crazy. Students tend to think that they're crazy because of the surrealistic

imagery and because of the intensity of the emotion, which strikes most

of them as excessive. Students need to realize that religion, especially

when it is the lens through which other issues are magnified, can become

the focus of such intense feelings, and that when one's feelings are so

intense, they frequently compel the creation of surrealistic imagery as

the only means to adequately shape what one sees.</P>



<H3>Major Themes, Historical Perspectives, and Personal Issues</H3>



<P>I think that there are two major themes that could be addressed in this

story. The first is to understand religion, as described in the previous

question, as a field upon which two different sets of interests contest

their right to define the terms by which people will understand themselves

and others. For all the black comedy in this story, the battle that Leopolda

fights with the Dark One over the soul of Marie Lazarre is understood by

both Leopolda and Marie as a very real battle. Leopolda represents a set

of values, and so does the Dark One. Marie is understood as struggling

to choose between the values of the Dark One and the values of Sister Leopolda,

and these values are cultural as well as spiritual, for it is precisely

the Indian character of Marie--her pride, her resistance to change, her

imagination--that Leopolda identifies with the Dark One.</P>



<P>A second theme is to view the formation of identity in bicultural environments

as an enriching, rather than an impoverishing, experience. Too often in

bicultural situations, Indian protagonists are represented as being helpless,

suspended in their inability to make a decision between two sets of values

offered to them. The John Joseph Mathews novel <I>Sundown</I> is an example.

In this story, however, Marie Lazarre chooses, and she chooses to identify

herself as an Indian over and against the black robe sisters precisely

by turning their own naivet&eacute; against them. The &quot;veils of faith&quot;

that she refers to early in this story not only prevent the sisters from

seeing the truth, but they also obscure their faith from shining forth,

like the Reverend Mr. Hooper's veil in <A HREF="../iguide/hawthorn.html" target="guide">Hawthorne's</A>

story &quot;The Minister's Black Veil.&quot;</P>



<H3>Significant Form, Style, or Artistic Conventions</H3>



<P>This story succeeds principally as a study of characterization. I would

ask students to pay special attention to matters of tone and point of view.

Since this story is told in the first person, I would ask them, on the

basis of what they have read, to form an opinion of Marie Lazarre and,

secondly, to develop some sense of her judgment of Sister Leopolda. I would

ask them to look especially at the imagery and the language that Marie

uses to describe her encounters with Leopolda and to describe herself,

as the basis for their opinions.</P>



<H3>Original Audience</H3>



<P>The audience for whom this story is written is contemporary, but differs

from the students we meet in university settings by perhaps being older

and therefore more familiar with a traditional religiosity. Students who

are not Catholic may need to know something about Catholicism, especially

the role of nuns, and the historic role of missionaries in relationship

to Indian communities. Other explicitly Catholic references, such as to

the stigmata, are explained by their context in the story.</P>



<H3>Comparisons, Contrasts, Connections</H3>



<P>This story can be usefully contrasted with some of <A HREF="../iguide/oconnor.html" target="guide">Flannery

O'Connor's</A> stories, which focus on the discovery of real faith, especially

from a Catholic perspective. The emphasis on surrealistic imagery provides

interesting connections with poems like those of <A HREF="../iguide/rich.html" target="guide">Adrienne

Rich</A>; since this is a retrospective narrative, one might usefully compare

this probing of a formative event from the narrator's past with Rich's

poem &quot;Diving into the Wreck.&quot; Insofar as this offers us a sensitive

and imaginative teenage minority narrator, the story invites comparisons

with the work of <A HREF="../iguide/morrison.html" target="guide">Toni

Morrison</A> and <A HREF="../iguide/walkera.html" target="guide">Alice

Walker</A>. In Native American terms, useful comparisons would be to <A HREF="../iguide/bonnin.html" target="guide">Gertrude

Bonnin's</A> &quot;Why I Am a Pagan,&quot; as well as <A HREF="../iguide/oskison.html" target="guide">John

Oskison's</A> &quot;The Problem of Old Harjo.&quot;</P>



<H3>Questions for Reading and Discussion/Approaches to Writing</H3>



<P>1. I've never used questions ahead of time for this particular story,

though if I did, I think they would be addressed to issues of characterization

and tone.</P>



<P>2. An interesting assignment, because this story is told from Marie's

point of view, is to retell the encounter between Marie and Sister Leopolda

from Sister Leopolda's perspective. This would require students to formulate

characterizations of Leopolda and of Marie, which would be useful touchstones

for evaluating their comprehension of the issues on which the conflict

in this story rests.</P>
