		<p>Everyone knows Grindr as the most popular gay dating app, but not everyone loves it. If you find you&#8217;ve gotten either bored or annoyed of Grindr, then you need to try out this <a href="https://gaychatapp.com">gay chat app</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard by now, you need to download <a href="https://chappyapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chappy</a> right now if you&#8217;re looking for your new favorite gay dating app. Now, notice that I said &#8220;dating&#8221; and not &#8220;hook up&#8221; app, because this app is going to help you find a partner to be in a relationship with, i.e., dating, and not your next 2 A.M. fuck.</p>
<p>But you could defintely find that in another gay app that&#8217;s tailored for <a href="https://www.besthookupapps.biz/top-ten-hookup-apps-for-gay-lesbian-bisexual-and-transgender/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hook ups</a>!</p>
<p>By reading this article, however, that means you&#8217;re looking to get a boyfriend &#8212; and Chappy is here to help! This gay dating app is quickly becoming the best app on the market for gay dating.</p>
<p>Chappy has been featured on publications like the Independent, Huffington Post, and GayTimes, so you know it&#8217;s legit. When you download Chappy, you&#8217;re downloading an app that, since its launch in March of 2017, has been committed to redefining the gay dating app scene by making it about dating again. They&#8217;re anti-dick pics and pro-dating. So whether you want your next relationship to be long-term or more casual, Chappy can find you exactly what you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>They want to help detach the stigma of hook up culture and dick pics that are so closely related to other gay dating apps like Grindr. Maybe you have grown tired of receiving message after message of &#8220;headless torsos,&#8221; as Chappy puts it, along with an unsolicited dick attached to it. On Chappy, instead of getting messages like these from guys that haven&#8217;t even said &#8220;hello&#8221; yet, you&#8217;ll be engaging in actual conversation to find out whether you like this guy or not.</p>
<p>While other apps like Grindr do have people on there who are looking to date and not just fuck, the ratio is not in its favor. You need an app like Chappy if you&#8217;re looking for love, and not lust.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for an app that is actually about dating, something that arguably has been missing in the gay community for a while now, then I highly recommend Chappy. Chappy&#8217;s mission is to provide you with a &#8220;safe, high-quality platform&#8221; for &#8220;gay guys making connections on their own terms, whatever they are looking for.&#8221; That means that if you want to get married or want a good time with someone you like, you can find either or on Chappy, whereas on other apps the only thing you&#8217;re sure to find are horny men.</p>
<p>So try out Chappy today and finally get a pool of men that are strictly looking to date and form a relationship instead of the usual &#8220;let&#8217;s meet up?&#8221; guys. Your next match on Chappy could be your Mr. Right!</p>

<p>You don’t have to be megastar to make money in the porn industry anymore. It’s believed that even the mid-level amateur pornstars are able to make significant cash by selling their content through social media – and Snapchat in particular &#8211; as opposed to the tried-and-tested website subscription model of days gone by.</p>
<p>Subscription numbers are falling, while pornstars’ social media followers are increasing. This isn’t a coincidence. It tells us that <a href="https://thenextweb.com/market-intelligence/2015/03/24/who-are-the-biggest-consumers-of-online-porn/">consumers of pornography</a> much prefer the interconnectivity which sites like Snapchat offer, allowing for a more customized experience for both the fans and pornstars.</p>
<p>So, if you’re looking to make money as a <a href="https://truesnaps.com">pornstar on Snapchat</a>, here are three points to keep in mind:</p>
<p><b>Personalized content</b></p>
<p>In contrast to the subscription model employed by the majority of pornstars and porn sites over the past twenty years, the advent of social media has allowed stars to cater to their individual fans in a more personalized manner. And Snapchat is the ideal platform for personalized content to thrive.</p>
<p>By connecting with individual fans though Snapchat, pornstars are now able to offer direct personalized content based on their fans’ requests, which the stars will then sell for a sum less than what a subscription is worth. The SnapCash feature built into Snapchat allows for simple payment transactions without the need for an outside platform like PayPal, and SnapCash is able to transfer the money to your account right away.</p>
<p>Even the big-name stars out there have jumped on the trend, including Lexi Belle, Jayden James and Christy Mack. Such content is usually shared for anywhere between $1 and $10 depending on the specificity of the request and whether it’s a picture, video or other.</p>
<p><b>Fan-only access</b></p>
<p>One of the reasons which Snapchat has become a haven for pornstars is because it allows them creative freedom. In professional porn, most stars are told what to wear, how to act and what to say. However, when the only camera pointed at them is their own cell phone, pornstars are more likely to open up and show a side of themselves which professional porn is unable to capture.</p>
<p>Similar to the subscription model of most porn sites, fan-only access is a feature of Snapchat which users must pay for in order to access exclusive content. Behind this paywall is usually a combination of the star’s everyday activities, allowing a glimpse into their personal lives, in addition to more illicit content which is unable to be found on the star’s official site.</p>
<p><b>Content teasing</b></p>
<p>A popular marketing method used by most Snapchat <a href="https://www.xvideos.com/pornstars">pornstars</a> is having one account to promote content, and another account which is exclusively for paid members.</p>
<p>With your free Snapchat account, you would simply post pictures with no nudity, but are still risqué enough to attract a good amount of attention. This would then serve as teasers for the kind of content lying behind your exclusive account’s paywall.</p>
<p>Additionally, a free Snapchat account will allow you a much bigger audience reach, especially if it’s intertwined with your other social media accounts like Twitter and Instagram. Think of your free account as being a mobile billboard, while your exclusive account is the product itself. Want to learn more?  Check out the video below.</p>

		<p><strong>3.) Demonstrate Market Traction and Develop The Perfect Team.</strong></p>
<p>In such an aggressive financial state where only 2.5% of angel-funded businesses move on to raise venture capital, it&#8217;s crucial that a startup can show awareness and related in their market. Early-stage VCs want to witness a considerable market that has enough potential before writing they go write out a check, and startup businesses can reflect this through a pilot or beta consumers. More principally, startup companies should reflect the strategy to change that pilot into a paying customer. Nina Nashif, founder and CEO of <a href="http://healthbox.com/">Healthbox</a>, claims that showing market traffic is crucial, and startup businesses should be able to copy the routine of turning a pilot into a paying customer over and over again. The greater the number and the quality of early customers displays the startup has the ability to grow past the initial interest from early adopters. In terms of teams, many believe that acquiring the right team is the most important key in gaining venture capital funding. Startups barely ever have the perfect item and market it right away, and they will probably need to veer based on customer wants and needs, competitive aspects and industry transformation.</p>
<p><strong>2.) Develop a Compelling Value Proposition</strong></p>
<p>Venture capitalists are very sophisticated in the startup field so you need to be able to prove to them why your business is different and more unique than each of your competitors. Proving to the VCs that you have potential value proposition that is incredibly important, and is often missed by first-time entrepreneurs. Another important factor of creating a value proposition is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability">scalability</a>. Are there enough people into this idea to scan the company? Even if you have a really awesome, intriguing concept, it&#8217;s not fundable if it can’t soar across the world. What market are you looking to go after, and how big is that market? Investors need to understand that the market option is flexible, and that your company can create meaningful traction but only at a particular scale. So, in the end, what you should be taking away from is that if your company is a product, prove that people and their  companies are willing to pay for the product and have a need that is not yet met that your product could definitely fill. If your company is a marketplace, be ready to show traffic on both sides of supply and demand.</p>
<p><strong>1.) Have a Unique Idea With High Barriers to Entry</strong></p>
<p><strong>  </strong>In order for <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/venturecapitalist.asp">venture capitalists</a> to analyze the huge risk that they are about to  take with your business, you need to offer them a fresh and relieving business venture that vows to fill that open space  in the marketplace. Anyone can sell anything online, but there are certain items that have yet to be created — just like the car battery that goes on forever and to infinity, or inventive, reachable and cheaper sources of energy, these are the kind of concepts that venture capitalists would seriously drool over — they are always inspired by the next big thing like anyone else would be.</p>

<p>Hey guys, I&#8217;m Ronnie and I am the writer of the blogs and the maker of the website. I thought you guys should get to know me a little bit about me before reading the blogs! I&#8217;m 27 living in Boston and I double majored in Econ and Marketing. Huge Red Sox fan, big adventurer, adrenaline seeker, and I love anything that has to do with technology. I&#8217;ve skydived, bungee jumped, and parasailed. I actually have my skydiving license so I can jump out of helicopters and airplanes on my own. On my free time, I like to brew my own beer, go to baseball games, build websites, and watch Friends! I come from a small family, I&#8217;m an only child, so I have two dogs to keep me company until I start my own family. One is a Chocolate Lab named buster and the other is a German Shepard named Shiloh. You can definitely say they are my loyal companions. Now that you know a little about me, I hope it makes the content better to read knowing where it&#8217;s coming from. Thanks for reading!</p>
