<H1>DEPOSITION:  Testimony Concerning A Sickness</H1>

<h2>William S. Burroughs</h2>

<i> Reprinted without permission from Burroughs, William S. (1959) _Naked
Lunch_, Paris:Olympia Press.</i> <p>

<hr>
  I awoke from The Sickness at the age of forty-five, calm and sane, and in
reasonably  good health except for a weakened liver and the look of
borrowed flesh common to all who survive The Sickness. . . . Most survivors
do not remember the delirium in detail.  I apparently took detailed notes
on sickness and delirium.  I have no precise memory of writing the notes
which have now been published under the title _Naked_Lunch_.  The title was
suggested by Jack Kerouac.  I did not understand what the title meant until
my recent recovery.  The title means exactly what the words say:  NAKED
Lunch--a frozen moment when everyone sees what is on the end of every fork.
<p>
  The Sickness is drug addiction and I was an addict for fifteen years.
When I say addict I mean an addict to junk (generic term for opium and/or
derivatives including all synthetics from demerol to palfium.  I have used
junk in many forms:  morphine, heroin, delaudid, eukodal, pantopon,
diocodid, diosane, opium, demerol, dolophine, palfium.  I have smoked junk,
eaten it, sniffed it, injected in in vein-skin-muscle, inserted it in
rectal suppositories.  The needle is not important.  Whether you sniff it
smoke it eat it or shove it up your ass the result is the same:  addiction.
When I speak of drug addiction I do not refer to keif, marijuana or any
preparation of hashish, mescaline, Bannisteria Caapi, LSD6, Sacred
Mushrooms or any other drugs of the hallucinogen group. . . . There is no
evidence that the use of any hallucinogen results in physical dependence.
The action of these drugs is physiologically opposite to the action of
junk.  A lamentable confusion between the two classes of drugs has arisen
owing to the zeal of the U.S. and other narcotic departments.
<p>
  I have seen the exact manner in which the junk virus operates through
fifteen years of addiction.  The pyramid of junk, one level eating the
level below (it is no accident that junk higher-ups are always fat and the
addict in the street is always thin) right up to the top or tops since
there are many junk pyramids feeding on peoples of the world and all built
on basic principles of monopoly:
<pre>
	1--Never give anything away for nothing.
	2--Never give more than you have to give
	   (always catch the buyer hungry and always
	    make him wait).
	3--Always take everything back if you possibly can.
</pre>
	
The Pusher always gets it all back.  The addict needs more and more junk
to maintain a human form . . . buy off the Monkey.
<p>
  Junk is the mold of monopoly and possession.  The addict stands by while
his junk legs carry him straight in on the junk beam to relapse.  Junk is
quantitative and accurately measurable.  The more junk you use the less you
have and the more you have the more you use.  All the hallucinogen drugs
are considered sacred by those who use them--there are Peyote Cults and
Bannisteria Cults, Hashish Cults and Mushroom Cults--``the Scared Mushrooms
of Mexico enable a man to see God''--but no on ever suggested that junk is
sacred.  There are no opium cults.  Opium is profane and quantitative like
money.  I have heard that there was one a bbeneficentnon-habit-forming
junk in India.  It was called *soma* and is pictured as a beautiful blue
tide.  If *soma* ever existed the Pusher was there to bottle it and
monopolize it and sell it and it turned into plain old time JUNK.  
<p>
  Junk is the ideal product . . . the ultimate merchandise.  No sales talk
necessary.  The client will crawl through a sewer and beg to buy. . . . The
junk merchant does not sell his product to the consumer, he sells the
consumer to his product.  He does not improve and simplify his merchandise.
He degrades and simplifies the client.  He pays his staff in junk.
<p>
  Junk yields a basic formula of ``evil'' virus:  *The Algebra of Need*.  The
face of ``evil'' is always the face of total need.  A dope fiend is a man
in total need of dope.  Beyond a certain frequency need knows absolutely no
limit or control.  In the words of total need:  ``*Wouldn't you*?''  Yes you
would.  You would lie, cheat, inform on your friends, steal, do *anything*
to satisfy total need.  Because you would be in a state of total sickness,
total possession, and not in a position to act in any other way.  Dope
fiends are sick people who cannot act other than they do.  A rabid dog
cannot choose but bite.  Assuming a self-righteous position is nothing to
the purpose unless your purpose be to keep the junk virus in operation.
And junk in a big industry.  I recall talking to an American who worked for
the Aftosa Commission in Mexico.  Six hundred a month plus expense account:
  ``How long will the epidemic last?'' I enquired.
  ``As long as we can keep it going. . . . And yes . . . maybe the aftosa
will break out in South America,'' he said dreamily.
<p>
  If you wish to alter or annihilate a pyramid of numbers in a serial
relation, you alter or remove the bottom number.  If we wish to annihilate
the junk pyramid, we must start with the bottom of the pyramid:  *the
Addict in the Street*, and stop tilting quixotically for the ``higher ups''
so called, all of whom are immediately replaceable.  ** The addict in the
street who must have junk to live is the one irreplaceable factor in the
junk equation **.  When there are no more addicts to buy junk there will be
no junk traffic.  As long as junk need exists, someone will service it.
<p>
  Addicts can be cured or quarantined--that is, allowed a morphine ration
under minimal supervision like typhoid carriers.  When this is done, junk
pyramids of the world will collapse.  So far as I know, England is the only
country to apply this method to the junk problem.  They have about five
hundred quarantined addicts in the U.K.  In another generation when the
quarantined addicts die off and pain killers operating on a non-junk
principle are discovered, the junk virus will be like smallpox, a closed
chapter--a medical curiosity.
<p>
  The vaccine that can relegate the junk virus to a land-locked past is in
existence.  This vaccine is the Apomorphine Treatment discovered by an
English doctor whose name I must withhold pending his permission to use it
and to quote from his book covering thirty years of apomorphine treatment
of addicts and alcoholics.  The compound apomorphine is formed by boiling
morphine with hydrochloric acid.  It was discovered years before it was used
to treat addicts.  For many years the only use for apomorphine which has no
narcotic or pain-killing properties was as an emetic to induce vomiting in
cases of poisoning.  It acts directly on the vomiting center in the back
brain.
<p>





  I found this vaccine at the end of the junk line.  I lived in one room in
the Native Quarter of Tangier.  I had not taken a bath in a year nor
changed my clothes or removed them except to stick a needle every hour in
the fibrous grey wooden flesh of terminal addiction.  I never cleaned or
dusted the room.  Empty ampule boxes and garbage piled up to the ceiling.
Light and water long since turned off for non-payment.  I did absolutely
nothing.  I could look at the end of my shoe for eight hours.  I was only
roused to action when the hourglass of junk ran out.  If a friend came to
visit--and they rarely did since who or what was left to visit--I sat
there not caring that he had entered my field of vision--a grey screen
always blanker and fainter--and not caring when he walked out of it.  If he
had died on the spot I would have sat there looking at my shoe waiting to
go through his pockets.  Wouldn't you?  Because I never had enough junk--no
one ever does.  Thirty grains of morphine a day and it still was not
enough.  And long waits in front of the drugstore.  Delay is a rule in the
junk business.  The Man is never on time.  This is no accident.  There are
no accidents in the junk world.  The addict is taught again and again
exactly what will happen if he does not score for his junk ration.  Get up
that money or else.  And suddenly my habit began to jump and jump.  Forty,
sixty grains a day.  And it still was not enough.  And I could not pay.
<p>
  I stood there with my last check in my hand and realized that it was my
last check.  I took the next plane for London.
<p>
  The doctor explained to me that apomorphine acts on the back brain to
regulate the metabolism and normalize the blood stream in such a way that
the enzyme system of addiction is destroyed over a period of four or five
days.  Once the back brain is regulated apomorphine can be discontinued and
only used in case of relapse.  (No one would take apomorphine for kicks.
** Not one case of addiction to apomorphine has ever been recorded.**)  I
agreed to undergo treatment and entered a nursing home.  For the first
twenty-four hours I was literally insane and paranoid as many addicts are
in severe withdrawal.  This delirium was dispersed by twenty-four hours of
intensive apomorphine treatment.  The doctor showed me the chart.  I had
received minute amounts of morphine that could not possibly account for my
lack of the more severe withdrawal symptoms such as leg and stomach cramps,
fever and my own special symptom, The Cold Burn, like a vast hive covering
the body and rubbed with menthol.  Every addict has his own special symptom
that cracks all control.  There was a missing factor in the withdrawal
equation--that factor could only be apomorphine.
<p>
  I saw the apomorphine treatment really work.  Eight days later I left the
nursing home eating and sleeping normally.  I remained completely off junk
for two full years--a twelve year record.  I did relapse for some months as
a result of pain and illness.  Another apomorphine cure has kept me off
junk through this writing.
<p>
  The apomorphine cure is qualitatively different from other methods of
cure.  I have tried them all.  Short reduction, slow reduction, cortisone,
antihistamines, tranquilizers, sleeping cures, tolserol, reserpine.  None
of these cures lasted beyond the first opportunity to relapse.  I can say
definitely that I was never *metabolically* cured until I took the
apomorphine cure.  The overwhelming relapse statistics from the Lexington
Narcotic Hospital have led many doctors to say that addiction is not
curable.  They use a dolophine reduction cure at Lexington and have never
tried apomorphine so far as I know.  In fact, this method of treatment has
been largely neglected.  No research has been done with variations of the
apomorphine formula or with synthetics.  No doubt substances fifty times
stronger than apomorphine could be developed and the side effect of
vomiting eliminated.
<p>
  Apomorphine is a metabolic and psychic regulator that can be discontinued
as soon as it has done its work.  The world is deluged with tranquilizers
and energizers but this unique regulator has not received attention.  No
research has been done by any of the large pharmaceutical companies.  I
suggest that research with variations of apomorphine and synthesis of it
will open a new medical frontier extending far beyond the problem of
addiction.
<p>
  The smallpox vaccine was opposed by a vociferous lunatic group of
anti-vaccinationists.  No doubt a scream of protest will go up from
interested or unbalanced individuals as the junk virus is shot out from
under them.  Junk is big business;  there are always cranks and operators.
They must not be allowed to interfere with the essential work of
inoculation treatment and quarantine.  ** The junk virus is public health
problem number one of the world today.**
<p>
  Since _Naked_Lunch_ treats this health problem, it is necessarily brutal,
obscene and disgusting.  Sickness is often repulsive details not for weak
stomaches. 
<p>
Certain passages in the book that have been called pornographic were
written as a tract against Capital Punishment in the manner of Jonathan
Swift's _Modest_Proposal_.  These sections are intended to reveal capital
punishment as the obscene, barbaric and disgusting anachronism that it is.
As always the lunch is naked.  If civilized countries want to return to
Druid Hanging Rites in the Sacred Grove or to drink blood with the Aztecs
and feed their Gods with blood of human sacrifice, let them see what is on
the end of that long newspaper spoon.
<p>
  I have almost completed a sequel to _Naked_Lunch_.  A mathematical
extension of the Algebra of Need beyond the junk virus.  Because there are
many forms of addiction I think that they all obey basic laws.  In the
words of Heiderberg:  ``This may not be the best of all possible universes
but it may well prove to be one of the simplest.''  If man can *see*.
<p>

<h1> Post Script. . . . Wouldn't You? </h1>

  And speaking *Personally* and if a man speaks any other way we might as
well start looking for his Protoplasm Daddy or Mother Cell. . . . *I Don't
Want To Hear Any More Tired Old Junk Talk And Junk Con.* . . . The same
things said a million times and more and there is no point in saying
anything because NOTHING *Ever Happens* in the junk world.
<p>
  Only excuse for this tired death route is THE KICK when the junk circuit
is cut off for the non-payment and the junk-skin dies of junk-lack and
overdose of time and the Old Skin has forgotten the skin game simplifying a
way under the junk cover the way skins will. . . . A condition of total
exposure is precipitated when the Kicking Addict cannot choose but see
smell and listen. . . .  Watch out for the cars. . . .
<p>
  It is clear that junk is a Round-the-World-Push-an-Opium-Pellet-with-
Your-Nose-Route.  Strictly for Scarabs--stumble bum junk heap.  And as such
report to disposal.  Tired of seeing it around.
<p>
  Junkies always beef about *The Cold* as they call it, turning up their
black coat collars and clutching their withered necks . . . pure junk con.
A junky does not want to be warm, he want to Cool-Cooler-COLD.  But he want
The Cold like he want His Junk--NOT OUTSIDE where it does him no good but
INSIDE so he can sit around with a spine like a frozen hydraulic jack . . .
his metabolism approaching Absolute ZERO.  TERMINAL addicts often go two
months without a bowel move and the intestines make with sit-down-adhesions
--Wouldn't You--requiring the intervention of an apple corer or its
surgical equivalent. . . .  Such is life in The Old Ice House.  Why move
around and waste TIME?
<p>
  Room for One More Inside, Sir.
<p>
  Some entities are on thermodynamic kicks.  They invented thermodynamics. .
. . Wouldn't you?
<p>
  And some of us are on Different Kicks and that's a thing out in the open
the way I like to see what I eat and visa versa mutatis mutandis as the
case may be.  *Bill's Naked Lunch Room*. . . Step right up. . . Good for
young and old, man and bestial.  Nothing like a little snake oil to grease
the wheels and get a show on the track Jack.  Which side are you on?
Fro-Zen Hydraulic?  Or you want to take a look around with Honest Bill?
<p>
  So that's the World Health Problem I was talking about back in The
Article.  The Prospect Before Us Friends of MINE.  Do I hear muttering
about a personal razor and some bush league short con artist who is known
to have invented The Bill?  Wouldn't You?  The razor belonged to a man
named Occam and he was not a scar collector.  Ludwig Wittgenstein
_Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus_: ``If a proposition is NOT NECESSARY is it
MEANINGLESS and approaching MEANING ZERO.''
<p>
  ``And what is More UNNECESSARY than junk if You Don't Need it?
<p>
  *Answer*:  ``Junkies, if you are not ON JUNK.''
<p>
  I tell you boys, I've heard some tired conversation but no other
OCCUPATION GROUP can approximate that old thermodynamic junk Slow-DOWN.
Now your heroin addict does not say hardly anything and that I can stand.
But your Opium ``Smoker'' is more active since he still has a tent and a
Lamp . . . and maybe 7-9-10 lying up in there like hibernating reptiles
keep the temperature up to Talking Level: How low the other junkies are
``whereas We--WE have this tent and this lamp and this tent and this lamp
and this tent and nice and warm in here nice and warm nice and IN HERE and
nice and OUTSIDE ITS COLD. . . . ITS COLD OUTSIDE where the dross eaters
and the needle boys won't last two years not six months hardly won't last
stumble bum around and there is no class in them. . . . But WE SIT HERE and
never increase the DOSE . . . never-never increase the dose never except
TONIGHT is a SPECIAL OCCASION with all the dross eaters and needle boys out
there in the cold. . . . And we never eat it never never never eat it. . .
. Excuse please while I take a trip to The Source Of Living Drops they all
have in pocket and opium pellets shoved up the ass in a finger stall with
the Family Jewels and the other shit.
<p>
  Room for one more inside, Sir.
<p>
  Well when that record starts around for the billionth light year and never
the tape shall change us non-junkies take drastic action and the men
separate out from the Junk boys.
<p>
  Only way to protect yourself against this horrid peril is come over HERE
and shack up with Charybdis. . . . Treat you right kid. . . . Candy and
cigarettes.
<p>
  I am after fifteen years in that tent.  In and out in and out in and OUT.
*Over* and *Out*.  So listen to Old Uncle Bill Burroughs who invented the
Burroughs Adding Machine Regulator Gimmick on the Hydraulic Jack Principle
no matter how you jerk the handle result is always the same for given
co-ordinates.  Got my training early . . . wouldn't you?
<p>
  Paregoric Babies of the World Unite.  We have nothing to lose but Our
Pushers.  And THEY are NOT NECESSARY.
<p>
  Look down LOOK DOWN along that junk road before you travel there and get
in with the Wrong Mob. . . .
<p>
  A word to the wise guy.
  <p>
