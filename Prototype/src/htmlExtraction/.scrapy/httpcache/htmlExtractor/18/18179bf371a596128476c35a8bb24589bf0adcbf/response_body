Economists belonging to virtually every school of thought falling outside
the current mainstream have discussed similarities between biological evolution
and economic development for more than a century (Hodgson, 1998). That
evolutionary biology should prove a more fruitful source of inspiration
than classical Newtonian mechanics has long been understood by individuals
who observed that in the <NOBR>&laquo; natural &raquo;</NOBR> and <NOBR>&laquo;
ma</NOBR>n-ma<NOBR>de &raquo;</NOBR> realms, the most significant processes
characteristically exhibit increasing complexity, acceleration through
time, and irreversibility.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></FONT></TD>

Two serious drawbacks, however, have always constrained the rigid application
of biological metaphors to the study of economic development. The first
is that evolution involves no intentionality toward a specific goal, whereas
economic development is driven by the satisfaction of human wants.&nbsp;
The second is that, with the exception of the smallest levels of complexity
(such as genes and microbes), different biological species do not interbreed,
while human beings produce new things by relentlessly combining artifacts,
skills and ideas – including the genes of two different animal species
(Basalla, 1988; DeGregori, 1985; Mokyr, 1990).</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

These major flaws aside, ideas and theories about natural evolution have
in the past provided useful analogies to further our understanding of economic
systems. Closer to us, some economic implications of recent advances in
evolutionary biology and ecosystem analysis are regularly discussed in
academic outlets such as <I>The Journal of Evolutionary Economics</I>,
<I>The Journal of Bioeconomics</I>, <I>The Journal of Industrial Ecology</I>,
<I>The Journal of Social and Biological Systems and Ecological Economics</I>,
among others.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000066"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One of the latest authors to pursue this line of inquiry is social theorist
Jane Jacobs. Best known for her devastating critique of urban planning
(Jacobs, 1961), Jacobs has long analyzed cities as <NOBR>&laquo; pro</NOBR>blems
in organized comple<NOBR>xity &raquo;</NOBR> and drawn on biological metaphors
to explain, among other things, the role of money as a feedback-carrying
mechanism (Jacobs, 1984) and the rationale for political secession (Jacobs,
1980). Her latest offering, however, goes beyond the use of metaphors as
heuristic devices and is better understood as a search for universal principles
that characterize complex systems, both <NOBR>&laquo; natural &raquo;</NOBR>
and <NOBR>&laquo; hum</NOBR>an m<NOBR>ade &raquo;</NOBR>.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

The premise of <I>The Nature of Economies</I> is that human beings exist
wholly within nature as part of the natural order in every respect – a
statement that I suspect will not shock most readers of this journal, but
that is likely to generate much controversy in other circles. In taking
that stance, she tries to distance herself from both <NOBR>&laquo; mis</NOBR>anthropic
ecologi<NOBR>sts &raquo;</NOBR> and economists, industrialists, politicians,
and others who believe that it is possible for human beings to circumvent
and outdo the natural order.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

Written, like her previous book <I>Systems of Survival</I> (Jacobs, 1992),
in the form of a platonic dialogue between a cast of five New York characters,
the main question she tries to answer is: Does economic life obey the same
rules as those governing the systems in nature? The answer given by one
of the characters is straightforward: <NOBR>&laquo; I'</NOBR>m convinced
that economic life is ruled by processes and principles we didn't invent
and can't transcend, whether we like that or not, and that the more we
learn of these processes and the better we respect them, the better our
economies will get al<NOBR>ong </NOBR>&raquo; (p. 11).</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000066"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000066"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jacobs' characters then discuss in the following chapters such processes
as development, expansion, self-refueling, evading collapse, fitness for
survival and unpredictability. Development, whether in nature or in economies,
is thus best viewed as a open-ended process by which differentiations emerge
from generality, which then become other generalities from which further
differentiations emerge. Such development depends, however, on numerous,
various, and intricate co-development relationships. For example, tool
making began with four existing generalities: sticks, stones, bones and
fire. Our ancestors then differentiated those found generalities into many
things from hammers to scrapers and bags, innovations that required the
fusion of other, originally unrelated, innovations.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000066"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000066"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Expansion, whether natural or economic, then depends on capturing and using
transient energy. The more different means a system possesses for recapturing,
using, and passing around energy before its discharge from the system,
however, the larger are the cumulative consequences of the energy it receives.
Thus diverse ensembles expand in a rich environment, which is created by
the diverse use and reuse of received energy. For example, a diversified
city will generate much more local expansion from a new business venture
than a small town, much like a well developed forest's ecosystem will convert
more sunlight into biomass than a desert. The refuelment of growing cities,
unlike their initial start, depends more on replacing imports than generating
new exports.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

According to Jacobs' characters, growing economies, like complex ecosystems,
are <NOBR>&laquo; dynam</NOBR>ically sta<NOBR>ble &raquo;</NOBR> inasmuch
as they can evade collapse by self-correction through the grace of four
processes: bifurcations, positive-feedback loops, negative-feedback controls,
and emergency adaptations. Another check on the collapse of advanced human
economies are human traits such as aesthetic appreciation, fear of retribution,
awe expressed as veneration, persuasiveness, and corrective tinkering and
contriving. Jacobs concludes her dialogue by noticing that systems that
make themselves up as they go along aren't predictable.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000066"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Like all of Jacobs' previous books, <I>The Nature of Economies</I> is superbly
written, idiosyncratic and shows internal evidence of immense research
and intellectual tinkering. Ideas and insights are freely borrowed from
biology, evolutionary theory, ecology, geology, meteorology, anthropology,
history, political science, economics, and other disciplines and carefully
woven into a complex, but succinct, intellectual tapestry. Jacobs is once
again at her best describing complex dynamic processes in an accessible
way and in extolling the virtues of human creativity and adaptation. Her
book contains genuine insights that are likely to challenge, and probably
in time reverse, some economic dogmas.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000066"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000066"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her most important insight, in my opinion, is her case for diversified
urban economies rather than specialization (pp. 106-108). Yet this insight
is not new, for she first developed it in 1969 in <I>The Economy of Cities</I>
and it has been the subject of a heated debate in the urban economics and
economic geography literature in the last decade (Feldman, forthcoming).
Jacobs recasts it in light of the principle that <NOBR>&laquo; dive</NOBR>rsity
of organisms generates biomass expansion owing to multiple reuses of received
energy before it leaves the con<NOBR>duit &raquo;</NOBR> (p. 106), yet
I am not convinced that such an analogy is a major improvement over her
earlier work.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000066"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000066"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The problem here, along with other previous insights that she reformulates
along evolutionary lines, is that such analogies cannot avoid the traditional
pitfalls of biological perspectives on economic development. Economic development
is the result of individuals trying to solve problems affecting them by
combining heterogeneous facts, ideas, faculties, and skills on a scale
that is unparalleled in the rest of nature. So what about intentionality
and combinations for the purpose of creating new artifacts in nature?</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000066"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000066"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As one of Jacobs' characters points out, one should not infer cooperation
(or interdependence as another character suggests) when plants or animals
don't know they are cooperating. To this objection, another discussant
gives the example of a Botswana honey bird that enrolls skunklike mammals
and human beings by guiding them to a hive in the expectation that they
will share the fruit of their capture. But can we truly speak of intentionality
when species exhibit only one kind of interdependent behavior, as many
do? Regarding combinations, another character refers to mitochondria that
power our cells by combining sugar and oxygen to illustrate the universality
of this principle. But as far we know, this is about all that mitochondria
combine. Similarly, beavers mix mud and logs to create dams, but not much
else. Both mitochondria and beavers can generate much expansion, but do
individual specimens generate much development?</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000066"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000066"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I don't think that Jacobs has somehow managed to explain away these pitfalls,
for as one of her characters points out after a discussion of these issues:
<NOBR>&laquo; Of</NOBR> course, development still embodies mystery. Why
should there be a force driving the universe toward intricacy and away
from simplicity? But if the why of development is impenetrable, at least
the how of development is discernib<NOBR>le &raquo;</NOBR> (p. 23). I suspect
that this answer will not satisfy most readers of this journal who are
likely to object that human beings' craving to remove feelings of uneasiness
motivates economic development.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000066"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000066"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are also other ideas and suggestions that I find misguided in this
book, for example, Jacobs' fondness for biomimicry, i.e. the movement for
the development of biodegradable products based on imitating the chemistry
of nature at life-friendly temperatures. What is objectionable about biomimicry
is of course not the basic principle. After all, the Greek philosopher
Democritus pointed out long ago that arts such as weaving, building houses,
and singing were discovered as humans imitated and became the pupils of
animals (Long, 1991: 850).</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000066"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000066"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The problem here is rather the main promoter of this movement, Janine Benyus
(1997), and specifically her anti-market ethos and quasi-religious repulsion
for innovations that are not directly based on nature's imitations. Perhaps
most puzzling, however, is Jacobs' discussion of the benefits of accumulating
human capital and its beneficial effect for environmental preservation.
She refers, among others, to economists Robert Lucas and Paul Romer, but
does not write a single word on behalf of Julian Simon and his collaborators
(Simon, 1995a; 1995b). Perhaps Jacobs' characters' attack on urban sprawl
would have been less stringent if they had known that innovations in agricultural
technologies have reduced farmland requirements to such an extent that
suburban growth has had virtually no impact on the availability of wildlife
areas.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000066"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000066"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To be fair, however, Jacobs' book does contain many valuable analogies
and insights, such as her description of the sun as the <NOBR>&laquo; on</NOBR>ly
natural monop<NOBR>oly &raquo;</NOBR> and her description of subsidies
as <NOBR>&laquo; poli</NOBR>tical and economic addict<NOBR>ions &raquo;</NOBR>.
It also displays, among other things, a much less misanthropic view of
human life than ecological economists and a better understanding of market
processes than industrial ecologists. It is therefore likely to make people
educated in conventional economic and environmental approaches rethink
some of their preconceptions. In the end, however, I am not convinced that
Jacobs' persuasively proves her thesis. Be that as it may, <I>The Nature
of Economies</I> deserves to be read by a large audience, for there will
likely be something new in it for all of its readers.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
