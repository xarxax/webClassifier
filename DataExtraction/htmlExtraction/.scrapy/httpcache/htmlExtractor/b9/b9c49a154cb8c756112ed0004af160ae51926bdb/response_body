                    <p>If you aren&#8217;t obsessed with cam girls on <a href="https://instantchat.com">instant chat</a>, you&#8217;re light years behind the porn revolution, my dude. Gone are the days of trolling Xnxx for pirated Brazzers videos or teen videos. Cam girls &#8211; specifically teen cam girls &#8211; are the best thing to have happened to porn.</p>
<p>Sure, porn stars are like ethereal goddesses from another dimension, but they&#8217;re entirely unreachable. With cam girls, you can have casual conversations with your favorite girl. Why would you watch from a distance when you could interact? Or better yet, direct?</p>
<p>Here are the hottest barely legal cam girls online:</p>
<p>1. ButteryBubbleButt (on <a href="https://chaturbate.com/butterybubblebutt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chaturbate</a>)<br />
Brittany is the ultimate California babe.</p>
<p>This girl has everything: a great girl-next-door face, an ass to die for, and don&#8217;t get me started on the rest of her. She&#8217;s insanely sexy and is the beach babe you always wished you could have.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s super young and yet she offers so many videos of her fucking. You can even pay for custom videos (boy/girl videos too!) and tell her exactly what you want her to do.</p>
<p>Definitely, give this girl a follow on Chaturbate. You won&#8217;t regret it!</p>
<p>2. Eva_Naughty (on <a href="https://chaturbate.com/eva_naughty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chaturbate</a>)</p>
<p>This girl is a total Russian goddess. If you&#8217;re the type of guy who likes a girl decked out in tattoos, then this is the girl for you. She&#8217;s sexy, young, and is fantastic on cam.</p>
<p>She&#8217;ll definitely have you wondering if she could be your Russian mail-order bride after you watch her on Chaturbate.</p>
<p>She even looks like a young, teen version of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0544718/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kate</a> or <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1913734/ " target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rooney Mara</a>, and I mean who doesn&#8217;t love her?</p>
<p>3. Caylin (<a href="https://www.manyvids.com/Profile/114968/Caylin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on ManyVids</a>)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re into Italian supermodels, you&#8217;ll find yourself drooling over this girl. She speaks like 3 different languages, but I don&#8217;t care what language she&#8217;s speaking once she&#8217;s on cam.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s a 20-year-old bombshell who not only cams live, but she sells videos on ManyVids (some of which are girl on girl, two teens at once is the dream right?!).</p>
<p>Her videos are gorgous, and she wears the sexist, but I prefer her with nothing on.</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://mycherrycrush.com/welcome/tour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My Cherry Crush</a></p>
<p>For all of you anime fans out there, you&#8217;ll probably find yourself drooling over this barely legal babe.</p>
<p>This girl&#8217;s hair is constantly changing from one cotton candy looking color to the next. She also goes from lolita to sexy elf to an adorable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catgirl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neko babe</a> in her videos. If you&#8217;ve always fantasized what a pastel Zelda would be like in bed, then you can find out by watching her on cam and in her videos.</p>
<p>Cherry is probably one of my favorite girls on this list&#8230;</p>
<p>5. Yourmidnightcoffee (on <a href="https://chaturbate.com/yourmidnightcoffee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chaturbate</a>)</p>
<p>This girl is so fucking cute it&#8217;s stupid. She&#8217;s 19 and from the US though I think she looks like a Russian doll. She&#8217;s adorable.</p>
<p>Sarah is easily the most underrated girl on this list with the least amount of followers. But I&#8217;m obsessed with her, and you should be too!</p>
<p>If you tip enough (or are lucky enough to be in the room with someone who has) the highest reward on her page is an oil show, and boy is it a sight to see.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The casual nature of fuckbuddy relationships is an ideal convenience in the modern world. For those people who maintain a hectic lifestyle juggling work, family, friends and hobbies, a fuckbuddy allows you to enjoy sexual gratification without all of the relationship hassles that usually comes along with it.</p>
<p>And in a time when communication is as seamless as ever, finding a fuckbuddy has never been easier.</p>
<p>While fuckbuddy relationships usually develop by accident, there are a few ways to go about finding a fuckbuddy without having to go through the common dating channels. Let’s look at a few:</p>
<p><b>Use A Dating Site</b></p>
<p>Despite what you might believe, there are just as many women out there looking for casual sex than there are guys. Women enjoy fuckbuddy relationships just as much as their male counterparts, and so these frisky girls must be lurking somewhere, right?</p>
<p>Of course, and statistics show that the majority of these ladies are hiding on dating sites and apps across the globe. However, it’s important to realize that a lot of ladies who <i>are </i>looking for fuckbuddies don’t advertise outright. While a few girls out there might select “not looking for commitment” on their POF profiles, a lot of ladies will leave this section blank as not to advertise their intentions.</p>
<p>So strike up conversation with as many ladies as possible, and make your intentions known in a tasteful way. “I’m looking for a little fun, nothing serious” will yield much better results than “I want to fuck tonight”, so keep that in mind.</p>
<p>Aside from the common dating sites like POF and OKCupid, aim for hookup-based sites like <a href="https://pure.dating/">Pure</a> an <a href="https://instafuck.com">Insta Fuck</a></p>
<p><b>Post A Personal Ad</b></p>
<p>Sites like Craigslist are one of the go-to places for ladies who are looking for no-strings sex, and it can be a great way to meet potential long-term fuckbuddies.</p>
<p>Posting a personal ad on your local Craigslist section allows you to state your intentions without having to beat around the bush. Make sure to include your age, a physical description and your current situation (recently divorced, single for a long time, etc).</p>
<p>It’s also advantageous to mention that you’re not the clingy type who will keep pestering your potential fuckbuddy for weekly hookups, and will instead let <i>them </i>dictate the pace. This not only allows you set a kind of relaxed vibe, but also says that you’re not overly-desperate for sex.</p>
<p>If you’re not comfortable posting a personal ad, it’s also a good idea to browse the other personals to see what’s on offer. There’s a reason Craigslist is known as the online hub for casual encounters.</p>
<p><b>Use Tumblr</b></p>
<p>This one is a little unconventional, but when done right, the results can be staggering.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know, Tumblr is a platform allowing users to create blogs dedicated to their chosen subject. Naturally, this involves a lot of sex and <a href="http://www.adult-blogs.net/directory/8/Fetish/">fetish blogs</a> personally maintained by people who are into such activities. It’s estimated that around 70% of Tumblr is dedicated to explicit material, meaning there’s somewhere in the region of 300 million sex blogs across the whole platform.</p>
<p>Tumblr is a very “personal” platform, so you won’t find any adult stars or celebrities peddling their wares on there. It’s purely by kinksters, for kinksters, and thousands of people have reported hooking up and meeting long-term fuckbuddies through there. Most bloggers actively encourage interaction, and there are millions of blogs dedicated to people’s personal exploits, so search Tumblr for blogs from people local to you and strike up conversation. Who knows where it could lead?</p>

                    <p><strong>3.) Distribution</strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll have to first find out what the distribution channel you have in mind is, which basically interprets to how you envision your novel to be distributed and where that will take place. Various self-published authors — especially the ones doing it for their first time — may be talked into choosing what some platforms from time to time entitle &#8220;standard distribution,&#8221; or sometimes as online-only sales. Even though this may be the less expensive and easier choice, some platforms contain a kind of distribution that can get your novel a lot more interested eyes, and it&#8217;s definitely something to keep in mind.</p>
<p><strong>2.) Additional Expenses</strong></p>
<p>Along with each and every platform&#8217;s base costs, if relevant enough, you&#8217;ll need to get ready for any other potential purchases. For instance, it is advised and extremely crucial;, if you think you want to thrive in the distribution world, that you purchase your own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number">International Standard Book Number</a> (ISBN), the peculiar numeric code that acts as an accessory for your novel. One ISBN will cost you maybe $99. If you need any aid in editing, design, marketing, and various other services to get your book in its best shape, plenty of protective agencies are more than happy to do all of that extra work for you but for a price. That very price can be in the thousands for the best job done.</p>
<p><strong>1.) Platform</strong></p>
<p>There are lots and lots of platforms you can implement to publish your own novel, so it&#8217;s very important to pick the one that&#8217;s the best fit for you. Think about what sort of novel you are writing. Have you written a quick read, or have you crafted together a book of photography? Do you see your book being available in paperback or in the format of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-book">e-book</a>? Decide which platform is the best fit for your work. The following are popular and use websites that you should definitely be on the lookout for.  Lulu is a site that lets you create a selection of differing books, and even as scan media. You have the ability to download and print a proof of the book, sell it in your own store, and even be able to release in Google Book Search.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.createspace.com/">CreateSpace</a> is kind of like to Lulu. It is owned by Amazon, allows you to make a Kindle e-book along with other platforms through an easier user interface.  CafePress a website that is more popular for selling customized items, such as artwork and clothing, but you do have the option of uploading a PDF of your book and personalize it with different platforms. Blurb is a website that provides free software that helps you in making your book come to life, and it also contains unification with your blog, iPhoto library, Flickr, Picasa, and SmugMug. These are just a few of examples but each site generally contains many functions and a lot of differing pricing choices, so you should definitely give each site a look to see which connects to your budget and tastes.</p>

Hey everyone, thank you for taking the time to get to know me! I am Xiang and I just graduated from Cal Berkley in Northern California. I got my Bachelors in Marketing and I am now working at a marketing agency called Merlot Marketing in Sacramento, California. I always knew I wanted to do something in business because business is always a safe major and business offers so many different types of careers. I got into writing during my second year of college. My roommate used to always keep a journal and write in it whenever she was happy, sad, angry, or even if she just had a great experience with something. She recommended I tried it and once I did, I got hooked. My writing got better and better and I decided to start my own website with my blogs on it. I would post blogs weekly and people would read them and give me feedback and post comments. It has been a hobby of mine for a while now so on my free time I will always try and post a new blog. Now that I am working full-time it has been a little more difficult but I try and make it my priority. Please stay tuned for more blog posts! I really appreciate your time and feedback. </p>
