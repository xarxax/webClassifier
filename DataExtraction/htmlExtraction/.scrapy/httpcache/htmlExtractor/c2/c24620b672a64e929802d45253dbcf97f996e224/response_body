<P ALIGN="left"><FONT COLOR="Black">We are attempting to present an advertising museum with various types of items pictured that are interesting to our viewers to see some of the ideas from the past. As this is a museum there will not be any music or sound effects while you are enjoying your stay in our museum. If you have an old picture of a promotional product or advertising specialty please feel free to send it to us via email at <A HREF="mailto:donace@promotionalproductsandideas.com">donace@promotionalproductsandideas.com</A> and we will be glad to display it here in the museum along with your name to give you credit for your contribution to our museum. Please help us make it grow for our viewers enjoyment .For those that call on a periodic basis we will be adding new items for the museum at the top of our exhibition area which will allow one to see just the new items since ones last visit and not have to scroll thru the previous exhibits that you have perhaps already seen during a prior visit.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="left"><FONT COLOR="Black"></FONT>Here is a typical patent medicine ad from 1880. In Grove's day healthy equalled being plump.. As there wasn't a way to get color register in mass-produced newspapers or magazines, colored ads came from hand-fed lithograph and job presses. Thus advertising was limited to trade cards, multi-sheet posters and counter cards like this one.</P>

<P ALIGN="left"><FONT COLOR="Black"></FONT>Johnny Weisimuller and Maureen O'Sullivan. the Thirties' Tarzan and Jane, appear on a 1934 tray. Drugstore Cokes were served in the classic bell-shaped Coca-Cola glasses etched with the logo. And of course the glasses deserved an appropriate way for delivery to the customers' table.</P>

<P ALIGN="left">The first &quot;Kodak&quot; went on the market in June 1888. This ad was run in September of the same year, and began the campaign that has extended for a century. The first ads sold the idea: &quot;Anybody can use it.&quot; The camera produced crisp, clear pictures (if taken in bright sunlight), but the negative and therefore the prints were circular, taking full advantage of everything seen through the fixed lens. There was no viewvinder, but there was aline embossed on the top of the box that showed which way to point the new contraption.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center"><FONT COLOR="Red">1925 Advertisement for Air Mail</FONT></H3>
<P ALIGN="left">In 1925, six years after the end of World War I. the US government was in the airmail business and trying to sell the service. Commercial airplanes looked like the one behind the lady's head in the ad. They were exclusively mail planes, made of wood covered with fabric, bi-winged with the pilot sitting in an open cockpit toward the rear of his plane so he could watch the ailerons and tail flaps which controlled his flight. An inventor named William B. Stout was convinced that the plane could be made with metal rods inside and covered with a metal skin. He believed the mail plane could be enlarged so that passengers could sit inside protected from the weather. He eliminated the lower wing, enlarged the upper, and put the pilot at the front of the plane. Henry Ford liked the result so well he bought Stout's company and went into the aviation business in 1925.</P>

<P ALIGN="left">The Uneeda Biscuit boy is the story of early American advertising boiled down to a single parable that just happens to be real history. In the early 1890s there were hundreds of hometown bakers putting out generic crackers in barrels with plain cookies in square shipping boxes. Mothers would say, &quot;George, here' s a paper bag. Go down to the store and fill this with crackers.&quot;</P>
