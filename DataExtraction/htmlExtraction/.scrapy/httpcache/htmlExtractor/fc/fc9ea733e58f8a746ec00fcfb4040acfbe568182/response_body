<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Andy McNab joined the infantry in 1976 as
a boy soldier. In 1984 he was badged as a member of 22 SAS Regiment.
He served in B Squadron 22 SAS for nine years and worked on both
covert and overt special operations worldwide including anti-terrorist
and anti-drug operations in the Middle and Far East, South and
Central America and North Ireland.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Trained as a specialist in counter terrorism,
prime target elimination, demolitions, weapons and tactics, covert
surveillance and information gathering in hostile environments,
and VIP protection, McNab worked on co-operative operations with
police forces, prison services, anti-drug forces and western backed
guerrilla movements as well as on conventional special operations.
In Northern Ireland he spent two years working as an undercover
operator with 14th Intelligence Group, going on to become an instructor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">McNab also worked as an instructor on the
SAS selection and training team and instructed foreign special
forces in counter terrorism, hostage rescue and survival training.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In the Gulf War, McNab commanded the famous
Bravo Two Zero patrol, an eight man patrol tasked with destroying
underground communication links between Baghdad and north-west
Iraq and with finding and destroying mobile Scud missile launchers.
The patrol infiltrated Iraq in January 1991, but were soon compromised.
A fierce fire fight with Iraqi troops ensued and the patrol was
forced to escape and evade on foot to Syria. Three of the eight
men were killed; four were captured after three days on the run;
one escaped.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">One of the four taken prisoner, McNab was
held for six weeks and was relentlessly and savagely tortured.
By the time he was released he was suffering from nerve damage
to both hands, a dislocated shoulder, kidney and liver damage
and had contracted hepatitis. After six months of medical treatment
he was back on active service.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The truly heroic exploits of the Bravo Two
Zero patrol have been recognised the world over and, in the words
of the patrol's commanding officer, &quot;will remain in regimental
history forever&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Awarded both the Distinguished Conduct Medal
(DCM) and Military Medal (MM) during his military career, McNab
was the British Army's most highly decorated serving soldier when
he finally left the SAS in February 1993.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Andy McNab has written about his experiences
in the SAS in two best selling books. <I>Bravo Two Zero</I> is
the highest selling war book of all time and has sold 1.5 million
copies in the UK alone. It has been published in 17 countries
and translated into 16 languages. The CD spoken word version of
<I>Bravo Two Zero</I>, narrated by McNab, sold over 60,000 copies
and earned a silver disc.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Arial">Immediate Action</FONT></I><FONT FACE="Arial">,
McNab's autobiography, spent 18 weeks at the top of the best-seller
lists following the lifting of an ex-parte injuction granted to
the Ministry of Defence in September 1996. <I>Immediate Action</I>
has sold over 1 million copies in the UK to date.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">McNab's first novel, <I>Remote Control,</I>
was published in November 1997, and is being published by Corgi
in paperback in October (along with the tie-in edition of <I>Bravo
Two Zero</I>).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
Outside of writing, McNab was technical weapons advisor and trainer
on the hit Michael Mann film <I>Heat </I>(1995) and spent five
months in Hollywood working closely with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino
and Val Kilmer. As well as advising on weapons handling and use,
McNab was drafted in to work out in detail how master-thief De
Niro would go about pulling off robberies on an armoured car and
a bank, and how cop Al Pacino would go about tracking him down
and stopping him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">McNab was a major contributor to the BBC-2
<I>Timewatch</I> documentary on Hannibal (1996), which was fronted
by General Norman Schwarzkopf, and was also the advisor and narrator
on BMG's <I>Ultimate Warrior </I>video. The first McNab computer
game will also be released this Autumn.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Also a director of a Hereford based security
company, McNab developed and runs a specialist training course
for news crews, journalists and members of non-governmental organisations
working in hostile environments (including war zones). The course
is currently the only one if its kind in the world.</FONT></P>
