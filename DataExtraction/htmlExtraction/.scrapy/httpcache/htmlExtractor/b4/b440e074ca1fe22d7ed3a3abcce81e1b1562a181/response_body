<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times">Charles Waddell Chesnutt
(1858-1932), is regarded as one of the most accomplished late-19th-century
American writers of fiction, and was one of the best known and critically
acclaimed African American writers of his day. He is best known as the
author of the novels The Marrow of Tradition (1901) and The House Behind
the Cedars (1900), as well as the short story collections The Wife of his
Youth (1899) and The Conjure Woman (1899). Chenutt was an astute and nuanced
chronicler of the aftermath of slavery in the south, and was particularly
interested in the arbitrary yet powerful legal and social conventions of
the "color line" separating black from white. Increasingly alarmed by the
rise of racial tensions and violence in the 1890's, Chesnutt hoped that
his most ambitious novel, The Marrow of Tradition, would have an impact
on the nation of the order of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Unfortunately, his most
powerful work of social criticism was not critically successful in his
day, and his literary reputation was soon eclipsed by the vibrancy and
innovation of the Harlem Renaissance writers.</FONT>

<P>Today, interest in Chesnutt is once again on the rise. This literary
web site is a contribution to the new conversation about Charles Chesnutt.
The focus here is not on biography or history, but on Chesnutt's literary
achievement.
