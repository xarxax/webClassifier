      <TD BGCOLOR="#E6E6FF"><FONT FACE="Helvetica, Arial">Born in Fuente Vaqueros, 
        Granada, Spain, June 5,1898; died near Granada, August 19,1936, Garc&iacute;a 
        Lorca is Spain's most deeply appreciated and highly revered poet and dramatist. 
        His murder by the Nationalists at the start of the Spanish civil war brought 
        sudden international fame, accompanied by an excess of political rhetoric 
        which led a later generation to question his merits; after the inevitable 
        slump, his reputation has recovered (largely with a shift in interest 
        to the less obvious works). He must now be bracketed with MACHADO as one 
        of the two greatest poets Spain has produced this century, and he is certainly 
        Spain's greatest dramatist since the Golden Age. </FONT> 
        <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica, Arial">As a poet, his early reputation rested 
          on the <I>Romancero gitano</I> (Madrid, 1928; tr. R. Humphries, <I>The 
          Gypsy Ballads of Garc&iacute;a Lorca</I>, Bloomington, 1953), the poems 
          of <I>Poema del Cante Jondo</I> (Madrid, 1931), and <I>Llanto por Ignacio 
          Sanchez Mejias</I> (Madrid, 1935; tr. A. L. Lloyd, in <I>Lament for 
          the Death of a Bullfighter, and Other Poems</I>, London, 1937), all 
          profoundly Andalusian, richly sombre in their mood and imagery, and 
          disquieting in their projection of a part-primitive, part-private world 
          of myth moved by dark and not precisely identifiable forces; but, beneath 
          the flamenco trappings, there is a deeper - perhaps personal - anguish, 
          as well as a superb rhythmical and linguistic sense (the <I>Llanto</I> 
          is one of the four best elegies in the Spanish language). Critical interest 
          has since shifted to the tortured, ambiguous and deliberately dissonant 
          surrealist poems of <I>Poeta en Nueva York</I> (Mexico City, 1940; tr. 
          B. Belitt, <I>Poet in New York</I>, London, 1955), and to the arabesque 
          <I>casidas </I>and <I>gacelas </I>of <I>Divein de Tamarit</I> (NY, 1940). 
          An early major anthology in English is <I>Poems </I>(tr. S. Spender 
          &amp; J. L. Gili, London, 1939). </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica, Arial">As a dramatist, early romantic pieces 
          with social implications such as <I>Mariana Pineda</I> (Madrid, 1928; 
          tr. J. GrahamLuidn &amp; R. L. O'Connell in <I>Collected Plays</I>, 
          London, 1976) and the comic invention of <I>La zapatera prodigiosa</I> 
          (first performed 1930, amplified 1935, pub. Buenos Aires, 1938; <I>The 
          Shoemaker's Prodigious Wife</I> in <I>Collected Plays</I>) established 
          him in the public eye, while his fostering of popular theatre gave him 
          a left-wing reputation which contributed to his death (although his 
          homosexuality also made him a target). </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica, Arial">His reputation as a playwright rests, 
          however, mainly on the three 'folk tragedies', <I>Bodas de sangre</I> 
          (Madrid, 1935; <I>Blood Wedding</I>), Yerma (Buenos Aires, 1937) and 
          <I>La casa de Bernarda Alba</I> (Buenos Aires, 1940; <I>The House of 
          Bernarda Alba</I>: all three tr. J. Graham-Lujan &amp; R. L. O'Connell, 
          in <I>III Tragedies</I>, NY, 1959, incorporated into <I>Collected Plays</I>), 
          whose settings recall the <I>Romancero gitano</I>, as do the unspecified 
          dark forces (associated with earth, blood, sex, water, fertility/infertility, 
          death, and the moon) which appear to manipulate the characters in <I>Bodas 
          de sangre</I> and <I>Yerma</I>. Both these plays are richly poetic, 
          with an almost ritualized primitivism (Lorca was highly superstitious, 
          and his dark forces were not mere dramatic ploys). </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica, Arial"><I>La casa de Bernarda Alba</I> is starker: 
          deliberately prosaic, more readily interpretable as social criticism 
          (i.e. of the pressures of convention, the imprisoning effect of mourning 
          customs, the frustration of female sexuality by the need to wait for 
          an acceptable match), but it is so dominated by the title character 
          - who tyrannizes her five daughters - that it emerges as the study of 
          a unique individual rather than a typical woman. Each tragedy has one 
          outstanding female role, those of Yerma and Bernarda having been written 
          for the great tragic actress Margarita Xirgu. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT FACE="Helvetica, Arial">Lorca's technical experimentation (which 
          has affinities with innovators as dissimilar as PIRANDELLO and BRECHT) 
          was immensely versatile, and he had a superb sense for stage-effects 
          to reinforce the web of his recurrent imagery. </FONT></P>
