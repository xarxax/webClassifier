	What laughing chains the water wove and threw!
	I learned to catch the trout's moon whisper; I
	Drifted how many hours I never knew,
	But, watching, saw that fleet young crescent die,---

	And one star, swinging, take its place, alone,
	Cupped in the larches of the mountain pass ---
	Until, immortally, it bled into the dawn.
	I left my sleek boat nibbling margin grass. . .

Biography, Greenberg's prose "Between Historical Life," bibliography, e-text of 26 poems, facsimiles of 2 poems (handwritten manuscript versions), info on New York city with 3 maps of the areas where he lived, info on Hart Crane who was greatly influenced by Greenberg's poems. According to Mr. Michael L. Smith, who maintains the site, "Crane's poem "Emblems of Conduct" is actually a mosaic of slightly-altered lines taken from six of Greenberg's poems."
