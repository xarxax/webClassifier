		<p>Hailed by <em>The Washington Post</em> as “one of Nashville&#8217;s finest song interpreters,” <strong>Kathy Mattea</strong> has enjoyed the kind of success many artists only dream of: two <span class="caps">GRAMMY</span> wins, four <span class="caps">CMA</span> Awards, four #1 country singles, and five gold albums (plus a platinum collection of her greatest hits). The dream almost ended, though, when Mattea entered her 50s and began to find her voice changing. What followed was a three-year journey through life challenges, soul-searching, and professional uncertainty, a trying time of personal anguish that threatened to silence her permanently, but instead brought her unexpected joy.</p>

	<p>“The hardest thing was facing the question of whether I would still be able to sing well enough to enjoy it. That was the acid test for me, and I had to be willing to walk through a process that bumped me up against the very real possibility that, in the end, the answer might be “No.” </p>

	<p>Mattea dug in with a vocal coach, re-committed to her music, and emerged with the most poignant album of her career, <em>Pretty Bird</em>. Working with her old friend, music roots wizard <strong>Tim O’Brien</strong>, producing, <em>Pretty Bird</em> is a chronicle of her journey, song by song, back to singing for the sheer joy of it. It’s an emotional, moving collection, one that draws its strength not only from Mattea’s touching performances, but also from her uncanny ability to weave seemingly disparate material into a cohesive whole. From a playful take on Oliver Wood’s “Chocolate On My Tongue” to a tender rendition of Mary Gauthier’s “Mercy Now,” from a British traditional to a Bobbie Gentry classic, these are the songs that helped Mattea reclaim her voice, and she inhabits each as fully as if it were her own.</p>

	<p>Exquisitely arranged and delivered with the kind of subtlety and nuance that can only come from a lifetime of heartbreak and triumph, <em>Pretty Bird</em> is a title Kathy Mattea inhabits quite literally, and it’s a welcome reintroduction to one of country and Americana music’s most enduring and beloved figures.</p></div>

				<p><strong>The Acoustic Living Room</strong><br />
<strong>Songs and Stories with Kathy Mattea</strong><br />
<strong>Featuring Bill Cooley</strong><br />
Grammy Award winning singer <strong>Kathy Mattea</strong> and her longtime collaborator, guitarist <strong>Bill Cooley</strong>, have shared one of Nashville&#8217;s most musically rich partnerships for over two decades. The duo meets as old friends, welcoming you into <strong><em>The Acoustic Living Room</em></strong> to share songs and stories near and dear to their hearts &#8212; including Kathy&#8217;s beloved classics such as &#8220;18 Wheels and a Dozen Roses,&#8221; &#8220;Where&#8217;ve You Been?,&#8221; and many other hits, plus a handful of more eclectic and often requested tunes from her extensive catalogue, and a sprinkling of brand new material, all reinterpreted for the duo format. Her 18 albums are woven through with bluegrass, gospel, and Celtic influences, and have garnered multiple <span class="caps">CMA</span>, <span class="caps">ACM</span>, and Grammy Awards. A genuine storyteller, Kathy draws inspiration from her Appalachian roots and is a torchbearer for often overlooked musical legacies like those of Hazel Dickens and Jean Ritchie. Her most recent album, <em>Calling Me Home</em>, is a collection of songs that celebrates the Appalachian culture of her native West Virginia and expands the vocabulary of acoustic roots music that has always served as her artistic center. Kathy looks forward to sharing a new album with audiences in 2018.</p>

			<h2>Kathy Mattea Speaking/Keynote</h2>

				<p>The unmistakable voice of Grammy Award winner <strong>Kathy Mattea</strong> explores music&#8217;s most basic human essence through timeless melodies and uplifting narratives. Singer, musician, songwriter, public speaker, activist: Mattea&#8217;s music and message have taken her to venues across America from Maine to Alaska, and overseas from England to Morocco, from college campuses to capitol buildings, and from festivals to concert halls. Mattea&#8217;s music has spoken to millions of people during her 30-plus years as a recording and touring artist. Increasingly in demand as a public speaker, she has found a growing audience for the words and ideas she has to offer on a variety of issues, ranging from arts education to finding your creative path to global climate change, regularly presenting keynotes and educational programs at colleges and civic venues, both as stand-alones and in conjunction with concert appearances.
