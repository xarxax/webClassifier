									Who You Are, 
									<br />
									Mr. or Ms. Entrepreneur 
								</div>
								<p>
									With your arrival at our home page, we make some assumptions about you. As a first thought, we believe you're an entrepreneur and, being one, you have certain characteristics. Almost by definition, you consider yourself an achiever. You want to improve your business and take it to the next level. You feel that what you offer is unique. You'd ideally like to be in the vanguard of your industry and, possibly, offer your products or services internationally. You pride yourself on the quality and prestige of your offering. And customer service is one of your prime business tools. We are honoured that you've arrived here and will do our utmost to serve you to the best of our abilities. 
								</p>
								<div class="sub-head">
									What Is Capital Funds Group, Ltd.? 
								</div>
								<p>
									Capital Funds Group, Ltd. has been in business for 20 years, first in the US, now serving you from Canada. We're specialists in financial services and consulting to a broad spectrum of businesses in a variety of countries. Service and satisfaction are what we provide. Our aim is Bringing Business and Money Together. 
								</p>
								<p>
									To do that, we offer two primary financial services. 
								</p>
								
								<div class="sub-head">
									1. Business Loans and Expansion Capital (Updated)
								</div>
								<p>
									<strong>
										<font color="red">We service ONLY the US, Canada and Puerto Rico!</font></strong></p>
								<p>
									Here we work with FOUR different lending scenarios. 
								</p>
								<p>
								In the first, we are presenting a new service, Securities Loans and Lines of Credit based on your own US securities holdings.  Rates begin at 2.5% and credit and income are not considered. Details may be 
found <a href="businessloans/index.php#sourceone">here</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our second loan scenario handles loans from US$300,000 up to $10 million. We have been working with this company for 20 years. The loans must be secured by real estate, be for business purposes only 
and be located in the Western US states. For more details, click <a href="businessloans/index.php#sourcetwo">here</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									The third loan source is what is called "hard money." That means it's more expensive and you'll need to have some fee money from the beginning. They handle loans from $1 million to $300 million and can and do work internationally. ($3 million minimum outside the US.) They have been in business successfully for over 20 years and have concluded hundreds of millions in loan deals. Details can be found <a href="businessloans/index.php#sourcethree">here</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our fourth and newest source makes us able to offer SMALL BUSINESS LOANS, $10,000 to $2,000,000. See details <a href="http://www.capitalfundsgroup.com/businessloans/four.php">here</a>.
								</p>
								<div class="sub-head">
									2. Factoring of Invoices and Accounts Receivable 
								</div>
								<p>
									As we state repeatedly, <b>Cash Flow is King</b>. Without it, no company can long remain in business. 
								</p>
								<p>
									For wholesale businesses, selling goods and/or services to other businesses, <b>factoring</b>, with its 3000 year history, is the most natural and effective solution to rapid cash flow one can find. In addition, it's the most inexpensive money a company can secure to keep the business expanding. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Unfortunately, factoring also represents the most misunderstood financial source in business. Almost every new client we speak with misunderstands its costs and consistently thinks of factoring and its costs as loans. Nothing could be further from the truth. To learn more about and fully understand this simple yet incredible business and financial resource, read our factoring page <a href="factoring/">here</a>. 
								</p>
								<div class="sub-head">
								</div>
								<p>
									So once again, <b>Welcome to Capital Funds Group</b>. We look forward to serving you. 
								</p>
								<p>
								</p>
								<div class="byline">
									Best regards, 
									<br />
									Eric Barnes
