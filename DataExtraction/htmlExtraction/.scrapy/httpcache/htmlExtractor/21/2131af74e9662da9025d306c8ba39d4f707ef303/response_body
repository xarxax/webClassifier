ESSENTIALS OF SPONTANEOUS
          PROSE
<br>
Jack Kerouac</h2></center>
<p>
<hr>
 <b>SET-UP</b> The object is set before the mind, either in reality.
 as in sketching (before a landscape or teacup or old face) or
 is set in the memory wherein it becomes the sketching from
 memory of a definite image-object.
<p>
 <b>PROCEDURE</b> Time being of the essence in the purity of
 speech, sketching language is undisturbed flow from the mind
 of personal secret idea-words, blowing (as per jazz musician)
 on subject of image.
<p>
 <b>METHOD</b> No periods separating sentence-structures already
 arbitrarily riddled by false colons and timid usually needless
 commas-but the vigorous space dash separating rhetorical
 breathing (as jazz musician drawing breath between outblown
 phrases)--"measured pauses which are the essentials of our
 speech"--"divisions of the sounds we hear"-"time and how
<a href=../50s/kerouac-jack.jpg><img src=../50s/jack-small.jpg 
align=right></a>
 to note it down." (William Carlos Williams)
<p>


 <b>SCOPING</b> Not "selectivity'  of expression but following free
 deviation (association) of mind into limitless blow-on-subject
 seas of thought, swimming in sea of English with no discipline
 other than rhythms of rhetorical exhalation and expostulated 
statement, 
like a fist coming down on a table with each complete utterance, 
bang! (the space dash)-Blow as deep as you
 want-write as deeply, fish as far down as you want, satisfy
 yourself first, then reader cannot fail to receive telepathic
 shock and meaning-excitement by same laws operating in his
 own human mind.
<p>
 <b>LAG IN PROCEDURE</b> No pause to think of proper word but
 the infantile pileup of scatological buildup words till
satisfaction is gained, which will turn out to be a great appending
 rhythm to a thought and be in accordance with Great Law of
 timing.
<p>
 <b>TIMING</b> Nothing is muddy that runs in time and to laws of
 time-Shakespearian stress of dramatic need to speak now in
 own unalterable way or forever hold tongue-no revisions (except 
obvious rational mistakes, such as names or calculated
  insertions in act of not writing but inserting).
<p>
  <b>CENTER OF INTEREST</b> Begin not from preconceived idea of
  what to say about image but from jewel center of interest in
  subject of image at moment of writing, and write outwards
  swimming in sea of language to peripheral release and
  exhaustion-Do not afterthink except for poetic or P. S.
  reasons.  Never afterthink to "improve" or defray impressions,
  as, the best writing is always the most painful personal wrung-out 
tossed from cradle warm protective mind-tap from
  yourself the song of yourself, blow!-now!-your way is
  your only way-"good"-or "bad"-always honest ("ludi-
  crous"), spontaneous, "confessionals' interesting, because not
  "crafted." Craft is craft.
<p>
  <b>STRUCTURE OF WORK</b> Modern bizarre structures (science fiction, 
etc.) arise from language being dead, "different" themes
  give illusion of "new" life.  Follow roughly outlines in
outfanning movement over subject, as river rock, so mindflow over
  jewel-center need (run your mind over it, once) arriving at
  pivot, where what was dim-formed "beginning" becomes
  sharp-necessitating "ending" and language shortens in race to
  wire of time-race of work, following laws of Deep Form, to
  conclusion, last words, last trickle-Night is The End.
<p>
  <b>MENTAL STATE</b> If possible write "without consciousness" in  
semi-trance (as Yeats' later "trance writing") allowing subconscious 
to admit in own uninhibited interesting necessary and
  so "modern" language what conscious art would censor, and
  write excitedly, swiftly, with writing-or-typing-cramps, in accordance
 (as from center to periphery) with laws of orgasm,
  Reich's "beclouding of consciousness." Come from within,
  out-to relaxed and said.
