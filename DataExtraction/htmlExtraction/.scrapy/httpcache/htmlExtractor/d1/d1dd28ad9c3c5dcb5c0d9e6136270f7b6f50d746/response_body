<blockquote><b><font size="+2">T</font></b>he Carter Family made their first
recordings for Ralph Peer on the Victor label in 1927, in Bristol, Tennessee.&nbsp;
During the next 17 years they recorded some 300 old-time ballads, traditional
tunes, country songs, and Gospel hymns, all representative of America's
southeastern folklore and heritage.
<p>The original Family consisted of Mother Maybelle Addington Carter (1909-1979),
who played guitar and sang harmony; Sara Dougherty (1898-1979), who played
autoharp and sang alto lead; and Sara&#8217;s husband, Alvin Pleasant (A.P.)
Carter (d.1960), who played fiddle and sang bass.
</p><p>They operated out of their homes in the Clinch Mountain area of Virginia
until 1938, when they moved to Texas for three years, and then to Charlotte,
North Carolina.&nbsp; They did their last radio show together in 1942,
after which Maybelle Carter, who has been called the "Queen of Country
Music," continued the tradition and her career with her three daughters,
Anita, Helen, and <a href="http://www.johnnycash.com/june/tribute.html">June</a>
who is married to <a href="http://www.johnnycash.com">Johnny Cash</a>.
</p><p>After working on WRWL Radio in Richmond, Virginia, from 1943 to 1946,
Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters, as they were billed, moved first
to WRVA, also in Richmond, for 18 months, and then to WNOX in Knoxville,
Tennessee.&nbsp; When they were finally tapped by the <a href="http://www.southernmusic.net/grandoleopry.htm">Grand
Ole Opry,</a> Nashville became their last stop and home.&nbsp; In popularizing
and preserving old folk songs, the family made accessible tunes that were
later used by Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, Odetta, Woody Guthrie, and many more.&nbsp;

apparently tried for a job back at WRNL in mid-1949. Maybelle still owned
an old plantation in Richmond where she had had the slave cabins torn down.
(She later wished she had preserved them for the history.) They ended up
at KWTO, Springfield, MO. They sold the Richmond mansion and Maybelle's
husband Ezra "Eck" (A.P.'s brother) brought the furniture out to Springfield.
I think they went from KWTO to the <a href="http://www.southernmusic.net/grandoleopry.htm">Opry</a>.</font>

<blockquote><small><br><br>BB = Billboard, V = Variety.
</small><p><small><small>1942 May 2, BB, p. 67.&nbsp; In Charleston, W. Va., [juke box] operators
say, top favorites are &#8220;The Girl on the Greenbrier Shore&#8221; (Carter Family)
and &#8220;Barstool Cowboy&#8221; (Spike Jones).
</small></small></p><p><small><small>1942 May 16, BB, p. 13.&nbsp; Jolly Joyce, Philadelphia, has signed
booking exclusives for the summer on the Carter Family, Hugh Cross and
His Radio Pals, and Cousin Emmy and Her Kinfolk.&nbsp; Mostly for outdoor
parks and celebrations.
</small></small></p><p><small><small>1942 May 16, BB, p. 77.&nbsp; The Carter Family is being represented
by Jolly Joyce, of Philadelphia, for personal appearances at parks and
events in the East during the summer.
</small></small></p><p><small><small>1942 July 11, BB, p. 69.&nbsp; Ottawa seems to go for Carters, the top
tunes up there being &#8220;I&#8217;m Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes,&#8221; as sung by
Wilf Carter (Montana Slim), and &#8220;Something Got a Hold of Me,&#8221; as sung by
the Carter Family.
</small></small></p><p><small><small>1942 August 15, p. 68.&nbsp; Record Review: The Carter Family (Bluebird
B-9026) &#8220;Keep on the Firing Line&#8221; and &#8220;Fifty Miles of Elbow Room.&#8221;&nbsp;
A couple of spirituals delivered in the familiar and excellent style of
the Carters.&nbsp; It&#8217;s one of their best couplings in many moons.&nbsp;
Both tunes are catchy and appealing, and both are given by solo and chorus
voices with guitar and auto-harp accompaniment.&nbsp; &#8220;Firing Line&#8221; has
no actual current implications, but its title may get it current-event
play.&nbsp; &#8220;Elbow Room&#8221; is, if anything, even more appealing than the
A side.&nbsp; Either should go well anywhere spirituals or the Carter Family
catch the coins.
</small></small></p><p><small><small>1943 February 20, BB, p. 5.&nbsp; WSM Billy Jambo Sets Cincy Record,
Cincinnati, Feb. 18. &#8211; A crowd estimated at more than 13,000, the largest
ever to witness a so-called hillbilly show in a single day in Cincinnati,
jammed the 3,576-seat Music Hall auditorium at three performances Sunday
(7) to witness the
<br>WMS [sic] Radio Jamboree, presented under the direction of J. L. Frank.&nbsp;
Prices were scaled at 30, 60 and 75 cents, including tax.
<br>&#8230;
</small></small></p><p><small><small>Acts on the bill, in the order of appearance, were Whitey Ford, &#8220;the
Duke of Paducah&#8221;; Cliff Cross and His Texas Cowboys, Daniels [sic] Quartette,
Jamup and Honey, Pee Wee King and the Golden West Ramblers [sic], Ernest
Tubb, Minnie Pearl, San Antonio Rose, Uncle Dave Macon, Roy Acuff and His
Smoky Mountain Boys, the Carter Family, and Bill Boyd, screen&#8217;s singing
cowboy.&nbsp; Ford Rush was emcee.
</small></small></p><p><small><small>1943 February 20, BB, p. 65.&nbsp; News Notes.&nbsp; A fresh and arresting
proof of the tremendous popularity of country-type entertainment, even
in the nation&#8217;s big cities was afforded last Sunday (7), when J. L. Frank
presented a jamboree at the auditorium of Cincinnati&#8217;s Music Hall.&nbsp;
The bill boasted many top folk-tune names, including Roy Acuff, Ernest
Tubb, the Carter Family, Bill Boyd and many others &#8230; .
</small></small></p><p><small><small>With the shellac situation in the process of easing up slightly, Bluebird
has come out with the second country-tune release in less than a month.&nbsp;
It is a Carter Family coupling &#8211; &#8220;Why Do You Cry Little Darling?&#8221; backed
by &#8220;Lonesome Homesick Blues.&#8221;
</small></small></p><p><small><small>1943 July 24, BB, p. 68.&nbsp; The ban on pleasure driving having closed
down Brendel&#8217;s Manor Park near Baltimore, the city and country folk in
that Maryland area will again be able to see and hear their favorite Western
performers.&nbsp; Carlin&#8217;s Park, located right in Baltimore, is bringing
in the Western headliners for the first time.&nbsp; Jolly Joyce Theatrical
Agency &#8230; is spotting the attractions at Carlin&#8217;s. &#8230; Successive Sundays
during the summer will bring in the Carter Family of Virginia, the Hoosier
Hot Shots, Frank Luther, and the Girls of the Golden West.

(Bluebird) &#8220;The Wave on the Sea&#8221; &#8211; FT; V.&nbsp; &#8220;The Rambling Boy&#8221; &#8211; FT;
V.&nbsp; Bringing back the Carter Family on the waxes means the stimulation
of real interest in such folk sides, the family troupe being one of the
most popular in the field for this form of musical entertainment.&nbsp;
Accompanied by guitar and their auto-harp strummer, the mixed family voices
hit a wide mark with both of these &#8220;sad&#8221; hillbilly songs by A. P. Carter.&nbsp;
&#8220;The Wave on the Sea&#8221; is the saga of the sailor lad who is swallowed up
by the sea and the ship that never got to the shore.&nbsp; &#8220;The Rambling
Boy,&#8221; which strikes a similar lyrical strain, tells of the tragic life
and ending of the homeless and misguided waif.&nbsp; Both sides exceedingly
rich in music box appeal, particularly where the older folks are attracted
to the machines.

</small></small></p><p><small><small>1944 October 21, BB, p. 65.&nbsp; Nat Vincent, Pacific Coast representative
for Peer International, Hollywood, goes on record with praise for the whole-hearted
co-operation, the boys and gals in the folk music field are giving one
another in helping out on recorded tunes. &#8230; The same co-operative spirit
was shown on &#8230; the Carter Family&#8217;s &#8220;I&#8217;m Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes&#8221;
and others. &#8230; .
