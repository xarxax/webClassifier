<h1>Thomas Edward Brown 1830-1897</h1>

<p><img src="teb/teb1.jpg" alt="T. E. Brown - the schoolmaster" width=115 height=155 align=left hspace=5> 
  This brief life is based on that by W. Cubbon <i>A Book of Manx Poetry</i> Manx 
  Language Society 1913<br>
  The third son of the <a href="../../fulltext/worthies/p034.htm">Rev.Robert Brown</a> 
  and Dorothy Thompson, and younger brother of the eminent Baptist divine, the 
  Rev. Hugh Stowell Brown. Born in New Bond Street, Douglas. Educated partly in 
  the parish school at Braddan and partly by his father. At the age of 15 he went 
  to <a href="../../towns/castltwn/kwc.htm">King William's College</a>. In 1847 
  he won the second prize for a poem, the first prize having been won by F. W. 
  Farrar, afterwards Canon Farrar (author of "Eric, or Little by Little"), who 
  was at King William's College at the same time. He secured several valuable 
  successes at both the College and later at Oxford. In 1854 he obtained the highest 
  academic honour, that of a Fellowship at Oriel. He was Vice-Principal of King 
  William's College from 1855 to 1861 when he became headmaster of the Crypt Grammar 
  School, Gloucester. In 1863 he was appointed second master of Clifton College, 
  where he spent nearly 30 years. He repaired to his beloved homeland in 1892, 
  and took up residence in Ramsey. A bust in marble, carved by a Manx sculptor, 
  Swinnerton, stands in the hall of the Douglas Public Library &#91;now in Bay 
  Room Manx Museum&#93;. He published several volumes of verse, the first being 
  ' Betsy Lee, and other Poems," in 1881,and the whole were collected and published 
  in one volume shortly after his <a href="../../mquart/mq28057.htm#59">death 
  on a visit to Clifton</a>. Later, his letters to a number of friends were also 
  collected and published. Although a great quantity of his verse is in the Manx 
  dialect, he is increasingly being recognised as taking high rank among the masters 
  of English poetic literature.</p>

<p>Time however has not dealt well with T.E.Brown - although highly
regarded, especially on the Island, at the turn of the Century, he is
now little read. Samuel Norris accounts for this by Brown's use of
the Anglo-Manx Dialect and his rather late start as a Poet. There was
always some undercurrent of suspicion by the native Manx that he was
'mocking' them in some way.</p>

  E. Brown was certainly one of the great letter writers among the poets. In his 
  letters we find himself, his vivid personality, his large-heartedness and knowledge 
  of human nature, his keen sense of humour, kits Joy in beauty, and his deep 
  religious feeling. Mr. Irwin's collection is a cherished possession of all lovers 
  of the Poet, and makes them long for more.</i> (Sophie Morrison)<br>
