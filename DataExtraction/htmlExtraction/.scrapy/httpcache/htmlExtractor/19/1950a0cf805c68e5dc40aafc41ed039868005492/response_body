<DT><font size="+1">M</font>Y head, my heart, mine eyes, my life, nay more,
<DT>My joy, my magazine, of earthly store,
<DT>If two be one, as surely thou and I,
<DT>How stayest thou there, whilst I at Ipswich lie?
<DT>So many steps, head from the heart to sever,
<DT>If but a neck, soon should we be together.
<DT>I, like the Earth this season, mourn in black,
<DT>My Sun is gone so far in's zodiac,
<DT>Whom whilst I 'joyed, nor storms, nor frost I felt,
<DT>His warmth such fridged colds did cause to melt.
<DT>My chilled limbs now numbed lie forlorn;
<DT>Return; return, sweet Sol, from Capricorn;
<DT>In this dead time, alas, what can I more
<DT>Than view those fruits which through thy heart I bore?
<DT>Which sweet contentment yield me for a space,
<DT>True living pictures of their father's face.
<DT>O strange effect! now thou art southward gone,
<DT>I weary grow the tedious day so long;
<DT>But when thou northward to me shalt return,
<DT>I wish my Sun may never set, but burn
<DT>Within the Cancer of my glowing breast,
<DT>The welcome house of him my dearest guest.
<DT>Where ever, ever stay, and go not thence,
<DT>Till nature's sad decree shall call thee hence;
<DT>Flesh of thy flesh, bone of thy bone,
<DT>I here, thou there, yet both but one.

<dt><font size="+1">I</font>F ever two were one then surely we.
<dt>If ever man were loved by wife, then thee;
<dt>If ever wife were happy in a man,
<dt>Compare with me, ye women, if you can.
<dt>I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold
<dt>Or all the riches that the East doth hold.
<dt>My love is such that rivers cannot quench,
<dt>Nor aught but love from thee give recompense.
<dt>Thy love is such I can no way repay,
<dt>The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.
<dt>Then while we live, in love let's so perservere
<dt>That when we live no more, we may live ever.

<UL><DL><P>
<dt><font size="+1">T</font>o sing of wars, of captains, and of kings,
<dt>Of cities founded, commonwealths begun,
<dt>For my mean pen are too superior things:
<dt>Or how they all, or each, their dates have run;
<dt>Let poets and historians set these forth,
<dt>My obscure lines shall not so dim their work.<P>
<dt>But when my wondering eyes and envious heart
<dt>Great Bartas' sugared lines do but read o'er,
<dt>Fool I do grudge the Muses did not part
<dt>'Twixt him and me that overfluent store;--
<dt>A Bartas can do what a Bartas will,
<dt>But simple I according to my skill.<P>
<dt>From school-boys tongues no rhetoric we expect,
<dt>Nor yet a sweet consort from broken strings,
<dt>Nor perfect beauty where's a main defect:
<dt>My foolish, broken, blemished Muse so sings;
<dt>And this to mend, alas, no art is able,
<dt>'Cause nature made is so, irreparable.<P>
<dt>Nor can I, like that fluent, sweet-tongued Greek
<dt>Who lisped at first, in future times speak plain;
<dt>By art he gladly found what he did seek--
<dt>A full requitl of his striving pain.
<dt>Art can do much, but this maxim's most sure:
<dt>A weak or wounded brain admits no cure.<P>
<dt>I am obnoxious to each carping tongue
<dt>Who says my hand a needle better fits.
<dt>A poet's pen all scorn I should thus wrong;
<dt>For such despite they cast on female wits,
<dt>If what I do prove well, it won't advance--
<dt>They'll say it was stolen, or else it was by chance.<p>
<dt>But shure the ancient Greeks were far more mild,
<dt>Else of our sex why feign&eacute;d they those Nine,
<dt>And Posey made Calliope's own child?
<dt>So 'mongst the rest they placed the Arts Divine.
<dt>But this weak knot they will full soon untie--
<dt>The Greeks did naught but play the fools and lie.<p>
<dt>Let Greeks be Greeks, and women what they are.
<dt>Men have precenency, and still excell.
<dt>It is but vain unjustly to wage war,
<dt>Men can do best, and women know it well.
<dt>Pre&euml;minence in all and each is yours--
<dt>Yet grant some small acknowledgement of ours.<P>
<dt>And oh, ye high flownquills that soar the skies,
<dt>And ever with your prey still catch your praise,
<dt>If e'er you deign these lowly lines your eyes,
<dt>Give thyme or parsley wreath; I ask no bays.
<dt>This mean and unrefin&eacute;d ore of mine
<dt>Will make your glistening gold but more to shine.

<UL><DL><P>
<dt><font size="+1">W</font>HEN I behold the heavens as in their prime,
<dd> And then the earth, though old, still clad in green,
<dt>The stones and trees insensible of time,
<dd> Nor age nor wrinkle on their front are seen;
<dt>If winter come, and greenness then doth fade,
<dt>A spring returns, and they're more youthful made.
<dt>But man grows old, lies down, remains where once he's laid.
<dt>By birth more noble than those creatures all,
<dd> Yet seems by nature and by custom cursed--
<dt>No sooner born but grief and care make fall
<dd> That state obliterate he had at first;
<dt>Nor youth, nor strength, nor wisdom spring again,
<dt>Nor habitations long their names retain,
<dt>But in oblivion to the final day remain.
<dt>Shall I then praise the heavens, the trees, the earth,
<dd> Because their beauty and their strength last longer?
<dt>Shall I wish there or never to had birth,
<dd> Because they're bigger and their bodies stronger?
<dt>Nay, they shall darken, perish, fade, and die,
<dt>And when unmade so ever shall they lie;
<dt>But man was made for endless immortality.

<H2><IMG  SRC="marker2.gif"><I><A NAME="5"> <font color="#004080">In Memory of my Dear Grandchild Anne Bradstreet, who deceased June 20, 1699, being Tree Years and Seven Months Old</font></A></I></H2>
<UL><DL><P>
<dt><font size="+1">W</font>ITH troubled heart and trembling hand I write.
<dt>The heavens have changed to sorrow my delight.
<dt>How oft with dissappointment have I met
<dt>When I on fading things my hopes have set.
<dt>Experience might 'fore this have made me wise
<dt>To value things according to their price.
<dt>Was ever stable joy yet found below?
<dt>Or perfect bliss without mixture of woe?
<dt>I knew she was but as a withering flower,
<dt>That's here today, perhaps gone in an hour;
<dt>Like as a bubble, or the brittle glass,
<dt>Or like a shadow turning, as it was.
<dt>More fool, then, I to look on that was lent
<dt>As if mine own, when thus impermanent.
<dt>Farewell, dear child; thou ne'er shalt come to me,
<dt>But yet a while and I shall go to thee.
<dt>Meantime my throbbing heart's cheered up with this--
<dt>Thou with thy Savior art in endless bliss.
