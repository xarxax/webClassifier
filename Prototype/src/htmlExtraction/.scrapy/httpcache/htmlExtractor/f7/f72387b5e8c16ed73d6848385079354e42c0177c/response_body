<b>The Audited Heart</b><br>&#160;<br> 

Words went up to the front and fought and were wounded<br> 
And died and returned home and were paralyzed - <br> 
The slippery survivors parsed together so that we may listen<br> 
To their swords<br>&#160;<br> 

The clatter<br>&#160;<br> 

That's where the teeth are, not in the mouth<br> 
But in the hand, stretching out for the heart behind it<br> 
This cage of holy acceptance<br>&#160;<br> 

The race to the bottom of that red place<br> 
Snake, that thing, that turns there<br> 
Settled under the chest because there is only war here<br>&#160;<br> 

Violence on the coast<br> 
In the corridors<br> 
The country designing itself, vacant and threatening<br> 
Without need to measure the space between this word<br> 
And my last<br>&#160;<br> 

The present grows smaller and smaller<br> 
As the future grows larger and larger<br> 
The Australian's book was written<br> 
Following an oath taken never to write<br> 
Again. Everything<br> 
Had too much importance,<br> 
Too little<br>&#160;<br> 

I do not want to rest my fate on the ordinary,<br> 
On security - I want to talk to everyone!<br>&#160;<br> 

But God is not a parent<br> 
Not a mother or a father<br> 
And you must also look beyond my voice<br> 
To hear my voice authentically<br>&#160;<br> 

Even I, who did it, must search for evidence of what I did -<br> 
So tired that there is no occasion I will rise to<br> 
Nothing intimate in my movements towards the world<br> 
I cannot rest on my own hand<br>&#160;<br> 

Beauty, even of clouds, alerts me<br> 
To the partiality of the flower<br> 
I have held the smallest man's hands<br> 
The strength still in them, of a giant<br>&#160;<br> 

And<br> 
Raising my laugh to the level of a physical characteristic<br> 
Say: Don't be restless with others' love<br> 
For these organs, these unreliable means of detection<br> 
Are the very ones which find the major violations<br>&#160;<br> 

Like that three-eyed fish running<br> 
In the river behind our homes<br>&#160;<br>&#160;<br>


<b>Spies</b><br>&#160;<br> 

Six unknown named agents appeared to me with paper plots<br> 
Of the sea-floor<br>&#160;<br> 

Asking, What did you see from the satellite?<br> 
That we have reduced truth down to steam?<br>&#160;<br> 

On your side of the ocean a bargain was struck<br> 
To keep to the clock which kept old hours, to laugh<br> 
at beggars, to collect antiques and to spit<br> 
at stones<br>&#160;<br> 

Startling and for the record I could only reply candidly<br> 
That if there is in fact no excuse<br> 
For not doing not what you can do<br> 
But rather the exact right thing<br> 
Then my life until now has been useless<br> 
And no amount of surveillance is likely to produce<br> 
The clean cut of a line or even the expected<br> 
Disobedience of the unavoidable self -<br>&#160;<br> 

And just like a dream the spies floated away, telling nothing. . . <br>&#160;<br> 

<br>&#160;<br> 

<b>The Story Of Someone Who Knows Nothing</b><br>&#160;<br> 

Betraying no journeys, what might be is visible from here<br> 
The colours as new as the ones you see all the time<br>&#160;<br> 

I am horrified by the fact that I am not in a war<br> 
(and there are wars)<br>&#160;<br> 

Do I want an epoch to happen<br> 
So that my poetry may have some place to suffer<br>&#160;<br> 

And become golden?<br>&#160;<br>&#160;<br>

<b>Chapter One As It Might Have Been Written</b><br>&#160;<br> 

Cancer doesn't try to be relevant, nor does trashy television.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;<br> 
And in truth, it's only people who can attempt such things<br>&#160;<br> 

Was it today or another day I saw the man with no nose<br> 
With a cathedral of unwanted flesh growing on top of his head<br> 
The sun's hatred of that faraway object moving to and from<br> 
Its old caress<br>&#160;<br> 

Finding the one cell in his body to love, transform<br> 
And multiply in its own image<br>&#160;<br> 

He was relevant<br>&#160;<br> 

The red wet mass where his nose had been<br> 
The purple black clump of cancer sliding down the back of his<br> 
Skull<br>&#160;<br> 

Old<br> 
And because of that a different choice of death?<br>&#160;<br> 

I am the worst of things, a poet<br> 
Who has grown a shell, who lives among riches, drinks<br> 
Wine and casts a net widely.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;<br>&#160;<br> 

Do snails sleep?<br>&#160;<br> 

There is a bad trend in politics to speak badly<br> 
And in platitudes<br>&#160;<br> 

It is possible to say:<br> 
Three-quarters of the world's people<br> 
Without making a fool of yourself<br>&#160;<br> 

We have managed to compare a leg with a bowl of noodles<br> 
With an ocean liner with a tree<br> 
With a plastic figure of a famous person<br> 
With a porcelain figurine of the same thing<br> 
And still not panic<br>&#160;<br> 

I have to resist the urge to panic<br>&#160;<br> 

To rush. . . <br>&#160;<br>&#160;<br>


<b>Being Watched By An Audience</b><br>&#160;<br> 

There was the period when my throat stopped<br> 
Just a risp - a grating sound<br> 
Drugs were selling faster than souls<br> 
And all the good women I knew were drinking<br> 
Or not eating<br>&#160;<br> 

No-one asked me a favour or a question<br> 
No-one asked me why or the way<br>&#160;<br> 

I wondered if people were shy or unconscious<br> 
And none of my messages was returned or replied to<br>&#160;<br> 

It was at this time that I saw her hands, suddenly,<br> 
And realized that if I was a child,<br> 
I would have thought them old - now, they just seemed<br> 
Like the frame, streaky like wood and capable<br> 
Of holding such a scene<br>&#160;<br> 

I am being fascinated by this suffering<br>&#160;<br>&#160;<br>


<b>Mostly By His Maturity</b><br>&#160;<br> 

It was mostly by his maturity that I was impressed<br> 
The liquid floors he poured and still managed to stand on<br> 
He said: Once I was a young man; Now I am an old man<br> 
Behind a reverberating microphone and pretends<br> 
To be excited by nothing<br>&#160;<br> 

I had known him only as a teacher until a certain<br> 
Social Occasion; had never seen him warm like that, the plural<br> 
Smiles, his ready-to-wait-for-my-words eyes, the bed.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;<br>&#160;<br> 

And now many years later the promise:<br>&#160;<br> 

A spider the size of a falling moon swinging upside-<br> 
Down on the web's taut thread, legs curled up like a chandelier<br> 
Swaying caught in the streetlamp's light<br>&#160;<br> 

It is the ugliness of the poet to hang words there<br> 
											Making the spider too<br> 
																heavy<br> 
For the sentence it has written<br> 
Itself which is simply<br>&#160;<br> 

spider hanging<br>&#160;<br> 

I do not want to give up my cigarette and the balcony<br> 
But this night is not for poetry<br> 
But SEX!<br>&#160;<br> 

We have agreed to do it every fourth night until desire<br> 
Takes back what it owns - our will<br> 
Until every night that lies between the fourth and the last<br> 
Begs to become naked and answer -<br>&#160;<br>&#160;<br>


<b>The Poem Of Sappho's Coffin</b><br>&#160;<br> 

Don't speak to me of what's given<br> 
What about what is withheld<br> 
And what is taken away?<br>&#160;<br> 

My unacted upon desires rest without touching my skin<br> 
Like the body of that woman among us - the unembodied one<br> 
Of pure meaning and vengeance<br>&#160;<br> 

Likely she would write The Poem of Sappho's Coffin<br> 
If she had enough flesh to drag up to the end of a pen<br>&#160;<br> 

I don't know!<br>&#160;<br> 

More likely she would stack books all the way from the front<br> 
Door to the back and from wall<br> 
To wall<br> 
To prevent us from entering her house<br>&#160;<br> 

And this despite her hospitality<br>&#160;<br> 

And despite her hospitality<br> 
My hand is always to her face -<br> 
I look through her garbage -<br> 
I feed her children when she doesn't come home at night -<br>&#160;<br> 

And I don't mind any of this<br> 
Because there is simply too much of everything here<br> 
And she sits among us with nothing<br> 
(though in the evening she is so full of me<br> 
that she looks like a giant golden fruit)<br> 
To be with us she has vacated death and asked all<br> 
To look in the same way upon her sacred face<br> 
And imagined body<br>&#160;<br>&#160;<br>

<b>Fat Rabbits Of Love</b><br>&#160;<br> 

Those whose names we would like to remember<br> 
Describe the discomfort that is so compelled<br> 
By humility<br>&#160;<br> 

The wide-eyed rabbits of love hop after them into destinations<br> 
Unchanged and the defectors from love<br> 
Read poetry on the trains<br>&#160;<br> 

Have you ever seen them?<br>&#160;<br> 

Intent<br> 
On proofreading the world<br>&#160;<br>&#160;<br>&#160;<br>
