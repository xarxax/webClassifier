			<h1>Welcome to Sitia Organic Olive Oil</h1>

			<p>Our organically farmed 
			olive groves lie in the renowned Sitia area of East Crete at the 
			mountain village of Saint Spiridon (Agios 
			Spiridona).
			</p>
			<p>Sitia olive oil has 
			long enjoyed a reputation as one of the world's finest oils (please 
			see the &quot;olive oil awards&quot; page). It is of such high quality that 
			each year the greater proportion of the oil produced is bought by 
			enthusiastic Italian customers and by leading Italian blenders</p>
			<p>Olive oil from Crete 
			forms the basis of the renowned Cretan diet which is often cited by 
			nutrition experts and medical researchers as the secret of a long 
			and healthy life. Certainly it is common to see olive farmers here 
			in their 80's and older still tending their groves and harvesting 
			their beloved trees.</p>
			<p>Our oil is Single 
			Estate, not blended or adulterated, preserving the unique quality, 
			flavour and character of organically grown Koroneiki olives. It is 
			pressed without being mixed with the oil of farmers that still use 
			insecticides and herbicides. When just pressed it is cloudy and 
			bright green, clearing after a month or so. We particularly enjoy it 
			when still cloudy, but adore the oil at all times and with all 
			foods. The oil we sell is the same oil our family and friends eat at 
			table. It is amazing drizzled on toasted bread for breakfast (with a 
			little sea salt), with salads and fish it is truly sublime, and it 
			can be splashed on barbecued pork and lamb with a little lime or 
			lemon juice with stunning effect .</p>
