<p align="center">In 1978, Sandy Frank Enterprises began running a butchered version of
Gatchaman in the USA.&nbsp; Even still, &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot; quickly became
one of my favorite shows.&nbsp; While the censors hacked the show into a (largely)
uninteligable mess, they couldn't wreck the beautiful artwork, stirring music, or the
spirit of the show (Lord knows they tried!).</p>

<p align="center">In the years since, I've collected a bunch of artwork from the three
original series, and the more recent OAV.&nbsp; This site features a load of cels, pencil
drawings, and other types artwork from all of the Gatchaman shows.&nbsp; I hope you enjoy
seeing it!</p>

<p align="center">(This site is under a constant state of construction as I try to get
more stuff scanned, photographed, and screen-grabbed (is <em>screen-grabbed</em> a
word?).)</p>
