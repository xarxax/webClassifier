<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jean-Louis Kerouac: His life was the stuff of which legends

are spun. The son of a printer, he was born in 1922, and grew up

in a mill town, Lowell, Massachusetts. The Kerouacs were French-

Canadian, descended from fur trappers and traders. Even as a boy,

Kerouac knew what he would be: a writer. Athletic, rugged,

handsome, he called himself Jack--after Jack London, and, like

London, his vision of the world was romantic and adventurous. </p>



<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, Kerouac might have remained in Lowell, another kid who

dreamed of glory, if luck had not lent a magical hand. In high

school, Kerouac was spotted playing football by an Ivy League

scout and was recruited to play in the backfield for Columbia

University. </p>



<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The university arranged for a scholarship, and Kerouac arrived

on the Morningside Heights campus in the fall of 1940. Like some

character in Balzac, another writer he admired, the glittering

prewar city lay before him, with all the promise it held for

youth. </p>



<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the world has a way of holding out its treasures-- only to

snatch them away. Freshman year, Kerouac was injured in a game

and sat out the season. According to a biographer, sophomore

year, Jack quit the team and dropped out of Columbia because the

coach kept him on the bench. (Ann Charters, <i> Jack Kerouac</i>, San

Francisco: Straight Arrow, 1973) </p>



<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; America was at war, and Jack joined the Navy. In boot camp,

however, he was unable to take the discipline. One day Kerouac

dropped his rifle and walked off the drill field. He was confined

to a Navy hospital where he told the psychiatrists he was writing

a novel entitled, <i>The Sea Is My Brother</i>. The aspiring

author was given an honorable discharge, with an

&quot;indifferent character.&quot; </p>



<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kerouac returned to New York and lived with an old girlfriend,

Edie Parker, who was studying art at Columbia. Edie was zany--a

free spirit-- and their West End apartment was filled with her

strange friends. Through Edie, Jack met William Burroughs, a

jaded dilettante and morphine addict, and Allen Ginsberg, then a

young poet, obsessed by Blakean visions, who had been expelled

from Columbia for writing obscenities on his dormitory window.

(Years later, in Tangiers, Kerouac and Ginsberg assembled

Burroughs's notes on his drug addiction into a book whose title

Kerouac suggested: <i> Naked Lunch</i>.) </p>



<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kerouac worked at odd jobs and occasionally shipped out as a

merchant seaman. In 1946 he began a novel, <i> The Town and the City</i>.

Written in the style of Thomas Wolfe, the book fictionalized

Jack's boyhood in Lowell and the new world he had discovered

around Times Square and Greenwich Village. He wrote about

hustlers, disillusioned intellectuals, junkies. &quot;The only

ones for me are the mad ones,&quot; Kerouac would later write.

Using a phrase coined on the streets, he called them

&quot;beat&quot;--a term that later epitomized a postwar

generation. </p>



<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1949, at the suggestion of Mark Van Doren, Jack's Columbia

English teacher, Harcourt, Brace accepted <i> The Town and the City</i>

for publication. While he awaited the book's release, Kerouac

dreamed of buying a ranch with his future royalties and inviting

his friend, Neal Cassady, to live with their families on a

commune. </p>



<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cassady was a manic, wild character who had blown into New

York from Denver a few years before. As a youth, he had been in

and out of reform schools for joy riding. Life--to Neal--was

&quot;pleasure and kicks:&quot; Cars, Tea, Sex. Ginsberg was in

love with him; <font size="3">Kerouac described him as &quot;...a young Gene
Autry--trim, thin-hipped, blue-eyed, with a real Oklahoma accent--a sideburned
hero of the snowy West.&quot;</font> </p>



<p align="justify"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Town and the City </i> did not bring Jack the fame he had hoped

for. But he was already at work on a new book, based on what he

called &quot;my life on the road.&quot; Jack had hitchhiked to

Denver to see Neal and had stumbled in alleyways and poolhalls

following his friend through &quot;the sadness and joy&quot; of

his own dark world.&nbsp; </p>



<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But through Neal, Jack had found his theme and his voice.

&quot;We gotta go and never stop going till we get there,&quot;

Cassady had said. When Jack asked where they were going, Neal replied, &quot;I
don't know, but we gotta go till we get there.&quot; It was Neal's frantic
speech and letters--with their echoes

of jazz and bop-- that led Jack to create what he called

&quot;spontaneous prose.&quot; </p>



<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the spring of 1951, Jack Kerouac sat at his typewriter and

wrote, <i> On the Road</i>. He completed the book in three weeks, typing

it on a roll of teletype paper. As soon as he finished, he

informed Neal: The story &quot;deals with you and me and the

road...Went fast because road is fast.&quot; (<i>Jack Kerouac</i>: <i>

Selected Letters</i>, New York: Viking, 1995) </p>



<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jack was pleased by his triumph and proud of the departure he

had made from &quot;previous American Lit.&quot; &quot;I really

wrote a great book,&quot; he assured Cassady in one letter; in

another he promised: &quot;I won't get the screwing Melville

got&quot;--referring to the great 19th century writer who had

labored through life in obscurity. </p>



<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Kerouac's dreams were soon shattered. &quot;I am

completely f---ed,&quot; he told Neal after two publishers had

turned down the novel in quick succession. Jack's own publisher

found the work too &quot;new and unusual,&quot; and doubted a

book &quot;about bums&quot; would appeal to the public. </p>



<div style="float:right; margin-right:30px; margin-left:30px;"><img src="images/jk-tristessa-book-cover.jpg" width="300" height="509"></div><p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following his failure to sell his novel, Kerouac traveled to Mexico City to see Burroughs.
  There Jack wrote poetry, later published as <em>Mexico City Blues</em>, experimented with drugs,
  and fell in love with a Mexican prostitute--a doomed affair he  wrote about in <em>Tristessa</em>.
  (The book was published  in 1960 as a paperback original  since even after he became
  famous, the publishing Establishment treated Jack as a second class writer.)<br /><br />Tristessa was a morphine addict; Kerouac got high with her. The book was a long,
  hazy prose poem in which Jack wrote of her "long sad eyelids" and "Virgin Mary
  resignation." A rooster screamed under the bed in her pitiful adobe. Jack saw himself
  as "wild haired" and "mad" riding in taxi cabs with his love  through the wet
  city streets. "Why are you so sad?" Tristessa would ask him. These were
  angry, bitter years for Kerouac--a time of rejection and despair. </p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in 1954, <i> On the Road </i> landed on the desk of an editor at

Viking named Malcolm Cowley. A well-respected scholar, Cowley had

written a book on American writers in Paris, and he recognized

the breakthrough Kerouac had achieved in language and style. </p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Cowley's suggestion, Kerouac edited the manuscript to make

it more palatable to Viking. According to John Montgomery, the

text was cut in half. Burroughs, Ginsberg, and Cassady were given

pseudonyms to disguise their identities. Kerouac also removed a

number of passages, including one involving Neal's interest in a

pre-teenage girl. When the publisher remained nervous, Cowley

assured them that Kerouac's friends were &quot;not the type of

people who sue.&quot; </p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When finally published in 1957, <i> On the Road</i> was an immediate

success. In <i> The New York Times</i> Gilbert Millstein hailed the book

as an &quot;historic occasion&quot; and praised its

&quot;beauty&quot; and &quot;technical virtuosity.&quot;

Overnight, Jack Kerouac found himself famous--dubbed by the

popular press as &quot;King of the Beats.&quot; </p>


<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a supreme irony that Jack would be regarded as a radical--"a know-nothing
   Bohemian" one critic called him--though his book was a joyous ode to late 1940s
   USA with its raw beauty and wild freedom symbolized by the open road; and
   the characters--American characters--cowboys, farmers, panhandlers--Jack
   met along the way.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But success proved a trap for Kerouac. Instead of growing as

an artist, he reworked the same themes, convincing himself he was

creating a Proustian legend about Neal and his friends. <i> The

Dharma Bums</i> (1958) dealt with the West Coast Beats; <i> Visions of

Cody</i> (1960) was another paean to Cassady based upon taped

conversations in which Neal expounded upon his girls, cars, and

travels. (As Ann Charters noted, Jack's books neglected to

mention &quot;the men in Neal's life.&quot;) </p>
<div style="clear:both;" />
<div style="float:left; margin-right:30px; margin-left:30px;"><img src="images/jk-tst.jpg" width="300" height="509"></div>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the warmed over versions of <em>On the Road</em>, Jack managed to spin out (on
  bennies to be sure) <em>The Subterraneans</em>, the story of his affair with a lithe
  black beauty, Mardou Fox. "The rainy night blooping all over, kissing everywhere
  men women and cities in one wash of sad poetry" Jack began a riff on Mardou
  and maybe their love, " She squats on the fence, the thin drizzle making beads
  on her brown shoulders, stars in her hair...."</p>
  
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The novel was originally set in Greenwich Village but was changed to San
  Francisco to mollify publishers who again feared libel from Jack's real life
  friends--Ginsberg, Corso, Stanley Gould, a local hipster who was always high -- all of whom appear thinly disguised in the book. Jack's magical prose perfectly captured the smoky nights listening
  to Charlie Parker and talk filled dawns of  the "urban Thoreaus" whom Ginsberg
  dubbed the "subterraneans":  Those who "are intellectual as hell and know
  all about Pound without being pretentious."</p>
  
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack was of another world with his lumberjack shirt and drinking bouts in seedy bars.
   There was one occasion when he, Allen Ginsberg and David Amram, a jazz musician,
    spent the evening at Allen's apartment drinking and reciting poems with Buddy the Wino,
    a Bowery bum they picked up off the street.  While Buddy was digging a poem Allen
    read, Jack turned to Amram and said "real quietly:" "These guys are where I get so
    much inspiration from and learn so much from. They are the true poets of the streets."
    (B. Gifford and L. Lee, <em>Jack's Book</em>, St. Martin's Press, 1978)</p>


<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1960s should have been Jack Kerouac's decade. His books

were widely read on college campuses. Young peop<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">le imitated him,
hitchhiking arou</font>nd the country. But Kerouac turned his back on

the flower children he had spawned. &quot;It's politics, not art

anymore,&quot; he complained. </p>



<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, Jack had become reclusive. After
years of struggle, he had</font> <font size="3">finally crossed his &quot;ocean
of suffering&quot; but had not found happiness on the</font> <font size="3">other
side. To the end of his life, Kerouac was ridiculed by the press and</font> <font size="3">attacked
by jealous rivals. In a famous TV interview, Truman Capote</font> <font size="3">dismissed
Jack's work as &quot;typing&quot; not writing. Stung by such comments,</font> <font size="3">Kerouac
turned further away from the world. He lived with his invalid</font> <font size="3">mother--the
memere of his novels--in Florida, trying to repay her for the</font> <font size="3">years
she had worked in a factory to support him. Jack's days were spent</font> <font size="3">drinking
beer and brandy, listening to jazz on his hi-fi. Once, in a rare</font> <font size="3">public
appearance, he dumbfounded his young admirers by expressing support</font> <font size="3">for
the Vietnam War.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Despite his growing popularity, Jack's books enjoyed modest sales and money was often tight for him and Memere. He did not drive a car and there was no telephone in the house. Shortly before his death, Jack complained to Carl Adkins, one of his St. Petersburg pool hall buddies: "All the rich kids buy J.D. Salinger in hardback, and what do I get? Bums like you buy one paperback for half a buck and then let ten of your friends read it." (<i>The 
Kerouac We Knew</i>, ed. by John Montgomery, Fels & Firm Press, 1987) Later, Adkins recalled that someone referred to Jack's time in Florida as "the melancholy years." 
&quot;He wanted to take the pain out of the world,&quot; poet Jack Micheline later said. 
&quot;No one can do that.&quot;</p>
 
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jack remained deeply religious, as he was throughout his life. He combined a mystical Catholicism with--again according to Adkins--"the tenets of 
Buddhism." Whenever Jack heard someone knock religion,  he would say, "Ah, Jesus died for bums like you."</p>


<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jack grew estranged from Neal who was involved in the

counterculture as a member of the &quot;Merry Pranksters,&quot;

a group who drove around San Francisco in a bus painted in

psychedelic colors. When Neal died of a drug overdose in Mexico,

he and Jack had not seen each other for almost five years. </p>



<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, in 1969, the end came for Kerouac. After a night of

heavy drinking, he hemorrhaged and was rushed to the hospital

where he died at age 46. He was buried in the local Catholic

cemetery in Lowell, the city he had left as a boy, filled with

those dreams that took him on the road. </p>
