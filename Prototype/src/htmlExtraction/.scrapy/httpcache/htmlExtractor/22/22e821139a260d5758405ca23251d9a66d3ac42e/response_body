All in green went my love riding 
              on a great horse of gold 
              into the silver dawn.

              four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
              the merry deer ran before.

              Fleeter be they than dappled dreams 
              the swift sweet deer 
              the red rare deer.

              Horn at hip went my love riding 
              riding the echo down 
              into the silver dawn.

              four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
              the level meadows ran before.

              Softer be they than slippered sleep 
              the lean lithe deer 
              the fleet flown deer.

              Four fleet does at a gold valley 
              the famished arrows sang before.

              Bow at belt went my love riding 
              riding the mountain down into the silver dawn.

              four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
              the sheer peaks ran before.

              Paler be they than daunting death 
              the sleek slim deer 
              the tall tense deer.

              Four tall stags at a green mountain 
              the lucky hunter sang before.

              All in green went my love riding 
              on a great horse of gold 
              into the silver dawn.

              four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
              my heart fell dead before.</div>

E. E. Cummings is important to me and maybe to you too.  But you don't get to read "All in green my love went riding" today because monetizing his <i>products</i> sixty years after his death is more important to W W Norton, who sent me a copyright infringement notice for trying to show you this poem.  
</strong>
</p>

<p>
Copyright is harmful and counterproductive and it is strangling our culture and progress.  No one has a natural right to own an idea.  Owning ideas is intuitively absurd.  And copyright holders do not own their ideas exactly.  They have been granted a <i>temporary monopoly</i> on reproduction, in order to encourage artists to produce works of value to us all.  Or it used to be temporary, anyway.  The original Copyright Act on 1790 set the duration to 14 years, with the right of renewal for one additional 14 year term if the author was still alive.  If that reasonable term was still in effect, works created before 1988 would all be in the public domain now (2012).  Can you imagine a world where everything by The Beatles was in the public domain by now? It's easy if you try.
