<B><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;If they tell
you it is obscene, they will say truly.&nbsp; I believe there
was something in Pompeian art of this terrible and soul-tearing
obscenity. But then, since obscenity is the truth of our passion
today, it is the only stuff of art .... in this combination of
blaze, and violent mechanized rotation and complete involution,
and ghastly, utterly mindless human intensity of sensational extremity,
you have made a real and ultimate revelation.&quot;</FONT></B></P>

   COLOR="#993366">: </FONT>Lawrence's vision of the relatedness
  of man and nature echoes that of deep ecologists. He idealizes
  a time -- as he imagined the era of the ancient Etruscans to
  have been -- when humans were at home with nature, unafraid of
  participating in its ecstasy or dissolution, and participants
  in a &quot;free-breasted naturalness and spontaneity.&quot; Here
  isan essay which (although not mentioning DHL)&nbsp; reveal the
  similarities between DHL's thought and that of present-day naturalists:

  Frieda Lawrence's book on her life with DHL. </A>Lawrence was
  totally dedicated to, and dependent on, his wife, although the
  shocking violence of their spats included both verbal abuse and
  &quot;thumping.&quot; See also the summary of <A HREF="http://www.bookwire.com/bbr/life/V2.7/d-h-lawrence.html">Brenda
  Maddox's recent book on Lawrence and&nbsp; Frieda (<I>The Story

  <LI><A HREF="http://www.buffnet.net/~starmist/kmansfld/kmansfld.htm">Katherine
  Mansfield </A>witnessed one such &quot;thumping,&quot; and its
  aftermath. Mansfield, with her husband, <B>John Middleton Murry</B>,
  visited DHL and Frieda in Cornwall in 1915. DHL had wanted these
  fellow writers to help him create a utopian literary community,
  RANANIM. The visit did not end happily, and Murry, with whom
  Lawrence wanted to establish a blood-brotherly relationship,
  became a model for Gerald Crich in <I>Women In Love</I>.
  <LI><B>Dora Carrington</B> was a painter with whom Lawrence was
  acquainted through his connections with the Bloomsbury intellectuals
  and artists. He had contempt for what he thought was their over-intellectualized
  approach to life; Carrington despised him. However, she influenced
  another painter, <B>Dorothy Brett</B>, who loved DHL and followed
  him and Frieda to New Mexico, where one of her paintings features
  DHL as a crucified Christ. Carrington and<A NAME="Mark"></A><B>Mark
  Gertler</B> were lovers. The latter was also a painter, and Lawrence
  used his &quot;The Merry-Go-Round&quot; in <I>Women In Love,
  </I>attributing it to the sinister Loerke. Gertler was one of
  DHL's Jewish friends, who usually forgave him his negative portrayals
  of Jews (such as Loerke). &quot;Only a Jew could have painted
  this picture,&quot; said Lawrence of &quot;The Merry-Go-Round.&quot;
