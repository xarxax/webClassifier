        <p><font face="Arial">I wounded your lover in a duel. But
        you are laughing about it because you are wearing your
        scarlet dress. And because, unfaithful as you are, you
        have replaced him with the scene shifter. You would have
        paid for your crime had the hairdresser not been your
        accomplice as the two of you so grotesquely disfigured my
        face. One beautiful morning, however, I shall take my
        revenge. The ceiling won't be as awfully low then as it
        is now, and there won't be as many dead birds painted on
        it.</font></p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p><font face="Arial">I came upon you as your new lover
        gave you a lovely little box. But it wasn't a box: it was
        a book; and it wasn't your lover &#150; it was me who
        gave you a box of watercolors in the colors of the
        rainbow.</font></p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p><font face="Arial">When, from far away, I noticed my
        rival who stood motionless, awaiting me on the beach, I
        began to doubt whether it was really him or perhaps my
        horse or Gertrudis. As I came closer, I noticed that it
        was a gigantic phallus of stone that had been erected
        there ages and ages ago. Its shadow covered half the sea,
        and there was an undecipherable inscription in its base.
        I bent down to copy the inscription, but only my umbrella
        was there, open in the burning sand before me. Without
        any trace of ship or cloud, a pair of gigantic gloves
        were floating in the sea. The gloves worn by the
        mysterious monster that pursues you at night under the
        plane trees along the beach.</font></p>

        behind the lilacs</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A thousand pink wings covered up
        the sky. Doors and windows were closed, and flags and
        pennants fluttered at each street corner. The oval shadow
        escaped up the street with horrifying majesty. The next
        morning, all the statuettes of saints in the parish had
        been decapitated.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Boys and girls from my village,
        their pallid nudity barely concealed under tender gauze
        of subtle colors, played on the plaza at night. Their
        voice resounds there as in a cellar, and birds are
        gathering to explore the depth of the bluish ponds of
        their eyes with their beaks. The other day I tried to
        join them in play by imitating the voice with a
        megaphone; but the boys, girls and birds turned to
        shadows among shadows. Before me, between the deserted
        plaza and the sky, a wire spiral rose, tragic and
        treacherous.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial">We leaned a can overflowing with
        salt clumps against the dead trunk of the oak in front of
        the boiler maker's house at the end of the lane. We
        tarred two old poles swinging in a gap in the branches of
        a eucalyptus, and set fire to a pile of verse of mine we
        had been unable to interpret. Elvira asked me if I didn't
        want to go gather acorns near the pits. Distracted
        because I was watching her mother soak aprons in
        acid-containing water, and not bidding her good-bye as
        usual at night, I untied the horse, wound a cloth around
        his eyes and got lost in the dense shadow of the trees
        lining the road. The trees from which the glass balls
        containing the fermenting dyes are suspended.</font></p>

        discovers the world of dreams. More precisely put, he
        discovers the dream as a medium which, far from being the
        opposite of reality, sheds light on how reality is
        constituted in the subject, thereby suggesting that
        language and desire must play a major role in this
