"Well, Mrs. Warren, I cannot see that you have any particular
cause for uneasiness, nor do I understand why I, whose time is of
some value, should interfere in the matter.  I really have other
things to engage me."  So spoke Sherlock Holmes and turned back
to the great scrapbook in which he was arranging and indexing
some of his recent material.
</P><P>
But the landlady had the pertinacity and also the cunning of her
sex.  She held her ground firmly.
</P><P>
"You arranged an affair for a lodger of mine last year," she
said--"Mr. Fairdale Hobbs."
</P><P>
"Ah, yes--a simple matter."
</P><P>
"But he would never cease talking of it--your kindness, sir, and
the way in which you brought light into the darkness.  I
remembered his words when I was in doubt and darkness myself.  I
know you could if you only would."
</P><P>
Holmes was accessible upon the side of flattery, and also, to do
him justice, upon the side of kindliness.  The two forces made
him lay down his gum-brush with a sigh of resignation and push
back his chair.
</P><P>
"Well, well, Mrs. Warren, let us hear about it, then.  You don't
object to tobacco, I take it?  Thank you, Watson--the matches!
You are uneasy, as I understand, because your new lodger remains
in his rooms and you cannot see him.  Why, bless you, Mrs.
Warren, if I were your lodger you often would not see me for
weeks on end."
</P>

"No doubt, sir; but this is different.  It frightens me, Mr.
Holmes.  I can't sleep for fright.  To hear his quick step moving
here and moving there from early morning to late at night, and
yet never to catch so much as a glimpse of him--it's more than I
can stand.  My husband is as nervous over it as I am, but he is
out at his work all day, while I get no rest from it.  What is he
hiding for?  What has he done?  Except for the girl, I am all
alone in the house with him, and it's more than my nerves can
stand."
</P><P>
Holmes leaned forward and laid his long, thin fingers upon the
woman's shoulder.  He had an almost hypnotic power of soothing
when he wished.  The scared look faded from her eyes, and her
agitated features smoothed into their usual commonplace.  She sat
down in the chair which he had indicated.
</P><P>
"If I take it up I must understand every detail," said he.  "Take
time to consider.  The smallest point may be the most essential.
You say that the man came ten days ago and paid you for a
fortnight's board and lodging?"
</P><P>
"He asked my terms, sir.  I said fifty shillings a week.  There
is a small sitting-room and bedroom, and all complete, at the top
of the house."
</P><P>
"Well?"
</P><P>
"He said, 'I'll pay you five pounds a week if I can have it on my
own terms.'  I'm a poor woman, sir, and Mr. Warren earns little,
and the money meant much to me.  He took out a ten-pound note,
and he held it out to me then and there.  'You can have the same
every fortnight for a long time to come if you keep the terms,'
he said.  'If not, I'll have no more to do with you.'
