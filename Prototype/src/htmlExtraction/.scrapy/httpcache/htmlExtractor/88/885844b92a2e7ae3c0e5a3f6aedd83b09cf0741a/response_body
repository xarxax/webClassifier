              The Freshly-made Soul</B> </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">              by            <A href="mailto:matt.smaus@excite.com">Matt Smaus</A> </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">            <B>Abstract</B> </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">John Keats led a short, tormented
              life marked by great despair, obsessive and unconsummated love,
              and apparent poetic
              failure. Nonetheless and perhaps on account of this, he has since
              become possibly the most memorable and resounding poet of the Romantic
              period. &quot;Ode to Psyche&quot; followed upon a tumultuous period
              of internal conflicts and resolutions within the poet in which
              relatively few actual poems were produced. Its remarkable emergence
              heralded in the more famous odes that are considered now some of
              his finest work. &quot;Psyche&quot; is important as a stepping-stone
              piece, as the poem that squared away all his conflicting emotions
              and rose victoriously out of disillusionment and desperation to
              make sense of his pain. It tied up the loose ends of a very dark
              stage of his life, an amazing feat of finding peace among paradox,
            and cleared the slate for the rebirth of inspiration, with a vengeance. </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">            <B>Publication and Pre-Productive History</B> </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">&quot;Ode to Psyche&quot; is the first of John Keats'
              great odes, written among a smattering of sonnets between April
              21 and 30, 1819. He was living at the time in Wentworth Place,
              the house of Charles Brown at Hampstead, and was just coming out
              of a two-month period in which his poetry had been scarce and often
              uninspired. He had also undergone several profound realizations
              including his new philosophy of life as &quot;a vale of soul-making&quot;:
              an acceptance of grief and pain as necessary to the creation of
              a unique individual. This is particularly relevant to the poem,
              for the 'psyche' signifies <I>the soul</I>. He had read William
              Adlington's translation of Apuleius' <I>Golden </I>Ass, the ancient
              source of the myth of Psyche and Cupid, as well as Mary Tighe's <I>Psyche</I>,
              from which Keats borrowed much of his wording and several of his
            images. </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">The first draft of the poem is lost,
            but in a letter to his brother George dated April 31, Keats transcribed
            the earliest existing version. The paragraph
      immediately preceding the poem is quoted in every work that mentions &quot;Ode
      to Psyche&quot;, and is vitally informative for its illustration of the
      state of mind that Keats was in while composing. He writes:</P>
        
          <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">The following Poem-the last I have
            written is the first with which I have taken even moderate pains.
            I have for the most part dash'd off my lines in a hurry. This I have
            done leisurely-and I think it reads the more richly for it and will
            I hope encourage me to write other things<BR>
    in even a more peaceable and healthy spirit. (letter 123, April 31)</P>
          </BLOCKQUOTE>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">The true significance of these
              words is still unknown to Keats at their writing. It is, indeed,
              this 'peaceable and healthy
              spirit' which enabled him to compose the flawless and more famous
              odes that followed. Though &quot;Psyche&quot; is not considered
              so flawless, it is an achievement in its own right, a sure move
              with a new confidence, the first under the direction of a new Muse. </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">On May 4 a copy of the poem was handed
            to John Hamilton Reynolds, a good friend who Keats had met in Leigh
            Hunt's literary circle in 1816 and who had printed
      Keats' work in the past. It was this copy that Richard Woodhouse, Keats'
      chief transcriber, copied into his book of transcripts. The differences
      between Woodhouse's version and the one from Keats' letter are primarily
      only in punctuation and generally insignificant, with the most glaring
      being a clumsy adjustment of the line, 'Blue, freckle-pink, and budded
      Syrian' to 'Blue, freckled, pink, and budded Syrian'. This proved not to
      matter at all in the end, for the published version read: 'Blue, silver-white,
      and budded Tyrian'. </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">&quot;Ode to Psyche&quot; was
              included in Keats' second volume of work, <I>Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes,
              and Other Poems</I>, the completed manuscript of which was received
              by Keats' publisher Taylor and Hessey by the end of April 1820.
              The book was published on either July 1 or 3 of the same year. &quot;Psyche&quot; followed
              after the &quot;Ode on a Nightingale&quot; and &quot;Ode on a Grecian
              Urn&quot;, which were preceded only by the three title poems. None
              of the sonnets written at the same time as &quot;Psyche&quot; made
            it into the book. </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">The publisher had changed 'bloomiest'
            to 'brightest', considered a less objectionable substitute to the
            improperly formed word. He also broke up the lengthy
      first stanza into two parts. Keats at this point was in no position to
      bicker with his publisher, desperate for any kind of possible sale. </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">Keats had written Brown that he regarded
            this publication with &quot;very low
  hopes&quot;. It was his last attempt at a successful literary career, and in
  his expectation of failure (his disillusionment was with critics more than
  in his own abilities as a poet) he had already nearly resigned himself to &quot;try
  what [he could] do in the Apothecary line.&quot; Nonetheless, good reviews
  began to pour in, beginning with one by Charles Lamb in the <I>New Times</I> on
  July 19, and continuing through that of Francis Jeffrey in the <I>Edinburgh
  Review</I> in August, to still more in September. The sales of the book were
  very slow, however, on account of George IV's effort to divorce his wife, and
  the resulting clamour that arose from her attempts to assert her rights as
  Queen in London. The press was consumed in every detail of this, and throughout
  the entire summer all book sales were extremely slow. By the time the book
  began to receive any serious attention, it no longer mattered to Keats' future.
  He had grown terribly ill and moved to Italy. The volume's eventual success,
  rather than being significant to Keats' living career, was the beginning of
  his lofty posthumous reputation.</P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext"><B>A Synthesis of Paradox </B> </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">The 'peaceable and healthy spirit' expressed in the letter's
            preface to the poem has to be wondered at. Keats had been grappling
            with
            his lack of inspiration
  for a while before, and the poems he did write, such as &quot;Why Did I Laugh
  Last Night?&quot; were dark and ironic. Keats had also become more and more
  disillusioned with people. Besides the critics' constant slandering, he was
  stunned by the financial fickleness of his friends and the way in which noble
  ideals were so easily voiced and so rarely supported by action. Keats met Samuel
  Coleridge, who had been an instrumental influence to him as a young poet, on
  April 11. Offended by the older poet's egotistic monologue, he wrote of the
  encounter: &quot;I heard his voice as he came towards me &shy; I heard it as
  he moved away &shy; I had heard it all the interval.&quot; His failing optimism
  is evidenced in the following passage from his letter on March 19: &quot;among
  these human creatures there is continually some birth of heroism. The pity
  is that we must wonder at it: as we should at finding a pearl in rubbish.&quot; </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">Keats reacted to this by searching
            for a path of his own, independent from the influence of the people
            he knew, through the difficulties the world
      posed. In &quot;Psyche&quot; he writes: &quot;Fluttering among the faint
      Olympians, I see, and sing, by my own eyes inspired.&quot; Besides signifying
      a solitary search for inspiration, this line makes reference to Keats'
      love of Greek mythology which, though 'faint' to modern eyes, held greater
      spiritual appeal to him than Christian values, and had permeated his poetry
      since his association with Leigh Hunt had begun many years before. The
      goddess Psyche, though, had made only one quick appearance in the earlier
      poem, &quot;I stood tip-toe.&quot; More than being neglected within his
      own work, however, Psyche was a figure who, in Keats' words, &quot;was
      not embodied as a goddess before the time of Apulieus the Platonist who
      lived after the Augustan age, and consequently the Goddess was never worshipped
      or sacrificed to with any of the ancient fervour.&quot; So Keats had a
      fresh diety on his hands, the perfect vessel for the expression of all
      that had been brewing inside him. Specifically, as the embodiment of the
      soul, the goddess Psyche was the perfect representative of his &quot;vale
      of soul-making&quot; philosophy. </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">Keats, in his letter, summed this
            new philosophy up with the question: &quot;Do
  you not see how necessary a World of Pains and troubles is to school an Intelligence
  and make it a Soul?&quot; Keats' life had been stricken with despair for some
  time and had recently worsened with his Love of Fanny Brawne that, because
  he was unfit for husbandry at the time, did nothing more than torment him.
  So, with this new world-view, he could accept all the 'World of Pains and troubles'
  as necessary for his spiritual growth as an individual. Keats says to Psyche
  in his ode to her:</P>
          <BLOCKQUOTE>
            <P align="left" class="bodytext">Yes, I will be thy priest, and build
            a fane<BR>
    In some untrodden region of my mind,<BR>
    Where branched thoughts, new grown with pleasant Pain,<BR>
    Instead of pines shall murmur in the wind (50-53)</P>
            </BLOCKQUOTE>
          <p align="left" class="bodytext">In an 'untrodden region'
        of his mind, unspoiled and fresh, Keats is giving himself completely
                  to whatever this
                  new view on life has in store for him. His 'branched thoughts'
                  reflect the branching away of his 'vale of soul-making' philosophy
                  from the Christian 'vale of tears.' Changing the concept from
                one in which only Christ can save you from the world of pain and
                suffering
                  to one in which the grief is necessary for the creation of a
                soul allowed Keats just the sort of independence and resolution
                he needed
                  to reinvest himself in poetry. He was thenceforth able to find
                  the 'peaceable and healthy spirit' he was searching for with
                which he wished to create his poems. Pain had even become 'pleasant.' </p>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">Keats had been frustrated with the
            state of mind in which he habitually wrote poetry. Such thoughts
            as: &quot;In the height of enthusiasm I have been
      cheated into some fine passages; but that is not the thing&quot; (letter
      123, March 8) are found throughout his letter. He felt that the way in
      which he traditionally 'dash'd off [his] lines in a hurry' had not resulted
      in his best poetry and was quite proud of the way in which he took 'even
      moderate pains' with &quot;Ode to Psyche.&quot; </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">It is an unlikely synthesis of ideas
            that occurs in &quot;Psyche.&quot; The
  stoic acceptance and even appreciation of pain lead to the desired state of
  'leisure' necessary to create some of his finest work. The exalted odes are
  a result of this process, and the often-overlooked &quot;Ode to Psyche&quot; is
  the forebear of these. It is the poem that first brought together all the ideas
  that had been gestating during the preceding period of fertile contemplation
  and faltering poetic inspiration. Keats had discovered that by facing directly
  into his pain and exploring it honestly he could arrive at a peaceable detachment
  from it at the same time that he embraced it. </P>
          <P align="left" class="bodytext">In the midst of his detachment, solitude,
            and independence of thought, Keats was intent on keeping himself
            open to the mysteries that life would throw
      at him, to keep the 'casement ope at night', the soul impressionable during
      the darkest of times, a 'bright torch' lit. By being open to life's mystery,
      accepting and even celebratory of life's pain, he would 'let the warm Love
      in!' He had come to grasp the apparent contradictions as essential to his
      individual development. Confident that his Intelligence was being schooled
      and made into a soul, he happened upon a period of peaceful, inspired poetical
      composition. It would last about three weeks, as Keats' short life was
      marked by constant extremes, but it would allow him a respite from the
      turmoil of his life for long enough to attain some of the finest work to
      come out of the Romantic period. <BR>
