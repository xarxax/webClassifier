Since 1960, the Owners and Instructors of MacIntosh Real Estate School have provided a quality education to thousands of students 
who have gone on to successful real estate careers in Colorado. 
<BR><br>
We have a consistently high success-rate (% candidates passing 1st-time) on the state license exam <i>AND</I>
the lowest <i>cost</i> for the required curriculum.  We train on the techniques and focus of the difficult 
state license exam <i>at the same time</i> as we are providing the <i>complete</i> state-required education.

Look at <i>Many More</i> Honest and <i>Unsolicited</i> Comments from Graduates on Our 
<a href="testimonials.html" target="_blank"><b>TESTIMONIALS PAGE</b></A> About the Value and Personal Interaction 
they got from the Mac.  Here's an example:
<br><br>
<i><b>"I wanted to update you on my passing of the RE Exam.  
Hooray!   

Most of the questions were very close versions of those that you asked in the prep and previous exams.  

I was able to speed through both tests in a total time of 1 hour and 15 minutes feeling confident that 
I was going 
to receive a passing score. I don't think 
I could have felt any more prepared.  

<br><br>

"Before starting the test I had a chance 
to chat it up with the 4 other women that were there.  
They all had gone to more expensive schools and 2 of them were in-class 
courses.  During the exam I was first to finish, 
and noticed the other girls around me were struggling.  The girl 
to the right of me went through the most expensive live 
Kaplan course and was sighing and grumbling the whole time.  
It could not have been a good test for her. 
I am very pleased with my experience with your school and 
will recommend it to others.  Thanks for all of your help."</i> Heather H.</b>

                                             <h5>MAC Real Estate School has never raised our prices in more than 20 years.  (In fact, we've only <i>lowered</i> them several times!)</h5>
But in that time, the cost of paper, printing and shipping for our proprietary education and text/workbooks has quadrupled.  It is no longer cost-effective - nor environmentally sound - 
to produce and mail the big workbooks, so we have discontinued offering our program in workbook format.

All studies and tests are still online and are fully printable from home or work, if you so choose.
