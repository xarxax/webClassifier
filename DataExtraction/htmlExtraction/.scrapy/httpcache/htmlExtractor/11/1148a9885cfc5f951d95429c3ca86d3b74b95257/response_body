<P><A NAME="On Strength Gotten from Others "></A><FONT SIZE="+2">On
Strength Gotten from Others</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">When I was 5 years old I forgot my piece. It
was the annual Christmas program of Macedonia Baptist Church-a
splendid affair-and all of the young Sunday school members had
been given poems and recitations to memorize. I forgot mine. I
remember standing there on stage in my new Christmas dress, trying
not to cry as the church members smiled, nodded and murmured encouragement
from the front row.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&quot;Go 'head, baby.&quot;<BR>
&quot;Say it now, Luc.&quot;<BR>
&quot;Come on now, baby&quot;<BR>
But I couldn't remember, and to hide my deep humiliation, my embarassment,
I became sullen, angry.<BR>
&quot;I don' wanna.&quot;<BR>
And I stood there with my mouth poked out.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">It was a scandal! This fresh young nobody baby
standing in front of the Lord in His own house talking about what
she don't want! I could feel the disapproval pouring over my new
dress. Then, like a great tidal wave from the ocean of God, my
sanctified mother poured down the Baptist aisle, huge as love,
her hand outstretched toward mine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&quot;Come on, baby,&quot; she smiled, then
turned to address the church: &quot;She don't have to do nothing
she don't want to do.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">And I was at the same time empowered and made
free...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">In November of 1984 my beloved husband of almost
30 years died. I am making it because of my daughters, my sons,
my woman friends. When I retreat into my room to just sit and
stare or cry I can hear my mama speak through my four daughters.
&quot;She don't have to act strong if she don't want to.&quot;
And they still love me.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">We talk a lot, these four women and I, but
then we always did. They grew up hearing stories I heard from
mama and aunts and the old mothers of the church. It was, it is,
the way we have continued in this country, passing on our own
and the wider history and culture of America. Not just of Black
America, of all of it, so that we know what life was like among
Black people as well as white ones during slavery time because
we heard and overheard the tales of Ole Miz and what happened
when. It has been, it is, our strength, this talking and listening,
because we have traditionally shared not only the outward cold
and definite facts, but also the inward feeling and meaning of
things.</FONT></P>
