<H3>1.  <A NAME="Introduction">Introduction to this Web Page</A></H3>   
<P>Even with <A HREF="nafta.htm">NAFTA</A>,  human resource managers face a   
 multitude of unique issues when transferring employees from Canada to the U.S. 
    This page provides three massive checklists containing all of these issues.</P>
  
<P>The    
<A HREF="knowus.htm">Law Office of Joseph C. Grasmick</A> is prepared to assist
    HR managers with U.S. immigration permits.  Nevertheless there are other   
related  employment issues to handle.  Although we do not represent clients in
these areas, we share this information with our readers.</P>   
<P>For a list of other professionals who can handle items on these checklists  
  see <A HREF="resource.htm">Joseph Grasmick's Rolodex&reg;</A> or the    
<A HREF="ustrade.htm">U.S. Trade Directory</A>.  For help locating the right   
 experts, we invite you to <A HREF="mailto:jgrasmick@grasmick.com">seek our    
recommendation.</A>  For detailed information on HR U.S. immigration issues, see
    the links on the <A HREF="index.htm">home page</A>.</P>

<H2>2.  <A NAME="Introduction:">Introduction:  Canada to U.S. Transfers</A></H2>
  
<P>  Irrespective of whether the transfer to the U.S.A. is short term or    
permanent, the issues are often complex --- and solutions not quick or easy.</P>
  
<P>  Having said that, this page shows you how you can plan to make transfers  
  effective, cost-efficient and with least hassle to you (the employer), and for
    the transferee.</P>   
<P>  <I>As in any major project, good planning --- in advance --- is the key.</I></P>
  
<H3>Similarities and Differences</H3>   
<P> Canada and the U.S.A. are neighbors and normally good ones - except if we  
  are talking   about a special tariff on shingles or beer, or a Stanley Cup    
series between the Maple Leafs   and the Pittsburgh Penguins!  </P>   
<P>We share a <A HREF="peacepoe.htm">common border</A>, love of the outdoors, 
   BBQ's, common language (well, almost), currency called a dollar, and both    
countries have education and personal taxes!     
</P>   
<P>You will see that in these similarities, the differences are already    
emerging --- and major ones at that!</P>   
<P>The dollar relationship tends to be up and down like a a yo-yo --- although 
   for the last few  years the yo-yo doesn't seem to have had much elasticity
and     has resulted in the Canadian   dollar usually sinking --- from 87 cents
(U.S.),     to 70 cents, before recently creeping up from   the floor to 73
cents (U.S.)     
</P>   
<P>This raises a major issue in determining how and where the transferee should
    be paid. Other compensation and benefit elements which must be addressed   
include:</P>   
<UL>
<LI>health (and dependent) care coverage;</LI>
<LI>life, disability, and other insurances;     
</LI>
<LI>pension, saving plan participation.</LI></UL>   
<P>Likewise, decisions are also required on important life-style elements such 
   as:</P>   
<UL>
<LI>schooling for children; </LI>
<LI> spousal employment;</LI>
<LI>accommodation (in both countries);</LI>
<LI>cultural, church, sport, clubs and other leisure activities. </LI></UL>   
<P>Having got your attention - and perhaps raised your concern as to how to    
cope with all  these issues and elements, now, let's try to put these matters   
 into a logical, cohesive plan.</P>   
<H3>Masterminding The Move-Major Functions</H3>   
<P> We've already said good planning is the key.</P>   
<P>Whether you decide to handle the move inside your company, or to outsource  
  and use a   third party provider, someone must     mastermind the move   and
have overall responsibility for its implementation    (we  avoided the word &quot;execution&quot;
as   that might be what happens if    the  move is not well planned!) </P>      
<P>As the quarterback orchestrates strategy for the football team, so the    
quarterback in cross   border transfers, orchestrates and masterminds the    
totality of the move --- of course working   in concert with you, the employer.</P>
  
<P> In the past, most of the transfers were initiated by large Canadian    
companies who usually   had their in-house HR Department to plan and coordinate 
   such moves.  </P>   
<P>Now this seems to be changing in a number of ways: </P>   
<UL>
<LI>Small and medium size companies have been forced to enter the international
    arena to survive and prosper - particularly with the Free Trade Agreement;  
   
</LI>
<LI>Large companies have continued to decentralize and downsize; their in-house
    HR        capabilities have consequently dwindled, been fragmented or   
dismantled  --- or in smaller companies, simply did not exist.</LI>
<LI>Outsourcing to third party  providers seems to be the &quot;in-thing.&quot;</LI></UL>
  
<P>It is critical that the third party  provider has excellent access to the   
 key  executive/manager   of the Canadian company.  Even with telephones, faxes,
    E-mail, etc., there is no substitute   for periodic face to face meetings,
often     required at short notice.  Such services located in   Buffalo,    
<A HREF="peacepoe.htm">&quot;The Gateway or Bridge to the U.S.A.,&quot;</A> are
    therefore strategically placed to best   handle transfers --- with quick
travel     to southern Ontario or Toronto within an hour (peak   traffic
downtown     excepted!).  While  knowledge and experience of
<A HREF="index.htm">U.S.     Immigration</A> and   employment  arrangements are
essential requirements to     handle transfers, so is a thorough   appreciation
of similar arrangements in     Canada.  Having personally worked and lived in  
Toronto for 10 years until     transfer to the U.S.A. four years ago provides
this background; as   does having     orchestrated the move of a large corporate
office from Canada to the U.S.A. at       that time.</P>   
<P>Whether the quarterback is someone in your company, or a third party    
provider, the role is very similar.    
</P>   
<P>This role is indispensable and should be <I>one person within the company -
    or a company   representative, plus one person in the third party provider.</I></P>
  
<P> This approach (the quarterback appointment) is the most important step in  
  the whole   process towards ensuring that the transferee has a &quot;smooth
move&quot;     with:    
</P>   
<UL>
<LI>a known, individual person to refer to for all aspects, particularly    
problems;</LI>
<LI>assurance of all elements being coordinated in a timely  manner;</LI>
<LI>and in Canadian Institute terms, a transfer that is accomplished &quot;quickly
    and painlessly.&quot;    Note:  They may have used a little &quot;poetic   
license&quot;  here!</LI></UL>   
<H3>Career</H3>   
<P>You will normally only be transferring your best employees in their    
respective areas of skill   whether they be executives, managers or    
professionals.  They must be able to expect equal   &quot;best&quot; treatment  
  from you (the employer) otherwise you will risk losing these key people.   
This     starts with career planning---which some say is obsolete in the world
as it is     today --- but   don't you believe that.   Be open and honest with
the     transferee. </P>   
<P>Give specific details of the terms of the transfer, if possible, or as a    
minimum, guidance as to   the approximate period, plus tasks/objectives to be   
 completed prior to return to Canada.    Identification of the likely next
career     appointment likewise is of paramount importance to   the transferee. 
This may     not always be clear, but some form of undertaking is key to a  
successful move.       
</P>   
<H3>Masterminding The Move-The Detail</H3>   
<P>After a decision has been made as to the length/type of transfer we are then
    in a position to   start designing all the transfer elements.</P>
