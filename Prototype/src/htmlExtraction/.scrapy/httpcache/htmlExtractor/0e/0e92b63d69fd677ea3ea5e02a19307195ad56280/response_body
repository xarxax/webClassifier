<h1><!-- piece title -->Ten poems
</h1>
<br />

<h4><!-- poem title -->Settled in August
</h4>
<p class="poem">
Floyd Atmosphere had his cups repossessed<br />
they were amethyst and the buckweed falls<br />
I think it's arbitrary the poem<br />
shaped by idiots rising like a sun<br />
thinking the universe doesn't get it<br />
Gogo Flam arrived home goose step by back stoop<br />
I'll give the wall everything even blood it's higher<br />
Spodumene Bob presiding draws mouth on glass<br />
a highway to the moon the only bout they'll join<br />
ugh said the centipede it's a classic!<br />
and Monk names tunes by trying to name them<br />
well we'll see but now the loquat is gone<br />
no semblance even but plenty of mirrors<br />
aren't the heroes nervous? psilocybin notation<br />
to outright cry and be ready for the beach<br />
scooter then the cash cow the bulk finagle<br />
I watch TV I'm no longer a Cherokee<br />
just a live impersonation till the ceiling falls<br />
join you then join you in bed maybe<br />
I live in a borrowed multiplicity<br />
my brothers are the smoke<br />
<br />

<h4>Besides Being Overheard</h4>

<p class="poem">The Red Mountain Honor Society wants to see your plans<br />
the oven with additional holes in your filing station<br />
the whole cheese around these parts<br />
so you better sashay off this land<br />
alright travel! get that sleep wool out<br />
I just crave to meet up with<br />
if'n these cow barns measure up<br />
chaw down on tetanus root and sit it out<br />
sposed to be quite a fellow up north but<br />
you don't stack up deuce high down here<br />
still best hold that door for the Cassius of Bar None<br />
a raw turf for old coots the whole country tied in ropes<br />
and gets shot through the pants like some gumption not yet<br />
can drive a nail at twenty paces a bandanna full of doubt<br />
walks off a good ways hollering riders<br />
up to their necks in hot bacon<br />
ready to draw down on this whole tar nation<br />
and I hear Cassidy's waiting<br />
<br />
</p><h6 class="right">3IX00</h6>

<h4>Not Reptiles</h4>

<p class="poem">This one is about clean rooms<br />
a clear light full of brain damage<br />
a bit too clubby at times<br />
get that chocolate off the dolomite<br />
<br />
Coffin? just a handful of microbes<br />
then the walls come in<br />
cornice of tomatoes &quot;never let me go&quot;<br />
no farm not to play catch up<br />
<br />
A moisture of comets to blame<br />
deep in the zone's suffering collection<br />
a bogus Getz in mundane shock<br />
the way blue jeans correct things<br />
<br />
Sob story Toronto tattered tape of<br />
try not to slobber over the Woman in Black<br />
toasties and corn cakes mutilation therefore<br />
pulled out of a machine before you can feel it's paper<br />
<br />
Have you got your helmet? hornet's nest?<br />
view of dove-shooting day at the Bushes?<br />
I was hired to go west but the boats kept snapping<br />
sweating and grey being taken as people<br />
that's PEOPLE<br />
<br />

<h4>A Spot of Frazzle and Then</h4>

<p class="poem">The braincase was loose and the rest saw pie melting<br />
we'd have to come home to the lineaments of fire<br />
a lot of squatting included with the sleeping<br />
I imagine pennants with the clothing closing in<br />
dimity fudge due to silence in the breccias<br />
partial poinsettias they lived on Olive Street<br />
inclined toward wicked pencils we stayed<br />
us jamokes quite worn through and bundled<br />
to blow things up beyond all proportion<br />
and crow in wacky dingle a portion of cheek<br />
dried in detonator the telemetry theater<br />
now the cheese quarry its more than human wails<br />
present time now added it's long past time<br />
to get the gargoyles to descend a history of pokers<br />
then someone up near the ceiling he turns and<br />
silence in the Vanguard silence to bring things to<br />
then someone blew it or is this the copper time?<br />
<br />
</p><h6 class="right">31X00</h6>

<h4>Traced Red Dot</h4>

<p class="poem">Hello I'm Jack Jerk<br />
I live with Molly Ringwald in a hutch<br />
the streets outside the Barleycorn Stretch<br />
they burst it all slims down to a point<br />
a golden gingerale of rockhewn source<br />
buy Grotex it helps your cusp<br />
always thought a corpse would tell me what to do<br />
skin pulling its surface moisture<br />
Barbizon sauce personality like a peanut<br />
just need a new parrot and sink a pressure capsule<br />
grotesque what happens to the lasted soul<br />
a bad mouth liver pills in short bursts<br />
maybe nothing but shirt in strong daylight<br />
a punk trains his fist on the green monkey<br />
it's Bruce Surtees capturing latent death<br />
stacked along contention lines black gleam salt<br />
he's now contented he saw his wrist<br />
rosy featured landschaft grass as a pointer<br />
this all comes from one hand's limited desk<br />
clear before the metal starts flying<br />
<br />
</p><h6 class="right">4IX00</h6>

<h4>An Undue Blather</h4>

<p class="poem">The opportunity to be dull<br />
makes cowards of us all<br />
no way I know to get by with it<br />
blood in the glass down below<br />
a mellotron fixed on futurity<br />
where they like to see a bone twist before it falls<br />
<br />
Basket of a man named Thomas caused all the problems<br />
there are pupils in all eyes growing darker<br />
more familiar as incipient papyrus lessons<br />
the bark on the civil council gone scratchy<br />
browbeaten and loaded with scaffolding<br />
blizzard coming okay? nothing but a bullet's whizzes<br />
and a brightness whittles sympathy from the dimness<br />
<br />
</p><h6 class="right">29IX00</h6>

<h4>Icing at the Corners</h4>

<p class="poem">I came to the planet in the desert<br />
where there are tubes underground<br />
shock tubes Buster Crabbe in<br />
all the dependable serials you ever see<br />
the locked Hitler of elevator fame?<br />
no? pour you lick you date you<br />
an animal farm in my capital fun zone<br />
think we can lap ourselves? Swanny!<br />
the idea was to part myself like hair<br />
give me a rumbleseat and I'll call my double friend<br />
snow diamond chevrons on the pole wall<br />
soon someone will close all your closets<br />
glubglub came the sound of goulash breakup<br />
and we're out on the sound no grist few tears<br />
I can't forget those burlap-covered signs<br />
<br />
</p><h6 class="right">29VIII00<br />
<i>for Dick Gallup</i></h6>

<h4>The Plush of a Negative Cat</h4>

<p class="poem">Blackened fingers on the sterling rug<br />
and you'll find frottage by the stump<br />
it's Hans Dustin and too many other Hoffmans<br />
all gaga or got lemon verbena mainly<br />
imagine all this waiting on one tortured sickness<br />
zoomer babies without the frame<br />
the title the madness in a boobie's eyes<br />
scusa? too much rosemary in the window<br />
sparks from Saratoga the scriptures snowing<br />
I'll never be able to read without turpentine<br />
without stopping to dry my eyes<br />
Saint Bartholomew and the Oobleck standing<br />
hard by Barstow and still pushing<br />
<br />
</p><h6 class="right">29VIII00</h6>

<h4>End Gone Flat</h4>

<p class="poem">The envelope floats<br />
the pull on a bottle<br />
the shoots go up from the orange refrigerator<br />
<br />
I will bring you to the apron door<br />
where all the bicycles were icicles<br />
yeah yeah yeah a sphere<br />
<br />
Touch your toes and cure your corns<br />
my favorite color is bluish<br />
fleet title Beau Humps or such<br />
<br />
Publish a book or a Chevy or a tree<br />
seems the storms have come to forage<br />
the trick is to discover your density<br />
<br />
You know what this is? a gun<br />
the end of a chapter in mid-shit<br />
used to think the rain king was Byron<br />
<br />
Opening a new cigarette to calmness<br />
a zipper is there the bottle is pebbled<br />
a boarded pavilion in the rain dance<br />
<br />
Obstacle meat lobber let's get stippled<br />
Castle Caves on a useless afternoon<br />
the siphon is loose let's try mahogany<br />
<br />
</p><h6 class="right">31VIII00</h6>

<h4>A Dutiful Hardness</h4>

<p class="poem">In the holy hallway of dry slaves<br />
another iced window this one leaves<br />
3 bucks and a synthesizer down a drink<br />
tiptoe on the money a length of garment<br />
swings in the chest hole darkness is had<br />
cult of the Cave of the Not Okay<br />
Olney Street about where I took my presence<br />
believing in the brass of a kindergarten class<br />
heat face under house bush in regard<br />
Sunderland the place of the fossil face<br />
and green tattersall golf spinnaker<br />
cost one disc in a cemetery ditch<br />
suspended by electric flex<br />
blockade of Mars bars in the silly dusk<br />
you know what he just died of? death<br />
somebody else's cigarette a bung starter<br />
hemoplant dialysis oblate straightener<br />
let's not pretend we know our motives<br />
as the plane rose the other one didn't<br />
<br />
