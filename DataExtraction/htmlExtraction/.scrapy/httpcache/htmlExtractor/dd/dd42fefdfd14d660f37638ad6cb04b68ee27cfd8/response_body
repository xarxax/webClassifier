If it succeeds it will change the course of your life and provide you a level of independence (and responsibility) few ever experience. Starting a business, however, is not as simple as snapping your fingers or waving a wand. It takes a lot of hard work and preparation; with an emphasis on preparation. Below are 10 things you will need when starting your business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>A Clear Vision</strong> &#8211; What will set your product or service apart from the competition? Who are your customers and how will you attract them? How will you make money from your idea? You need to have realistic answers to these questions before you invest a single pound.</li><li><strong>Honest Self-Appraisal</strong> &#8211; Everyone likes to think they have what it takes to be a successful business owner. But the fact is unless you are ready to put your business above everything but family your chances of success are not great. Do you truly possess the necessary commitment?</li><li><strong>Market Research</strong> &#8211; Your business won’t have much of a chance if you don’t clearly define your market. Who are your potential customers? How old are they? What is their income level? Do they share your values? You need to determine these things ahead of time.</li><li><strong>A Business Plan</strong> &#8211; Once you are certain you possess the requisite commitment and have answered all the above questions it’s time to turn what you have learned into a plan of action; a business plan. The business plan will be your guiding light going forward.</li><li><strong>Feedback on the Plan</strong> &#8211; Run your plan past those whose judgment you trust. Ask for a critical assessment, not a glowing one. Don’t argue over what they say. Instead listen to what they are trying to tell you and ask for clarification if need be.</li><li><strong>A Willingness to Revise</strong> &#8211; Once you have finished collecting feedback take what you have learned and use it to refine your business plan. These revisions and refinements could make all the difference.</li><li><strong>A Clear Idea of Startup Costs</strong> &#8211; You need to have a real-world idea of just how much all of this is going to cost. You may need to seek investors or you may not. You won’t know until you do an authoritative assessment of costs.</li><li><strong>The Ability to Sacrifice </strong>&#8211; If most or all of the startup capital is coming from your pocket you’re going to have to learn to sacrifice. Give up those mocha lattes and the latest fashions and redirect that money toward nurturing your fledgling business.</li><li><strong>A Way to Filter Potential Employees</strong> &#8211; The last thing you want is to employ trouble. <u><a href="https://crbdirect.org.uk/">This DBS check form</a></u> will enable you to filter out prospective hires that could come back to haunt you.

Watley" rel="author">Joan C. Watley</a></span> | <span class="published">May 31, 2018</span> | <a href="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/category/brand/" rel="category tag">Brand</a>, <a href="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/category/corporate-groups/" rel="category tag">Corporate Groups</a>, <a href="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/category/digital-marketing/" rel="category tag">Digital Marketing</a> |  0 Comments</p><div class="post-content"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most companies have shoestring budgets for marketing and promotion. The entire set up cost, capital expenditure, and operational expenses take out a massive chunk of your promotions fund. Most business owners must do a little business development, marketing, and promotion to advertise their businesses, products, and services. Advertising budgets can run into a lot of money and without financial backing, getting PR media content and advertisements could be out of the question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At such times, it is necessary to find ways to promote your business and get your name in front of potential customers and clients. Promotions of companies are significant for growth and sustenance over the long term. Ideally, owners and employees should spend an hour a day on business promotional activities to get the word out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us look at some ways that you can promote your business.</span></p><h2>Start your Website</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t already have a site, get one made. Most web designers are willing to make customised websites according to your business requirements. These customisations must be according to your font, colour, logo, brand, and content specification. Keep the complete control over the content, images, information, tone, and vibe of the web pages and only allow the designers to make and upload the content. If you are unsure about the content, hire a content writer to write, edit, and work with you to create excellent and high-quality content for your website.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many startups find it difficult to hire web designers and prefer writing the content on their own. If this is the case, then there are many online resources available like GoDaddy, Wix, and Squarespace that host and provide templates for you to populate. These templates can be customised according to your business requirement and fitted with content, images, videos, and links. It may be worth out sourcing a digital marketing agency to manage this task, say <a href="https://www.orbonline.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orb Online</a>, as they specialise in such areas.</span></p><p><img class=" wp-image-28968 alignright" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-src="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/twitter-292994_1920.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="307" data-lazy-srcset="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/twitter-292994_1920.jpg 1920w, http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/twitter-292994_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/twitter-292994_1920-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/twitter-292994_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/twitter-292994_1920-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" /><noscript><img class=" wp-image-28968 alignright" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-src="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/twitter-292994_1920.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="307" data-lazy-srcset="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/twitter-292994_1920.jpg 1920w, http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/twitter-292994_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/twitter-292994_1920-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/twitter-292994_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/twitter-292994_1920-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" /><noscript><img class=" wp-image-28968 alignright" src="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/twitter-292994_1920.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="307" srcset="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/twitter-292994_1920.jpg 1920w, http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/twitter-292994_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/twitter-292994_1920-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/twitter-292994_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/twitter-292994_1920-1080x720.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" /></noscript></noscript></p><h2>Social Media</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next on the agenda is to set up a social media presence. Most people rely on social media and online resources to find information about companies, business, products, and services. Set up Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Google Plus pages for your business and start populating them with content, images, and relevant and useful public information. If any conversations or groups are catering to your product or service, join them and start a discussion about your products or services.</span></p><h2>Business Cards</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business cards might seem a little traditional, but they still work the best. Business card help spread information and contact details about your business and the work you do. If you are part of a startup and wish to promote your business, call your friends, business circle, and family members and meet with them to explain your business. At such times, hand them a business card and a few to pass on to their connections as well. Using thin <a href="https://www.cutmyplastic.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sheets of plastic</a>, like 1mm acrylic, or a high GSM paper are ideal materials for business cards.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brand recall and contact recall is highest when there is a business card attached to the business, brand, or logo. This recall is especially useful when asking for recommendations. The business card can quickly be passed on to generate newer inquiries for your business. You will also want to keep the theming of your cards the same as your other advertising mediums. Services like <a href="https://www.cutmysign.co.uk/">Cut My Sign</a> offer a wide range of adversarial products for your business, no matter the size.</span></p><h2>Set up a Blog</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting a blog under the name of your business will help spread the word about your services and products. Blogs should be useful, well researched and not stuffed with keywords. Most blogs are informative pieces of short articles that help readers with relevant information. Blogs are quick ways to increase brand name through organic search results. Katie from kitchenhome.co.uk, who reviews <a href="http://kitchenhome.co.uk/best-kitchen-bins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen bins</a> agreed that blogs also assist in positioning your webpage and business as an authority site or figure. Authority sites get a lot of returning visitors and inquiries for products and services.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These blogs, mostly, help in brand positioning, backlinking to your website, and setting up your business in a global market. Go ahead and boost all these blogs, images, and other posts through your social media pages, and on your website to gather maximum traffic.</span></p><h2>Advertisements and Videos</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medium-sized companies can afford to make ads for TV and online media, but smaller sized companies might find it difficult to do so. In such cases, it is best to create short animated explainer videos regarding your products, services, and any other activities your business takes part in. If your product or service relies on demonstration to the public, you make short demo videos and post them for free on YouTube with links and embedded videos on your website and social media pages.  Any charitable work, volunteer work from the company, conferences that the company is a part of should be publicized through ads and video campaigns across social media and local business sites. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></article><article id="post-28945" class="et_pb_post clearfix post-28945 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-uncategorized"><a href="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/the-importance-of-it-support/" class="entry-featured-image-url"> <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-src="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/laptop-1385700_1920-1080x675.jpg" alt='The Importance of IT Support' width='1080' height='675' /><noscript><img src="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/laptop-1385700_1920-1080x675.jpg" alt='The Importance of IT Support' width='1080' height='675' /></noscript> </a><h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/the-importance-of-it-support/">The Importance of IT Support</a></h2><p class="post-meta">by <span class="author vcard"><a href="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/author/site487/" title="Posts by Joan C. Watley" rel="author">Joan C. Watley</a></span> | <span class="published">Feb 2, 2018</span> | <a href="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/category/uncategorized/" rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a> |  0 Comments</p><div class="post-content"><p>Businesses, small and large, face enormous challenges with staffing, support, knowledge, training, and technology. Most companies need to increase quality and quantity of sales through their products and services. Improving sales is usually done on shoestring budgets that can hamper growth in the long term. While companies invest heavily in training of their staff, implementing sales and marketing strategies, and increasing customer support, they tend to ignore technical support or <a href="https://www.lms.group/it-support/">IT support</a>.</p><p>Neglecting IT support can be harmful since most modern businesses rely heavily on networks and computer systems to help with their daily operations, and client and customer interaction. Many large companies have dedicated IT departments to help with all IT related issues in-house. Smaller companies do not have this luxury due to smaller budgets and employee availability. This drawback can be taken care of through dedicated outsourced IT support and communications providers.</p><p>Let us look at how your business can benefit from IT support.</p><h2>Data Security:</h2><p>Data security is the most critical aspect of any business. Protecting and securing confidential customer and client data, service data, and product data are incredibly important. Cybercriminals target small and large companies and make them vulnerable. Weak data security and storage strategies could become severe threats to your business.</p><p>IT support ensures that business and banking software is updated, security patches are implemented, and network drivers are secure. Data storage and protection is also taken care of by IT support. Many IT support companies also implement extensive security strategies to protect and secure all business-related data on secure servers at affordable price points.</p><h2>Systems Maintenance:</h2><p>Large and small companies employ professionals to install their IT infrastructure but fail to hire experts to maintain the IT systems. It is not enough to only install IT systems but to also update them regularly. While most businesses provide essential knowledge to employees on updating firmware and software, it is best to have an IT expert maintain, upgrade, and manage all IT systems regularly to ensure safety and security of employees and data. Outsourced IT support also provides secure data management systems and regular maintenance of hardware and software.</p><h2>Lower Cost:</h2><p>Having outsourced IT support can help save costs in the long term and increase revenue and profit margins. IT systems need regular upkeep, and this can be a hefty cost if managed by a single person on the payroll with the company. Outsourcing IT support can help regulate and decrease these costs since most IT support companies offer fantastic packages that include all the support and security needed according to the size and requirement of your business. Ensuring that the IT systems and servers are maintained at lower costs is the need of the day.</p><h2>Regular Monitoring:</h2><p>Monitoring of business performance is hugely essential, especially for companies that rely heavily on online customer and client servicing. At such times, failure in the business network even for an hour would result in a substantial financial loss. IT support helps in eradicating such risky situations by regularly monitoring the system, servers, data, and security certificates. IT support also helps in protecting private banking transactions and data for easy client servicing and customer support. With the help of IT support, it is possible to recover from network setbacks within a few minutes, instead of losing hours of billable work time.</p><h2>Solutions to Technical Issues:</h2><p>Most companies tend to use multiple applications to conduct daily business. Many of these applications develop technical glitches and sometimes can also catch viruses through constant internet connectivity.  Effective IT support and systems experts can help solve these issues with little difficulty. Most IT support companies have exhaustive antivirus software and malware protection to keep your business safe and secure from internal and external threats.</p><p>Immediate IT support helps in saving time, energy, and cost that would otherwise be spent in finding a solution to technical issues that might not be commonly known. Employing experts to tackle these IT glitches and software concerns is an excellent way to solve the technical problems &#8211; whether it be <a href="https://www.gearhungry.com/best-wireless-keyboards-guide/">a </a>wireless keyboard that refuses to stay connected, or a system that can&#8217;t seem to detect a hard drive, technicians can save your business a lot of time, hassle and wasted resources.</p><p>No matter how small or large, all businesses require efficient, pocket-friendly, and reliable IT support. Network solutions, antivirus software, data security, personal and business data protection and security is managed with the help of IT support experts. Proper maintenance and regular upkeep of all hardware and software are essential in improving the bottom line of the company. Ensuring the IT systems in your business are running at optimum levels will help in improving profit margins and sustainability of your business over the long term.</p></div></article><article id="post-28876" class="et_pb_post clearfix post-28876 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-brand tag-color tag-mood"><a href="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/color-brand-affecting-business/" class="entry-featured-image-url"> <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-src="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Choosing-the-color.jpg" alt='How Is The Color Of Your Brand Affecting Your Business?' width='1080' height='675' /><noscript><img src="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Choosing-the-color.jpg" alt='How Is The Color Of Your Brand Affecting Your Business?' width='1080' height='675' /></noscript> </a><h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/color-brand-affecting-business/">How Is The Color Of Your Brand Affecting Your Business?</a></h2><p class="post-meta">by <span class="author vcard"><a href="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/author/site487/" title="Posts by Joan C.

The e-book is simpler to have with you because we carry our phones and tablet devices always with us, but many people still prefer a paper book. They love the smell of the book and the feeling they give them.</p><h3>Reading the magazine</h3><p>Today you don’t even need to buy the paper because many publishers have an online edition of papers. But readings magazines isn&#8217;t skilled that is lost. Many of us like to relax after a long working day by reading news and what is going on in the world. This is the feeling of serenity which online versions cannot give us. While reading online magazines, it is easy to be distracted by advertisements, and others sites and makes it hard to focus just on your article. Also, printed media is more engaging to readers, unlike digital ones.</p><h3>Skill of taking notes</h3><p>Studies have shown that writing notes on the paper are more useful for the retaining of the information, then taping them on computer or laptop. This is because when we write, we are focused on synthesizing the lecture, but when we type our focus is on transcribing every word that we hear. When we write we make a decision what is important to keep, and what is not,  and that results in retention of material.</p></div></article><article id="post-28858" class="et_pb_post clearfix post-28858 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-corporate-groups tag-consulting tag-education"><a href="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/corporate-groups/" class="entry-featured-image-url"> <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=" data-lazy-src="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Save-Money-And-Time.jpg" alt='Corporate Groups' width='1080' height='675' /><noscript><img src="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Save-Money-And-Time.jpg" alt='Corporate Groups' width='1080' height='675' /></noscript> </a><h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/corporate-groups/">Corporate Groups</a></h2><p class="post-meta">by <span class="author vcard"><a href="http://www.tullis-russell.co.uk/author/site487/" title="Posts by Joan C.
