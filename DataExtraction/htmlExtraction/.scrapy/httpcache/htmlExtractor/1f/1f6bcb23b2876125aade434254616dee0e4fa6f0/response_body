        <i><font size="3"><p></font><font SIZE="2">The day was a van-bird of summer; the robin
        still piped, but the blue,<br>
        A warm and dreamy palace with voices of larks ringing through,<br>
        Looked down as if wistfully eyeing the blossoms that fell from its lap;<br>
        A day to sweeten the juices, --a day to quicken the sap! <br>
        All round the shadowy orchard sloped meadows in gold, and the dear<br>
        Shy violets breathed their hearts out--the maiden breath of the year</p>
        </i><p align="left"></font><font size="3">ON just such a van-bird day as sung in those
        lines of the poet-romancist himself I take up my pen to write of &quot;The Country of
        George Meredith.&quot; The country of George Meredith: a fascinating theme indeed! &nbsp;
        For the true Meredithian, there is no living writer so saturated with the spirit of nature
        in England as this rare poet. What other has sung with so vibrant and exultant a note as
        this great analyst and portrayer of men and women?-- who with all his Aristophanic
        laughter and keen Voltairian spirit feels to the core what he has himself so finely
        expressed . . . that nothing but poetry makes romances passable, &quot;for poetry is the
        everlastingly and embracingly human; without it, your fictions are flat foolishness.&quot;
        &nbsp; But what a country it is--how wide its domain, how evasive its frontiers!&nbsp; I
        doubt if any living writer is as intimate with nature-life, with what we mean by
        &quot;country-life.&quot; Certainly none can so flash manifold aspect into sudden
        revelation. Not even Richard Jeffries knew nature more intimately, though he gave his
        whole thought to what with Meredith is but a beautiful and ever-varying background. I
        recollect Grant Allen, himself as keen a lover and accomplished a student of nature as
        England could show, speaking of this singular intimacy in one who had no pretension to be
        a man of science. And that recalls to me a delightful afternoon illustrative of what has
        just been said. Some twelve or fourteen years ago, when Grant Allen (whom I did not then
        know) was residing at The Nook, Dorking, I happened to be on a few days' visit to George
        Meredith at his cottage-home near Burford Bridge, a few miles away. On the Sunday morning
        I walked over the field-ways to Dorking, and found Grant Allen at home. It was a pleasant
        meeting. We had friends in common, were colleagues on the staff of two London literary
        &quot;weeklies,&quot; and I had recently enjoyed favourably reviewing a new book by this
        prolific and always interesting and delightful writer. So, with these
        &quot;credentials,&quot; enhanced by the fact that I came as a guest of his friend, I
        found a cordial welcome, and began there and then with that most winsome personality a
        friendship which I have always accounted one of the best things that literary life has
        brought me. After luncheon, Grant Allen said he would accompany me back by Box Hill; as,
        apart from the pleasure of seeing Mr. Meredith, he particularly wanted to ask him about
        some disputed point in natural history (a botanical point of some kind, in connection, I
        think, with the lovely spring flower &quot;Love-in-a-Mist&quot;--for which Meredith had a
        special affection, and had fine slips of it in his garden) which he had not been able to
        observe satisfactorily for himself.&nbsp; I frankly expressed my surprise that a
        specialist such as my host should wish to consult any other than a colleague on a matter
        of intimate knowledge and observation; but was assured that there were &quot;not half a
        dozen men living to whom I would go in preference to George Meredith on a point of this
        kind. He knows the intimate facts of countryside life as very few of us do after the most
        specific training. I don't know whether he could describe that greenfinch in the wild
        cherry yonder in the terms of an ornithologist and botanist--in fact, I'm pretty sure he
        couldn't. But you may rest assured there is no ornithologist living who knows more about
        the finch of real life than George Meredith does--its appearance, male and fermale, its
        song, its habits, its dates of coming and going, the places where it builds, how its nest
        is made, how many eggs it lays and what--like they are, what it feeds on, what its song is
        like before and after mating, and when and where it may best be heard, and so forth. As
        for the wild cherry . . . perhaps he doesn't know much about it technically (very likely
        he does, I may add! . . . it's never safe with 'our wily friend' to take for granted that
        he doesn't know more about any subject than any one else does!) . . . but if any one could
        say when the first blossoms will appear and how long they will last, how many petals each
        blossom has, what variations in colour and what kind of smell they have, then it's he and
        no other better. And as for <i>how </i>he would describe that cherry-tree . . . well,
        you've read <i>Richard Feverel </i>and<i> Love in a Valley, </i>and that should tell you
        everything!&quot;</p>
        <p>But before we come to Meredith's own particular country--the home-country so intimately
        described in much of his most distinctive poetry and prose, and endeared to all who love
        both by his long residence in its midst-let us turn first to the wider aspects implied in
        the title of this article of our &quot;Literary Geography&quot; series.</p>
        <p>George Meredith as a writer of romance has annexed no particular region, as Mr. Hardy
        has annexed Wessex, as, among younger men, Mr. Eden Phillpotts has restricted his scope to
        the Devon wilds, or Mr. Murray Gilchrist to the Peakland region. In truth, he has no
        territorial acquisitiveness: it would matter nothing to him, I fancy, whether Richard
        Feverel, or Nevil Beauchamp, or Evan Harrington, or Rhoda or Dahlia Fleming, or Clara
        Middleton, or &quot;Browny&quot; Farrell, or any other of his men and women, played their
        parts in this or that country, in southern-England or western or eastern, in Bath or
        Berlin, in London or Limburg. Although the natural background of his English stories is
        very subtly used by him, it is only occasionally the background of specific geographical
        region or of locality; though at times we may find ourselves for a while at Bath, or
        Tunbridge Wells, or Wimbledon (if Wimbledon it be where General Ople had his
        &quot;gentlemanly residence&quot; and was appropriated out of widowerhood by the
        redoubtable Lady Camper), or by Tharnesside, or at Felixstowe, or anywhere east or south
        of Waterloo Bridge as far as the dancing tide of that unforgettable off-Harwich swim in <i>Lord
        Ormont and his Aminta, </i>or that particular reach of &quot;blue water&quot; of the
        Channel betwixt the Isle of Wight and the coast of France where Jenny Denham, on board the
        <i>Esperanza, </i>wakes to the truth that she is to be the crowning personal factor in
        Nevil Beauchamp's diversified amorous career.</p>
        <p>In this series of &quot;Literary Geography&quot; it has ever been a puzzle how to treat
        specifically the country of a famous writer when that writer has wandered far afield, as
        Scott did, or as Stevenson did. It is rare that one finds a novelist so restricted in
        locality as George Eliot or Mr. Thomas Hardy. The former made one great and unconvincing
        venture abroad; but in connection with the titular phrase &quot;The Country of George
        Eliot&quot; the Florence of <i>Romola </i>would not naturally be thought of. George Eliot
        made photographic Florentine studies: she did not herself re-create for us the country of
        Romola, as she re-created her own home-land for us in <i>Adam Bede, </i>or <i>Silas
        Marney, </i>or<i> The Mill on the Floss. </i>And Mr. Hardy is Wessex to the core. Little
        beyond is of account in what he has done, and we can no more readily imagine him writing a
        tale of Venice or of Switzerland than we could readily imagine Dostoievsky or Maxim Gorki
        emulating Samuel Lover or Charles Lever.</p>
        <p>But Meredith leaves one in face of an acuter difficulty.&nbsp; In a sense, he is
        English of the English: there is none living who more swiftly and poignantly conveys the
        very breath and bloom of nature as we know it in England-- above all in Surrey and the
        long continuous vale of the Thames. The titles of one or two books of his verse are
        significant: <i>Poems of the English Roadside, Poems and Lyrics of the Joy of Earth. </i>He
        is, before all, the poet of the joy of life, and none has more intimately brought us
        nearer in delight to the countryside. I know no more winsome book of verse, for the truly
        in love with nature, than <i>The Nature Poems of George Meredith, </i>with Mr. William
        Hyde's wholly delightful drawings: a volume containing little in quantity, but
        superlatively rich in quality. It is enough to add that its contents include the noble <i>Hymn
        to Colour Woods of Westermain, Love in a Valley, The South-Wesley, The Thrush in February,
        The Lark Ascending, Night of Frost in May, </i>the <i>Dirge in Woods. </i>Yet, while this
        is obvious, any lover of his writings will recall that much of what is most beautiful in
        description--rather in evocation, for anything of detailed description, save on the
        broadest canvas with a swift and burning brush, is rare with this master of English
        prose--is in connection with Italian, or French, or German, or Austrian, or Swiss scenery.
        He has made Venice and the Alpine regions more alive with unforgettable light and magic
        touch than any other has done since Ruskin, and in a way wholly his own, supremely the
        Tintoretto of the pen as he is. How, then, in speaking of &quot;The Country of George
        Meredith,&quot; are we to limit ourselves to Surrey or the home-counties?&nbsp; The most
        English of his novels is held to be <i>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel; </i>but the finest
        piece of descriptive writing of nature in that book (and, as it happens, the longest of
        any in the books of Meredith) is not of nature as we know it on the Surrey downs or by the
        banks o' Thames, but among the hills of Nassau in Rhineland and by the clear flood of the
        Lahn where it calls to the forest not far from that old bridge at Limburg, &quot;where the
        shadow of a stone bishop is thrown by the moonlight on the water crawling over slabs of
        slate.&quot;&nbsp; No one who has read (how many there must be who know it almost by
        heart!) the fortysecond chapter of this book--the chapter so aptly named, though with
        double meaning, &quot;Nature speaks&quot;--will be ready to forego the author's right to
        have this riverland and forestland of Nassau included in his &quot;Country.&quot;&nbsp; If
        one of the most deep, vivid, and beautiful pieces of writing in modern literature is not
        to bring the region limned within the frontier of the author's literary geography, what
        value in the designation remains?&nbsp; It is not isolated in beauty, that unforgettable
        scene&nbsp; . . . not even when set with its compeer in the same book, the familiar but
        never staled beauty of that finest prose-poem in English fiction, the famous <i>Enchanted
        Islands </i>chapter or wooing of Richard Feverel and Lucy Desborough (with characteristic
        irony entitled &quot;A Diversion Played on a Penny Whistle&quot;), or with the brief
        &nbsp; but&nbsp; mordant passage given to the tragically ineffective meeting of married
        Richard and Lucy in Kensington Gardens, &quot;when the round of the red winter sun was
        behind the bare chestnuts.&quot;&nbsp; One could companion these with a score, with a
        hundred passages, from the Rhineland of the early <i>Farina </i>to the Alps of <i>The
        Amazing Marriage.</p>
        </i><p>The literary geography of George Meredith, then, cannot be confined to a region or
        scattered regions with definite frontiers, still less to a mere county or two with
        adjustable boundaries: it must be constructed, say, like the shire of Cromarty, which one
        finds in bits about the north of Scotland, or like that familiar &quot;Empire&quot; map
        where the red flaunt of our kinship is scattered over the world with what a famous
        humorist has called an impartial and inveterate zest for &quot;dumping&quot; on all the
        desirable and soft spots.</p>
        <p>Switzerland, from the Bernese Oberland to Monte Generoso; Italy, from the Lombard Plain
        below Monte Motterone to Verona and Venice; Austria, from the upper waters of Lago di
        Maggiore or from Friulian or Carinthian Alp, to hill-set Meran and imperial Vienna;
        Germany, from the Harz to the hills of Nassau and the Rhinelands of Cologne-- (of the
        thousands who invest there in the &quot;Farina&quot; of commerce, one wonders how many
        indulge in or recall the &quot;Farina&quot; of literature, wherein the Triumph of Odour is
        so picturesquely set forth!); France, from the pleasant Vosges or old Touraine to the not
        unguessable &quot;Tourdestelle&quot; of the Norman coast--are not these, with Solent
        waters and the open Channel and the Breton reaches of La Manche and &quot;the blue&quot;
        west and south of Ushant, even to distant Madeira . . . are not all these to be brought
        within the compass of the literary geographer?</p>
        <p>True, it may be urged, these are but swallow-flights into poetry. &quot;A series of
        kaleidoscopic views, however beautiful, is not enough to justify the claim of the literary
        geographer to this or that region, or words to that effect, might be adduced. But the
        secret of the vivid and abiding charm of Mr. Meredith's backgrounds to the tragicomedy of
        his outstanding men and women is just in their aloofness from anything
        &quot;kaleidoscopic,&quot; with its implication of the arbitrary and the accidental lie
        does not go to Venice or to Limburg to write about these places, or to note the bloom of
        local colour for literary decoration; nor does he diverge by the Adriatic or by the
        winding ways of Lahn, so as to introduce this gondola-view of the sea-set city or that
        forest-vision which for English folk has given a touch of beauty to Nassau which before it
        hardly owned in literary remembrance. His men and women are there, for a time, or
        passingly; and so the beauty that is in the background closes round and upon them, or is
        flashed out for a moment, through the magic of the same power which gave themselves the
        breath of life. The same vision which has seen into a Renée's heart or the life-springs
        of a Nevil Beauchamp, or pierced the veils of personality in a Cecilia Halkett (or any of
        the long unequalled &quot;studies&quot; from Lucy Desborough to beautiful Carinthia, from
        Rosamund Romfrey--perhaps Mr. Meredith's subtlest portrait--to Mrs. Berry) or in men of
        passionate life and action such as Richard Feverel, or &quot;Matey&quot; Weyburn, or the
        great Alvan (and here, too, what a gallery of living natures, between the almost grotesque
        extremes of Sir Willoughby Patterne of one great novel and the Dr. Shrapnel of
        another!)--the same vision has noted the determining features and outstanding aspects of
        this or that scene, arid, in flashing a single ray or flooding a long continuous beam, has
        revealed to us more than the most conscientious photographic or &quot;Pre-Raphaelite&quot;
        method could accomplish in ten times the space, or in ten times ten. It is, indeed,
        pre-eminently in these brief outlines of the country in which his imagination temporarily
        pursues its creative way that Meredith excels. A score of instances will doubtless occur
        to the reader, but here are one or two chosen almost at random. I do not allude to those,
        and they are many, which convey solely by awakening an emotion in the mind of the
        reader--not by description but by a sudden terse expression of deep feeling in the midst
        of dialogue or direct narrative: as, for example, a couple of lines in that delightful
        romance <i>Lord Ormont and his Aminta, </i>which so charmed readers of the <i>Pall Mall
        Magazine </i>in the numbers issued from December 1893 to July 1894:</p>
        <p></font><font SIZE="2">&quot;Thus it happened that Lord Ormont and Philippa were on the
        famous Bernese Terrace, grandest of terrestrial theatres, where soul of man has fronting
        him earth's utmost majesty. . . .&quot;</p>
        <p></font><font size="3">I allude, rather, to vivid &quot;asides&quot; such as:</p>
        <p></font><font SIZE="2">&quot;. . . poor Blackburn Tuckham descended greenish to his
        cabin as soon as (the yacht) had crashed on the first wallwaves of the chalk-race, a throw
        beyond the peaked cliffs edged with cormorants, and were really tasting sea. . . .&quot;</font><font size="3"><i> (Beauchamp's Career.)</p>
        </i><p>or,</p>
        <p></font><font SIZE="2">&quot;Thames played round them on his pastoral pipes. Bee-note
        and woodside blackbird, and meadow cow, and the leap of the fish in the silver rolling
        rings composed the music.&quot;</font><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>(Lord Orm</em><i>ont.)</p>
        </i><p>or that rapid impression of Venice, by Renée, in her brief Adriatic flight
        romanceward with Nevil Beauchamp:</p>
        <p></font><font SIZE="2">&quot;Green shutters, wet steps, barcaroli, brown women, striped
        posts, a scarlet night-cap, a sick fig-tree, an old shawl, faded spots of colour, peeling
        walls.&quot;</p>
        <p></font><font size="3">or, and finally, for one must make an end to what might be
        indefinitely prolonged and for the same reason,-- still to keep to <i>Beauchamp's Career</i>--this
        of the fading of Venice from the gaze of Renée and Nevil:</font><font SIZE="2"></p>
        <p>&quot;. . . [Leaning thus], with Nevil she said adieu to Venice, where the faint red
        Doge's palace was like the fading of another sunset north-westward of the glory along the
        hills. Venice dropped lower and lower, breasting the waters, until it was a thin line in
        air. The line was broken, and ran in dots, with here and there a pillar standing on opal
        sky. At last the topmost campanile sank. Renée looked up at the sails, and back for the
        submerged city. 'It is gone,' she said, as though a marvel had been worked; and swiftly.'
        &quot;</font><font size="3"></p>
        <p>As for more detailed description of those regions--Venetian, Lombardian, Alpine, Swiss,
        French, German, Austrian--which must be included by the literary geographer of the country
        of George Meredith, that too might be made the pleasant task of a volume rather than the
        difficult <i>coup d'oeil </i>and impossible adequate 'representation' of a magazine
        article. From <i>Richard Feverel </i>and <i>Beauchamp's Career, </i>the two deepest and
        tenderest and most winsome of the author's books, to the superb <i>Vittoria, </i>the
        brilliant and fascinating <i>Diana of the Crossways</i>;<i> </i>from that intense study of
        the Teuton nature aflame, <i>The Tragic Comedians</i>,<i> </i>to <i>Lord Ormont and his
        Aminta</i>,<i> </i>and the best loved and most lovable of Meredith's later romances, <i>The
        Amazing Marriage</i>,<i> </i>there is not one which would not yield some long excerpt of
        treasurable beauty and distinction. Which would it be, if but a quotation or two at most
        could be given? Shall it be just across the Channel, at Renée's Tourdestelle in Normandy,
        hidden behind that coast of interminable dunes, that coast seen by Nevil Beauchamp on his
        fateful visit &quot;dashed in rain-lines across a weed-strewn sea?&quot;&nbsp; Or at Baden
        Baden and the high Alps with Carinthia? Or with Richard Feverel in the woods at Nassau on
        the day when that &quot;tragic failure&quot; learns suddenly what has happened to poor
        Lucy . . . that he is a father? Or with beautiful and radiant Diana at Monte Generoso? Or
        with superb Vittoria at Monte Motterone, overlooking Lombardy and Italy?&nbsp; Or the
        Adriatic by night--or the Alps beyond Venice at dawn--or&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . but an end!</p>
        <p>&quot;The woman guides us.&quot;&nbsp; But which of the many beautiful women of
        Meredith's &quot;House of Life&quot; shall it be?&nbsp; All are unforgettable portraits,
        from Lucy Desborough and Renée de Croisnel to Clara Middleton, to Diana, to Carinthia;
        all are of vital womanly nature at its vividest, from Vittoria to Clotilde, from Cecilia
        Halkett to &quot;Browny&quot; Aminta (perhaps, of all, the nearest to the most modern
        ideal of woman, she who of all this author's women-characters appeals most to men and
        women jointly. . . . and has not he who knows her best written of her, &quot;All women
        were eclipsed by her. She was that fire in the night which lights the night and draws the
        night to look at it&quot;?)</p>
        <p>But let us choose another and less bewildering method. Nature is nature, whether viewed
        among the Alps, in Nassau forests, in Surrey woods or wealds. George Meredith writes with
        his bewitching mastery, not because he has travelled widely and seen much, but because
        from his cottagehome in the heart of Surrey, or wherever else he has lived, briefly or for
        long, he has observed with insatiable love and eagerness --because he has the transmuting
        mind and the instinct of interpretation. &quot;How did he learn to read at any moment
        right to the soul of a woman? It must be because of his being in heart and mind the
        brother to the sister with women.&quot; So, if not thus articulately, thought
        &quot;Browny&quot; of &quot; Matey &quot; Weyburn in that keen-eyed and perturbing
        chapter, &quot;Lovers Mated.&quot; And, it might be added of their creator, how did he
        learn to read at any moment right to the soul of any aspect of nature? . . . It must be
        because of his being heart and mind the brother to the living soul that breathes and
        reveals itself in &quot;the everything and the all&quot; of Nature. Hidden in the midst of
        the two hundred and ninetieth page of <i>The Ordeal of Richard Feverel </i>is the
        clue-word of that book--of all his work. The &quot;auroral&quot; air is that wherein his
        genius takes wing, whence it comes, whither it soars, though its pastures are of earth,
        and oftenest indeed of the earth earthy. This is the secret of his magnificent sanity this
        undying youth with the wisdom of the sage and the auroral joy of life.</p>
        <p>What a wealth to draw from! One need not turn to the more familiar scenes, and can find
        the unsurpassable by the sand country, marsh, and meadow of Bevisham, or by sea-set
        Felixstowe, as well as among the high Alps or where Venice lies &quot;like a sleeping
        queen&quot; on the Adriatic. What pictures innumerable, besides these the better known of
        Lucy and Renée, Sandra and Clotilde, Diana and Clara, Aminta and Carinthia, and their
        eager lovers . . . .as, for example, that of the lovely episode of Cecilia Halkett's
        voiceless wooing in the dawn &quot;of a splendid day of the young Spring.&quot;</p>
        <p>So saturated with the sense of nature is all Meredith's work in prose or verse, so
        continually illumined is it with vivid allusion or revealing glance that--ot withstanding
        the innumerable pages given to nature--background in foreign lands, from Norman
        Tourdestelle to Adriatic Chioggia, from Madeira in the Canary Sea to Meran in the Austrian
        Tyrol--the prevailing impression on the habitual reader of his writings is that his
        &quot;country&quot; is our own familiar English country, and preeminently Surrey and Hants
        and Dorset, or all from Felixstowe (of the immortal swim) to Bevisham, south-west of the
        Isle of Wight and the dancing Solent.</p>
        <p>It is in his verse, however, that Meredith has given most intimate and poignant as well
        as most personal expression to his deep love of and exceptional intimacy with nature. If
        we must make exception, let it be such a passage as that where Richard Feverel first sees
        Lucy Desborough, when on the dream-quest after his ideal &quot;Clare Doria Forey&quot; . .
        . &quot;(name of) perfect melody! . . . sliding with the tide, he heard it fluting in the
        bosom of the hills;&quot; or that ever-lifting passage beginning, &quot;Above
        green-flashing plunges of a weir, and shaken by the thunder below, lilies, golden and
        white, were swaying at anchor among the reeds. Meadow-sweet hung from the banks thick with
        weed and trailing bramble, and there also hung a daughter of earth;&quot; . . . or that
        (since Richard's romance holds one spell-bound) where Sir Austin Feverel and his son are
        together in a railway-carriage, as they approach Bellingham at sundown, and the young man
        looks out over the pine-hills beyond to the last rosy streak in a green sky, and sees in
        &quot;the sad beauty of that one spot in the heavens&quot; the very symbol of the ache and
        wonder in his heart. For in these things is the very breath of poetry, if not the metrical
        semblance.</p>
        <p>But to begin now and quote from the poetry of George Meredith would keep us
        indefinitely. It is led to, often, by rough roads, and not infrequently rude and even
        unsightly and unwelcome banks, obscure dew-wet pasture and moonlit glade. But his
        &quot;country&quot; is always the country of Beauty, of the poet. One ever looks back
        across &quot;the twilight wave,&quot; and sees there, as in a dream, remembered images of
        what has impassioned and inspired:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <i><p><font SIZE="2">We saw the swallows gathering in the sky,<br>
          And in the oiser-isle we heard their noise.<br>
          We had not to look back on summer joys,<br>
          Or forward to a summer of bright dye.<br>
          But in the largeness of the evening earth<br>
          Our spirits grew as we went side by side.<br>
          The hour became her husband, and my bride.<br>
          Love that had robbed us so, thus bless'd our dearth<br>
          The pilgrims of the year wax'd very loud<br>
          In multitudinous chatterings, as the flood<br>
          Full brown came from the west, and like pale blood<br>
          Expanded to the upper crimson cloud.<br>
          Love that had robbed us of immortal things,<br>
          This little moment mercifully gave,<br>
          And still I see across the twilight wave<br>
          The swan sail with her young beneath her wings.</p>
          </font></i>
        </blockquote>
        </font><font SIZE="2"><p></font><font size="3">Those who would be in closest touch with
        the veritable &quot;country of George Meredith&quot; will find it in his poetry. It is the
        country of that Surrey where he has so long lived, so long watched the wild cherry in the
        hollow behind Box Hill blossom anew at the clarions of Spring, or the nightjar &quot;spin
        his dark monotony&quot; from the moonlit pine-branch each recurrent June; where he has so
        often rejoiced in the south-west wind leaping bacchanalian across the hills and vales, or
        seen winter silence fall upon that winding Mole by whose still stream he has so often
        dreamed, or watched the reds and yellows of autumn glorify the woodland fastness behind
        the inn at Burford Bridge--that inn of many memories, where Keats wrote part of his <i>Endymion</i>,
        which for Robert Louis Stevenson had so great a fascination (and has by him been snatched
        out of the dusk of passing things), where first the two greatest romancists of to-day met,
        &quot;in the fellowship of Omar.&quot; In one or other of the small editions of the <i>Selected
        Poems</i> the reader will find the &quot;life&quot; of the author, as he lives it, and has
        for so long lived it, in his quiet home. This lies but a stone's-throw from what was till
        recently a lonely country road, though now a thoroughfare almost metropolitan in its
        continual business of coach and motor. It has still, however, at times, much of its old
        fascination for the diminishing few who go afoot, and the still rarer folk of the yellow
        van. <i>The Lark Ascending, Woodland Peace, Seed-time, The South-Wester, The Thrush in
        February, Breath of the Briar, Love in a Valley, Hymn to Colour, Night of Frost in May,
        Woods of Westermain--</i>the<i> </i>very names are &quot;breaths of the briar.&quot;
        &nbsp; Who has not thrilled over <i>Love in a Valley, </i>and to its lilting music ? . . .
        perhaps also to those four lines which Rossetti once quoted to the present writer as the
        most beautiful of their kind in the language, adding &quot;if whiteness be the colour of
        poetry, then here is virgin whiteness&quot;:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <i><p><font SIZE="2">When from bed she rises, clothed from neck to ankle<br>
          In her long nightgown sweet as boughs of May,<br>
          Beauteous she looks! like a tall garden lily<br>
          Pure from the night and Perfect from the day!</p>
          </font></i>
        </blockquote>
        </font><font SIZE="2"><p></font><font size="3">There are such material differences in the
        two extant versions (<i>Love in a Valley</i>)<i> </i>as to constitute them two poems
        rather than variants of one. In that of 1851 there are eleven stanzas; in that, thirty-two
        years later, of <i>Poems and Lyrics of the Joy of Earth </i>(or, rather, that of <i>Macmillan's
        Magazine </i>in 1878, twenty-seven years later), there are more than half as many
        again--in all, twenty-six. Of the eleven stanzas of the earlier version only the first,
        second, fourth, eighth, and ninth reappear, though through the fourteenth of the later
        version rises the phantom of the original fifth stanza. In rhythmic beauty this fourteenth
        stanza is finer, but in the earlier the poetic note is as authentic and one misses the
        lovely line (following the &quot;whitenecked swallows twittering of summer,&quot; and the
        jasmine and woodbine &quot;breathing sweet&quot;),</p>
        <blockquote>
          <i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="2">Fill her with balm and nested Peace from head to
          feet.</p>
          </font></i>
        </blockquote>
        </font><font SIZE="2"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font size="3">Another lost beautiful line
        is that missing in the altered second stanza,</p>
        <blockquote>
          <i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font SIZE="2">Full of all the wilderness of&nbsp; the
          woodland creatures</p>
          </font></i><font size="3">
        </blockquote>
        </font><font SIZE="2"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font size="3">To the cancelled stanzas
        one can but say &quot;Ave atque vale,&quot; since the author's mature judgment wills them
        away; and yet it is with reluctance we lose the lines just quoted, or these:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="2">. . . <i>On a dewy eve-tide<br>
          Whispering together beneath the listening moon<br>
          I prayed till her cheek flush'd. . . .<br>
          . . . .Show the bridal Heavens but one star?<br>
          Is she a nightingale that will not be nested<br>
          Till the April woodland has built her bridal bower?<br>
          April . . . with thy crescent brows. . . .<br>
          Come, merry month of cuckoo and the violet!<br>
          Come, weeping Loveliness in all thy blue delight!</p>
          </i></font>
        </blockquote>
        </font><font SIZE="2"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font size="3">Surely that exquisite last
        line might have been saved! On the other hand, there is no music in the earlier to equal
        that of certain stanzas of the later version. . . .</p>
        <blockquote>
          <i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="2">Lovely are the curves of the white owl sweeping<br>
          Wavy in the dusk lit by one large star.<br>
          Lone on the fir-branch, his rattle-note unvaried,<br>
          Brooding o'er the gloom, spins the brown eve-jar. <br>
          Darker grows the valley . . . .</p>
          </font></i>

        </font><font SIZE="2"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font size="3">or the lovely &quot;swaying
        whitebeam&quot; music of the twenty-sixth stanza, or that even lovelier twenty-fourth

        with</p>

        </font><font SIZE="2"><p></font><font size="3">This oral citation of the poem by Rossetti
        must have been from two to three years before the publication of the revised and amplified
        <i>Love</i> <i>in a Valley </i>in book-form <i>(Poems and Lryics of the Joy of Earth, </i>1883).
        The poem as it is now known first appeared in <i>Macmillan's Magazine </i>(October 1878);
        but when Rossetti quoted the lines to me it was out of old remembrance . . . hence the
        epithet &quot;perfect&quot; for &quot;splendid&quot; in the last line. On the same
        occasion he showed me (after some search) a manuscript copy of it made--if I remember his
        words exactly--&quot;more than twenty years ago&quot;: and added that it was written in
        &quot;Meredith's 'George Meredith Feverel' days.&quot; I had not seen the poem in <i>Macmillan's,
        </i>and did not then know of the <i>Poems </i>of 1851; and, am not likely to forget the
        impression of its beauty as read by Rossetti from the MS., or the delight I had in making
        a copy of it. Years afterwards I had the deeper pleasure of hearing Meredith himself read
        the later and nobler version, in that little Swiss chalet of his above Flint Cottage and
        its gardens, where so much of his later work in prose and verse has been written--a little
        brown wooden house of the simplest, but to many friends richer in ardent memories than any
        palace in treasures . . . with its outlook down grassy terraces and pansied garden-rows
        across to the green thorn-stunted slope of Box Hill, and its glimpse leftward up that
        valley where still in nightingale-weather may be seen in a snow of bloom the wild white
        cherry which inspired the lines:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <i><p><font SIZE="2">Fairer than the lily, than the wild white cherry<br>
          Fair as an image my seraph love appears. . . .</p>

        </font><font SIZE="2"><p></font><font size="3">One wishes that, in his later poetry,
        Meredith had oftener sounded the simple and beautiful&nbsp; pastoral note which gave so
        lovely a beauty to his first volume of verse. We miss the music of the scenery and
        nature-life of his beloved Surrey; the lilt of songs such as the Autumn Song, beginning </p>

        </font><font SIZE="2"><p></font><font size="3">Among the ignorant and uncritical claims
        made for the poetry of the late W. E. Henley is that of his pioneer-use of unrhymed
        lyrical verse, or, it may be, with admission of Matthew Arnold's priority. But other
        writers preceded Mr. Henley, and, as I think, with a mastery beyond his (as again I think)
        overrated rhythmical experiments. At his best he never approaches the dignity of Arnold's
        unrhymed lyrical verse, or the suave and supple loveliness of Coventry Patmore's. Nor do I
        recollect any rhymeless lyrical verse of his finer in emotion and touch than the unrhymed
        stanza just quoted; or than this, from the unrhymed lyric of Nightfall (Pastoral No. V.):</p>

        taken wing, whose solace has been his deepest comfort in long seasons of sorrow, and is
        still his deepest happiness in the long days of old age--if one can think of this blithe
        spirit other than as eternally young.</p>
        <p>&quot;<i>O joy thus to revel all day in the grass of our own beloved country!</i>&quot;
        he sang, as a youth; and to-day the solitary old poet, looking out still on his
