        face="Comic Sans MS">Ian Fleming was the creator of James
        Bond - he wrote twelve James Bond novels between 1952 and
        1964. The movies have been produced since 1962. Bond's
        world was based on Fleming's own experiences in World War
        II.</font><p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fleming was
        plucked out of newspaper work to join British Naval
        Intelligence in 1939, when Churchill was still the First
        Lord of the Admiralty in Chamberlain's government. He
        became an aide to the Director of Naval Intelligence,
        Admiral John Godfrey, and was known as &quot;17F&quot;.
        He was trained at Intrepid's &quot;Camp X&quot;, on Lake
        Ontario in Canada, where he became practised at
        underwater demolition. He rose to the rank of Commander.
        With Godfrey, he met J. Edgar Hoover, head of the FBI, in
        1941, and had some influence in the establishment of the
        OSS, the forerunner of the CIA. Read more about Intrepid
        on </font><a href="gremlins.htm"><font color="#FF0000"
        face="Comic Sans MS">The Gremlins</font></a><font
        face="Comic Sans MS"> page on this site.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fleming was typical of the
        intelligence agents of his time, and thus archetypical of
        Bond, his creation. He came from a family of class,
        independent wealth, and a history of service. He attended
        the right schools, but did not excel. As his access to
        the family wealth was somewhat restricted, and he felt
        unable to live in this shadow, he struck out to develop
        his own fortunes. He travelled and read widely, and
        enjoyed the good life, working in journalism and banking.
        Intrepid did not select daredevils as his agents. He
        found that &quot;Some of the best agents are those who in
        peacetime make good bankers, physicians, or creative
        artists&quot; - someone with great energy, but full
        self-control. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">One of the more unusual
        operations that Fleming directed was <em>Operation
        Mincemeat</em>, later known by the book title<em> The Man
        Who Never Was</em>. At the conclusion of the Allied
        takeover of North Africa, the next obvious point of
        attack was Sicily. It became imperative to find a way of
        convincing Germany that the strike would be elsewhere.
        Fleming devised a scheme to disguise a body as a naval
        officer, complete with totally convincing
        &quot;secret&quot; papers showing a different plan of
        attack. The body, appearing to be a casualty from a
        shot-down plane, would then be floated ashore in Spain,
        where local German spies would find it. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fleming's task was to make
        the body totally convincing. The book covers the minute
        attention paid to detail, which included placing theatre
        tickets and love letters in &quot;Major Martin's&quot;
        pockets. The operation was overwhelmingly successful. The
        love letters were in fact written by Paddy Bennett,
        Fleming's secretary (later known as Lady Victoire
        Ridsdale). Bennett was later the inspiration for Mrs.
        Moneypenny, although she has insisted that she was never
        in love with Fleming. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fleming drew many of his
        ideas for the Bond stories from Intrepid's operations and
        his own experience. When Intrepid read the first Bond
        book, <em>Casino Royale</em>, he told Fleming that it
        wouldn't sell - &quot;Truth is always less
        believable...&quot; Goldfinger's raid on Fort Knox was
        inspired by Intrepid's plan to steal Vichy French gold
        from Martinique. This plan was never put into action, but
        the threat was sufficient to effectively blackmail the
        still-neutral US Government into extending additional
        loans to Britain. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Exotic locales featured in
        both the fiction and the fact. When an additional base
        was needed in 1941, Bermuda was chosen for a number of
        strategic reasons; Intrepid also later retired there. In
        1974, it was claimed that there had been a real
        &quot;James Bond&quot;, based in Intrepid's hotel room in
        the Hamilton Princess in Bermuda. (Fleming actually
        copied the name of Bond from a real ornithologist and
        author of a book called <em>Birds of the West Indies</em>.)
        The Gazebo Bar at the Hamilton Princess featured an
        aquarium, reminiscent of Dr. No's shark tanks. Fleming
        wrote the Bond books in the house he designed himself, <em>Goldeneye</em>,
        in Jamaica, where he later retired. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Other celebrities that are
        said to have worked for Intrepid in various capacities
        included Greta Garbo and Noël Coward. Coward was fluent
        in Spanish, and collected intelligence while touring
        Latin America, where Germany was preparing its US
        propaganda campaigns. </font><a href="gremlins.htm"><font
        color="#FF0000" face="Comic Sans MS">Roald Dahl</font></a><font
        face="Comic Sans MS"> also enters the story again much
        later - he wrote the screenplay for <em>You Only Live
        Twice</em>, filmed in 1967, three years after Fleming's
        death.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Mrs. Moneypenny&quot;
        gained some notoriety as recently as 1997, when at the
        age of 75 she beat off two would-be thieves in London.
        One of the men attempted to grab her wedding ring as she
        got out of her car. &quot;That was just too much for me
        ... I kicked him in the groin and he doubled up in
        pain.&quot; The two men fled. </font></p>

        <h3><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fleming's car</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">James Urquhart, of
        Armidale, New South Wales, wrote in 1999 that his
        grandfather has one of Ian Fleming's Cars:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">It is a 1955
            MK11 Armstrong Siddeley; he purchased it from a
            doctor in Sydney. Everything on the car is still
            original; you won't find a speck of dust anywhere. It
            has also won numerous prizes at car shows... He
            purchased the car on 9 June 1978 from a person by the
            name of Prof Tom Thompson. He was a Professor in
            aeronautics at The University of Sydney. Ian Fleming
            purchased the car in November 1954. It is believed
            that he used the car for playing golf. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">He sold it to
            a person by the name of John Lyonel Jamieson. He in
            turn sold it to Henry William Warner in 1959. Then a
            person by the name of Helmut Kolsen from Sydney
            bought the car. Prof Tom Thompson was the person who
            rebuilt the car back to its original condition. My
            grandfather has photos and the paperwork for the car,
            including the original papers signed by Fleming...</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Man Who Never Was</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Major Martin's identity was
        kept secret for many years, and there is now some
        controversy over who he really was - a number of Web
        sites cover the current theories. It was reported in 1997
        that he was Glyndwr Michael, a Welsh vagrant who died of
        pneumonia after attempting suicide by drinking rat
        poison. However, a TV documentary screened in the UK in
        early 2003 claimed that he was Tom Martin, a sailor
        killed when the aircraft carrier Dasher sank off the
        Scottish coast. This was based on research into clues
        apparently left by Ewen Montagu, the author of the book
        and senior officer in charge of the operation. Major
        Martin - whoever he really was - is buried in Huelva,
        Spain.</font></p>

        Story of Glyndwr Michael</font></a><font
        face="Comic Sans MS">.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">One of the reasons that <em>Mincemeat</em>
        was so successful was the continual battle between
        competing intelligence organisations in Germany. The
        intelligence carried by Martin was used as a pawn in this
        battle, to great effect. The interception of German
        Enigma traffic by British intelligence confirmed within
        days that the Abwehr accepted the information as genuine.
