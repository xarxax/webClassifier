        <h1>Jakob van Hoddis</h1>
        <p>Jakob van Hoddis (anagrammatic pseudonym of Hans Davidsohn) was born
        on 16.5.1887 in Berlin and<br>
        died after 30.4.1942 (exact date unknown) near Koblenz. Following
        studies in architecture in<br>
        Munich, van Hoddis studied classical philology and philosophy in Jena
        and later on in Berlin.<br>
        In Berlin he met Kurt Hiller. Together with him, Georg Heym and Erwin
        Loewenson he<br>
        founded the »New Club« and the »Neopathetic Cabaret« in 1909. First
        symptoms of<br>
        schizophrenia showed in 1912. A temporary recovery permitted him to
        travel to Paris and Munich. In<br>
        1914 he had to undergo treatment. In private care since 1915, he became
        a patient in the<br>
        Bendorf/Sayn asylum near Koblenz in 1933. From there he was deported in
        1942 as »No. 8«.<br>
        There were no survivors of this transport.</p>
        <p>Jakob van Hoddis and the »New Club« circle are considered to be
        part of early<br>
        expressionism. The most influential member of this group was van Hoddis.
        His work,<br>
        consisting of poetry and prose, was written between 1907 and 1914. His
        most famous poem is<br>
        <a href="#we">Weltende</a>, which describes the decline of the bourgeois world as the
        beginning of the ultimate<br>
        catastrophe which will lead to the end of the world, uniting elements of
        vision, grotesquerie,<br>
        irony, sarcasm and melancholy. The typical expressionist motives of the
        big city and<br>
        vaudeville are also present in his poetry. He attempted to increase the
        intensity of his<br>
        language by the use of colloquial expressions and foreign words.</p>
        <h2>Works</h2>
        <p>Weltende, 1911, published as poetry collection in 1918. – Weltende,
        collected poems, edited<br>

        <h2><a name="we">World's End</a></h2>
        <p>The hat flies off the burgher's pointed head.<br>
        There's an echo of screams and shouts in the air.<br>
        Roofers are crashing and breaking in two.<br>
        Along the coast, the papers say, the flood is rising.</p>
        <p>The storm is here, wild oceans are hopping<br>
        ashore to crush big fat embankments.<br>
        Most people have a runny nose and sniffle,<br>
        and trains are falling off the bridges.</p>
