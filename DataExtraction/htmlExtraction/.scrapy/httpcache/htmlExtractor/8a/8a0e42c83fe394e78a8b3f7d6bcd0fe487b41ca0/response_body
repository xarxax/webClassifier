<P>Anne Bront&euml; was the youngest of the genius triad of Victorian sister-authors;
being slightly less well known than her two sisters Charlotte and Emily,
of <I>Jane Eyre</I> and <I>Wuthering Heights</I> fame respectively; however,
it comes as some surprise to many people to learn that during her lifetime
Anne was the most successful of the three, being the only one to get her
first two novels successfully published - Charlotte's first novel being
rejected by every publisher to whom it was sent; Anne's second novel, <I>The
Tenant of Wildfell Hall</I>, rapidly outsold Emily's all-time classic and
only novel, <I>Wuthering Heights</I>; following the failure of the three
sisters' combined book of poems, Anne was the only one who went on to have
success in getting a number of her poems published independent of her sisters;
and she is the only one who has had a number of hymns published: many still
appearing in the hymn books of various religious denominations today. It
was only her early death, coupled with a number of subsequent actions by
Charlotte, that has left Anne in the shade of her two elder siblings.</P>

<P>Both Anne and Emily died within little over a year of achieving fame;
only Charlotte lived on for a number of years and was able to fully enjoy
that status. During this time, she made friends with the writer Mrs. Elizabeth
Gaskell who, a few years after Charlotte's death, wrote her biography.
However, it was many years before anyone set about writing a biography
of Anne or Emily, and by this time information about them had become relatively
scarce and 'patchy'. Some information could certainly be gained from Mrs.
Gaskell's <I>Life of Charlotte Bront&euml;</I>, but acquisition of other
details relied on the memory of the Bront&euml;s' friends, servants and
acquaintances who lived into old age. The unfortunate consequence is that
a fair percentage of the content of their biographies is based on supposition,
probabilities and likelihoods rather than known facts. </P>

<P>Many people are aware that Anne's grave is situated in Scarborough -
at the northern end of St. Mary's churchyard, beneath the castle walls;
but few know anything of how she came to be interred there, or what her
connections with the resort were. The following paragraphs give a brief
account of Anne's life, and highlight her connections with Scarborough
. . .</P>

<P>Anne was born in the small Yorkshire village of Thornton on 17 January
1820, the sixth and last child of the Reverend Patrick Bront&euml;, a man
of Irish decent, and his Cornish wife Maria. A few months after Anne's
birth, Patrick was made perpetual curate of Haworth - a small town some
seven miles away, and in April, the family moved into the Haworth Parsonage.
This building became the Bront&euml; family home for the rest of their
lives. The following year, Mrs. Bront&euml; was taken seriously ill with
cancer: she died in September aged just thirty-eight. Maria's sister, Elizabeth
Branwell, had moved into the Parsonage, initially to nurse her dying sister,
but she subsequently spent the rest of her life there raising the Bront&euml;
children. She was known to the young Bront&euml;s as 'Aunt Branwell'. In
1825, the two eldest Bront&euml; girls died of consumption - a disease
more commonly known today as tuberculosis - at the ages of eleven and ten,
leaving the three sisters who went on to write some of the greatest novels
ever written, and their brother, Branwell.</P>

<P>At a very early age, the four remaining children developed a keen interest
in reading, and studied a wide range of material - visiting local libraries
to gain access to a much wider range of books than those available to them
at the Parsonage. They soon began to make up their own stories, and eventually
invented their own fantasy kingdoms, complete with imaginary rulers, people
and adventures. These fantasy worlds and kingdoms gradually acquired all
the characteristics of the real world - sovereigns, armies, heroes, outlaws,
fugitives, inns, schools, publishers; and for these peoples and lands the
children created newspapers, magazines and chronicles, all of which were
written out in extremely tiny books, with writing that was so small it
was difficult to read without the aid of a magnifying glass. These juvenile
creations and writings served as the apprenticeship of their later, incredible
literary talents.</P>

<P>The young Bront&euml;s made little attempt to mix with others outside
the Parsonage, but relied upon each other for friendship and companionship,
and the bleak moors surrounding Haworth became their playground.</P>

<P>Anne was initially educated by her father and aunt, and to some degree
by Charlotte, who had spent some time in boarding school at Roe Head -
some eighteen miles away. In 1835, Charlotte returned to the school to
commence her first employment: she became a teacher there and was accompanied
by Emily who went as a pupil. Within a few months, Emily became extremely
ill due to acute homesickness. She was withdrawn from the school and replaced
by Anne, who spent the next two years at this establishment, earning a
'good conduct' prize along the way.</P>

<P>In 1839, a year after leaving the school, and at the age of nineteen,
Anne set out to begin her first period of employment: she was to become
a governess with the Ingham family at Blake Hall, Mirfield, which was situated
just two miles from Roe Head. The Inghams were well known to the school-mistress
and owner of Roe Head School, Miss Margaret Wooler; and also had connections
with the Nussey family, whose daughter, Ellen, had become a close friend
of the Bront&euml;s after developing a friendship with Charlotte at the
school several years earlier; and it was probably through one of these
avenues that Anne obtained the post. </P>

<P>The children in Anne's charge were spoilt and wild, and persistently
disobeyed, defied, teased and tormented her. She experienced great difficulty
controlling them, and had almost no success in instilling any education.
She was not empowered to inflict any punishment, and when she complained
of their behaviour to their parents she received no support whatever, but
was merely criticised for not being capable of her job. By the end of the
year the Inghams decided they needed to find some other mode of education
for their offspring: Anne returned home, her employment with the family
having come to an abrupt end. The whole episode at Blake Hall was so traumatic
for Anne, that she reproduced it in almost perfect detail in her later
novel, <I>Agnes Grey</I>. </P>

<P><A NAME="1"></A>With her characteristic determination, she soon obtained
her second post: this time as a governess to the children of the Reverend
Edmund Robinson at Thorp Green - near York. This was about forty miles
from Haworth, and the furthest any of the Bront&euml;s had worked away
from home. Initially, she encountered the same problems with the unruly
children, that she had experienced at Blake Hall. Her own quiet, gentle
disposition did not help matters. However, as one biographer has stated,
despite her outwardly placid appearance, Anne had a 'core of steel': with
sheer determination, and the experience she gradually gained, she made
a resounding success of her position, becoming 'wondrously valued' by her
new employers. Her charges, the Robinson girls, ultimately became her life
long friends, and years later turned to their former governess, rather
than their mother, in times of trouble. In 1848, several years after Anne
had ended her employment with the Robinsons, Bessy and Mary Robinson, her
former pupils, visited her at the Haworth Parsonage, and Charlotte reported
the occasion to Ellen Nussey, declaring that their guests were <FONT COLOR="#000060">'attractive
and stylish looking girls . . . they seemed overjoyed to see Anne; when
I went in the room they were clinging round her like two children - she,
meantime, looking perfectly quiet and passive.'</FONT><SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>
<A HREF="sourcebi.html#1">1</A> </FONT></SUP>&nbsp;Many years after the
entire Bront&euml; family had died, it was recorded that Mary <FONT COLOR="#000060">'always
retained the most kindly memories of her gentle governess'</FONT>.<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="sourcebi.html#2">2</A>
</FONT></SUP>&nbsp;All three Bront&euml; sisters had spent time working
as governesses or teachers, and all had experienced problems controlling
their charges, gaining support from their employers, and coping with home-sickness
- but Anne was the only one who persevered and made a success of the work.</P>

<P><A NAME="3"></A>Anne experienced much home-sickness and depression during
the five years she spent with the Robinsons, but there was one aspect of
her position that was a sheer delight. She was obliged to accompany the
family on their annual holidays to Scarborough. Between 1840 and 1844,
she spent around five weeks each summer at the resort, and fell totally
in love with the place. The Robinsons stayed in the prestigious Wood's
Lodgings, an establishment patronised by only the very rich, and situated
at the best location in the resort - on the top of St. Nicholas Cliff at
the centre of the bay (today, this site is occupied by the giant Grand
Hotel). Its rear windows gave spectacular views over the bay and across
to the castle, which crowned the headland - jutting out to sea at the northern
end of the bay. It is evident from her novels that Anne explored almost
every corner of Scarborough. She visited the castle grounds,<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="sourcebi.html#3">3n</A>
</FONT></SUP>&nbsp;took walks across the South Cliff,<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="sourcebi.html#4">4n</A>
</FONT></SUP>&nbsp;and particularly enjoyed strolling across the towering
'Spa Bridge' which stood just beside Wood's Lodgings, running parallel
to the beach, and spanning the gorge down which ran, at that time, the
'Mill beck' - a small stream running from the southern inland area of Scarborough
down to the sea. Like Wood's Lodgings, it provided spectacular views of
the South Bay and castle; but with the added benefit of the fresh sea breeze
that would frequently blow across it. She engaged in bathing in the nearby
indoor baths,<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="sourcebi.html#5">5n</A> </FONT></SUP>&nbsp;and
almost certainly tried sea-bathing.<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="sourcebi.html#6">6n</A>
</FONT></SUP>&nbsp;She would certainly have visited the 'Rotunda', a small
circular museum located just below the Spa Bridge: possibly taking her
charges there as an educational exercise. This museum was described by
her brother, Branwell, in an unfinished novel: both it and the Spa Bridge
remain today. One of Anne's greatest pleasures was a ramble across the
South Sands to the <FONT COLOR="#000060">'low rocks out at sea'</FONT>
(as she describes them in her novel, <I>Agnes Grey</I>) located close to
the southern end of the bay. These are formed by a giant platform of rock
jutting through the sands, partly covered with moss and seaweed, and interspersed
with a myriad of indentations and crevices, many holding pools of crystal
clear water - regularly topped-up by the flowing and ebbing tide, while
others hold pockets of sand and appear like miniature beaches. Indeed,
Anne describes a walk to and across these rocks with uncanny precision
in the penultimate chapter of <I>Agnes Grey</I>. A number of other locations
in the resort formed the setting for some of the final scenes in this novel.
</P>

<P><A NAME="7"></A>Over the period Anne was working for the Robinsons,
the three sisters several times considered the possibility of setting-up
their own school. Various locations, including their own home, the Parsonage,
were considered as places to establish it: on one occasion Charlotte suggested
siting it at the seaside resort of Bridlington, where she and Ellen Nussey
had taken a few weeks holiday several years earlier: Anne dreamed of locating
the school at Scarborough.<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="sourcebi.html#7">7n</A></FONT></SUP>
</P>

<P>In 1843, Anne secured a position for Branwell at Thorp Green: he was
to take over from her as tutor to the Robinson's son, Edmund (jnr.), who
was now growing too old to be under Anne's care. Like Anne, Branwell also
made a success of his post, but he was soon enticed into a secret relationship
with his employers wife, Lydia Robinson. The affair continued for two and
a half years before their proceedings were discovered by her husband (Anne
and Branwell's employer), Edmund Robinson. It seems Mrs. Robinson laid
all the blame on Branwell for initiating, and taking the leading role in
all stages of the affair, though all the evidence suggests otherwise. In
the event, Mr. Robinson stood by his wife, and Branwell was sternly dismissed,
being warned <FONT COLOR="#000060">'on pain of exposure to break off instantly
and for ever all communication with every member of his family'</FONT>.
He was devastated: Branwell had become besotted with Lydia Robinson, foolishly
believing she would one day marry him. He sank into a deep depression,
turned heavily to drink and became increasingly dependent on opium, a situation
from which he never recovered. The Robinson incident is believed to have
been the primary cause of his subsequent decline in health which, a few
years later, led to his death.</P>

<P><A NAME="8"></A>In 1846, the three sisters made their first venture
into the literary world by having, at their own expense, a book of their
combined poems published. The book appeared under their three chosen pseudonyms
- or 'pen-names', the initials of which were the same as their own. Charlotte
became 'Currer Bell', Emily became 'Ellis Bell' and Anne became 'Acton
Bell'. The sisters had chosen male pen-names as it was generally believed
that female writers were unfairly treated by the critics. The book was
a dismal failure, with only two copies being sold during the first year.
However, even before the fate of the book of poems became apparent, the
three sisters were working on a new project. Charlotte was soon writing
to their publisher, <FONT COLOR="#000060">'Gentlemen, C., E. and A. Bell
are now preparing for the press a work of fiction, consisting of three
distinct and unconnected tales, which may be published either together,
as a work of three volumes of the ordinary novel size, or separately as
single volumes, as shall be deemed most advisable . . .'</FONT>.<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="sourcebi.html#8">8</A>
</FONT></SUP>&nbsp;The three novels were Charlotte's '<I>The Professor</I>',
Emily's '<I>Wuthering Heights</I>' and Anne's '<I>Agnes Grey</I>'. The
publishers wrote back advising that they did not deal in works of fiction,
but sent the sisters a list of publishers that did: and so, the manuscripts
of the three novels were soon sent 'the rounds' of the various publishers.
After a number of rejections, Emily's <I>Wuthering Heights</I> and Anne's
<I>Agnes Grey</I> were accepted by one Thomas Cautley Newby; a publisher
in London, but Charlotte's novel was rejected by Newby, and by every other
publisher to whom it was sent. However, Charlotte was not long in completing
her second novel, the now famous <I>Jane Eyre</I>, and this was immediately
accepted by Smith, Elder &amp; Co., a different publisher to Anne's and
Emily's though also located in London. As it transpired, <I>Jane Eyre</I>
was the first to appear in print. While Anne and Emily's novels 'lingered
in the press', <A NAME="9"></A>Charlotte's second novel hit the literary
world like a bombshell: it became an immediate and resounding success.
This story had been constructed using writing techniques that were unorthodox
and very different to those she had used in her previous novel, and indeed,
any of her juvenile writings; and these have won Charlotte much acclaim
over the years; however, attentive examination reveals that they closely
follow techniques that were innovated by Anne nine months earlier in the
writing of <I>Agnes Grey</I>.<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="sourcebi.html#9">9</A>
</FONT></SUP>&nbsp;Anne and Emily's publisher was urged on by the success
of <I>Jane Eyre</I>, and their novels soon followed. These too sold exceptionally
well, and although <I>Agnes Grey</I> has since been described by one author
as <FONT COLOR="#000060">'the most perfect prose narrative in English Literature'</FONT>,<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="sourcebi.html#10">10n</A>
</FONT></SUP>&nbsp;it was distinctly outshone by Emily's much more dramatic
<I>Wuthering Heights</I>. Within a year, however, Anne fired back with
her second novel, <I>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</I>, which was an instant
phenomenal success and rapidly outsold Emily's all-time classic. Within
six weeks <I>Wildfell Hall</I> was sold out, and by July 1848, Anne was
writing her now famous preface to the second edition. </P>

<P>Things were looking very rosy for the sisters; a highly successful literary
career appeared a certainty for them all. There was no hint of the impending
tragedy that was to befall the family: within the next ten months, three
of the siblings, including Anne, would be dead.</P>

<P>The first blow fell on the 24 September 1848: Branwell's health had
gradually deteriorated over the previous two years, but its seriousness
was half disguised by his persistent drunkenness. His death, which occurred
on that morning, came as a shock to the family. He was aged just thirty
one. The cause was recorded as 'Chronic bronchitis - Marasmus'; though,
through his recorded symptoms, it is now believed that he was also suffering
from consumption (tuberculosis).</P>

<P>By the end of October, Charlotte was writing to her friend, Ellen Nussey:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="11"></A><FONT COLOR="#000060">'I feel much more uneasy about
my sisters than myself just now. Emily's cold and cough are very obstinate;
I fear she has pain in the chest, and I sometimes catch a shortness in
her breathing when she has moved at all quickly. She looks very, very thin
and pale. Her reserved nature occasions one great uneasiness of mind -
it is useless to question her - you get no answers - it is still more useless
to recommend remedies - they are never adopted. Nor can I shut my eyes
to the fact of Anne's great delicacy of constitution.'<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>
<A HREF="sourcebi.html#11">11</A></FONT></SUP> </FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="12"></A>By this time, Emily was firmly in the grip of consumption,
which, being contagious, could well have been caught from Branwell. She
deteriorated rapidly over a two month period, persistently refusing all
medical aid until the morning of 19 December, when, being so weak, she
declared: <FONT COLOR="#000060">&quot;if you will send for a doctor, I
will see him now.&quot;</FONT><SUP><FONT SIZE=-2> <A HREF="sourcebi.html#12">12</A>
</FONT></SUP>&nbsp;The local doctor was immediately sent for, but it was
far too late: there was nothing he could do. At about two o'clock that
afternoon, after <FONT COLOR="#000060">'a hard, short conflict'</FONT>
in which she struggled desperately to hang on to life, she died on the
dining room sofa: she was aged just thirty.</P>

<P>Anne had already been suffering from what was believed to be a cold
for the previous few weeks. Over Christmas, her symptoms intensified, and
in early January, her father, Patrick sent for a Leeds physician 'who was
an expert in consumptive cases'. On January 5th Dr. Teale examined Anne
at the Parsonage. He diagnosed her condition as consumption, and intimated
that it was quite advanced leaving little hope of a recovery. Unlike Emily,
Anne took all the recommended medicines, and responded to all the advice
she was given. Her health fluctuated as the months passed, but she progressively
grew thinner and weaker. On 1 May, Charlotte wrote to Ellen Nussey, to
report on Anne's condition:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="13"></A><FONT COLOR="#000060">'. . . She is very much emaciated,
far more so than when you were with us; her arms are no thicker than a
little child's. The least exertion brings a shortness of breath. She goes
out a little every day, but we creep rather than walk. . .'<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>
<A HREF="sourcebi.html#13">13</A></FONT></SUP> </FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="14"></A>By this time Anne had decided to make a return visit
to Scarborough in the hope that the change of location and fresh sea air
might initiate a recovery, and give her a chance to live: indeed, the doctors
of the time had said that a <FONT COLOR="#000060">'change of air or removal
to a better climate would hardly ever fail of success in consumptive cases
if the remedy were taken in time'</FONT>, and Dr. Teale had particularly
approved of Anne's choice of Scarborough. Charlotte initially gave much
opposition to the plan, fearing the journey would be too stressful for
her ailing sister. However, Anne eventually convinced Charlotte that it
was her last hope, and on Thursday, 24 May 1849, the two set off, accompanied
by their friend Ellen Nussey, for Scarborough. En-route, the three spent
a day and a night in York, where, escorting Anne around in a wheel chair,
they did some shopping, and at Anne's request, visited the colossal York
Minster. Anne had developed a strong affinity for the Minster from her
visits there with the Robinsons when she worked at Thorp Green. Ellen later
recorded that as Anne gazed up at the magnificent structure, she said:
<FONT COLOR="#000060">&quot;If finite power can do this, what is the .
. . ?&quot;</FONT> when emotion stayed her speech, and her companions quickly
moved her to a less exciting scene.<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="sourcebi.html#14">14</A></FONT></SUP>
</P>

<P><A NAME="15"></A>The small party arrived at Scarborough on the Friday
afternoon. Anne was now very weak and frail, but she appeared somewhat
revived on being back in the place she so much loved. She gained great
pleasure in pointing out the delights of the resort to Charlotte and Ellen.
The party had booked rooms in Wood's Lodgings - the establishment where
Anne had stayed with the Robinsons some five to nine years earlier. The
morning after her arrival, she attended the nearby Indoor Sea-water Baths,<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="sourcebi.html#15">15n</A>
</FONT></SUP>&nbsp;and at her own insistence, was left to bathe there alone.
However, on her return, she collapsed with exhaustion outside her lodgings.
Not to alarm Charlotte and Ellen, Anne did not inform them of this incident
until some considerable time later. In the afternoon, she drove herself
in a donkey cart on the South Sands, and when Ellen arrived to meet her,
she found Anne giving the donkey-boy a lecture on treating the animal well.
<FONT COLOR="#000060">'She was ever fond of dumb things, and would give
up her own comfort for them'</FONT> reported Ellen later.<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>
<A HREF="sourcebi.html#16">16</A></FONT></SUP> </P>

<P>On the Sunday afternoon, Anne enthusiastically chaperoned Charlotte
and Ellen along the Spa Bridge, and the three enjoyed the spectacular open
view of the bay from there. Later, overcome with exhaustion, she sat on
a seat near the beach and urged her companions to walk on further. It was
later this evening that she realised there was no hope left, and that she
did not have long to live. She begun discussing, with Charlotte, the propriety
of returning to Haworth. Not that she wanted to return for her own sake,
she said, but she did not want to leave her companions with the problems,
and distress of having to return her lifeless remains home. She spent the
rest of the evening sat by her lodgings room window - looking out over
the bay, and watching <FONT COLOR="#000060">'the most glorious sunset ever
witnessed'</FONT>. The night passed without incident, but the following
morning she was so weak that Ellen had to carry her, like a baby, down
the stairs for breakfast, which, for Anne, was a bowl of boiled milk that
had been especially prepared for her.</P>

<P>The three spent the rest of the morning in their lounge; Anne sat in
her easy chair by the window, looking out over the bay once more; the weather
was glorious and the sea as <FONT COLOR="#000060">'calm as glass'</FONT>:
she looked <FONT COLOR="#000060">'so serene and reliant'</FONT>, reported
Ellen. <FONT COLOR="#000060">'Nothing occurred to incite alarm until about
11 a.m. when Anne announced that she felt a change: she believed she did
not have long to live.'</FONT> A doctor was called, and Anne asked him
<FONT COLOR="#000060">'how long he thought she might live - not to fear
speaking the truth, for she was not afraid to die'</FONT>. The doctor admitted
<FONT COLOR="#000060">'that the angel of death had already arrived and
that life was ebbing fast. She thanked him for his truthfulness . . . and
reverently invoked a blessing from on high, first on her sister, then upon
her friend, to whom she said, &quot;be a sister in my stead. Give Charlotte
as much of your company as you can.&quot; '</FONT></P>

<P>When she became restless as death approached, she was carried across
to the sofa, and asked if she were easier: she replied <FONT COLOR="#000060">&quot;It
is not you who can give me ease, but soon all will be well through the
merits of our Redeemer.&quot;</FONT> Seeing Charlotte was barely able to
restrain her grief, she whispered her last words: <FONT COLOR="#000060">&quot;Take
courage, Charlotte; take courage&quot;</FONT>. A few moments later, at
two o'clock in the afternoon of Whit Monday, 28 May 1849, Anne quietly
died.</P>

<P><A NAME="17"></A>At this time, and over the previous few months - throughout
the greatest trial of her life, Anne had shown astounding fortitude and
courage. Emily's famous line 'no coward soul is mine' befitted Anne far
more than it ever befitted Emily. The doctor who attended Anne during her
last hours <FONT COLOR="#000060">'wondered at her fixed tranquillity of
spirit and settled longing to be gone'</FONT>: in all his experience, he
later told Charlotte and Ellen, <FONT COLOR="#000060">'he had never seen
such a deathbed and it gave evidence of no common mind'</FONT>.<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="sourcebi.html#17">17</A>
</FONT></SUP>&nbsp;Remarking on Anne's final hours, one of her biographers
says, <FONT COLOR="#000060">'Anne is almost awesomely in command. She rises
supremely to her last occasion, and as long as she is conscious, she directs
it.'<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2> <A HREF="sourcebi.html#18">18</A></FONT></SUP>
</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="19"></A>Over the following few days, Charlotte made the decision
to <FONT COLOR="#000060">'lay the flower where it had fallen'</FONT>: She
later wrote: <FONT COLOR="#000060">'I wanted her to die where she would
be happiest. . . . She loved Scarborough.'</FONT><SUP><FONT SIZE=-2> <A HREF="sourcebi.html#19">19</A>
</FONT></SUP>&nbsp;Anne's funeral was conducted in nearby Christ Church,
the very establishment where she had worshipped with the Robinsons several
years earlier. Her former schoolmistress at Roe Head, Miss Wooler, was
also in Scarborough at this time, and she was the only other mourner at
Anne's funeral. Anne was then carried, by horse-cart, through the town,
gradually rising to St. Mary's churchyard; and there, beneath the castle
walls, and overlooking the bay she had always loved, she was laid in her
final resting place.</P>

<P><A NAME="20"></A>A year later, further editions of the sisters' novels
were required; however, Charlotte prevented re-publication of Anne's second
novel, <I>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</I>. This act was the predominant
cause of Anne's relegation to the back-seat of the Bront&euml; bandwagon.
In writing this novel, Anne had presented themes that were very daring
for the Victorian era. She gave them bold treatment, and pulled no punches
in her depiction of scenes of mental and physical cruelty: many critics
had accused her of having <FONT COLOR="#000060">'a morbid love of the coarse,
not to say of the brutal'</FONT>.<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="sourcebi.html#20">20</A>
</FONT></SUP>&nbsp;Charlotte told her publishers that its subject matter
was totally alien to Anne's nature: and it was reputedly to prevent any
further attacks on Anne's character that Charlotte suppressed her book.
Curiously, <I>Wuthering Heights</I> had brought similar accusations on
Emily, but Charlotte did not take the same action on Emily's behalf - the
sister to whom she had always seemed to be closest. <A NAME="21"></A>The
consequence was that Charlotte's novels, along with Emily's <I>Wuthering
Heights</I>, continued to be published, firmly launching these two sisters
into literary stardom, while Anne's masterpiece had been 'consigned to
oblivion'. Elizabeth Langland writes: <FONT COLOR="#000060">'It is worth
pausing briefly to reflect on what might have been Anne's fate had the
<I>Tenant of Wildfell Hall</I> been re-published with <I>Agnes Grey</I>
so that critics could take that opportunity to measure the substantial
artistic growth between the two novels. Charlotte herself never accomplished
Anne's imaginative range. Further, Anne was only twenty-eight when she
wrote <I>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</I>; at a comparable age, Charlotte
had produced only <I>The Professor</I>. And yet, despite the disadvantages
in representation Anne suffered at Charlotte's hands'.<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2><A HREF="sourcebi.html#21">21</A></FONT></SUP>
</FONT></P>

<P>In recent years, a re-appraisal of Anne's work has begun, gradually
leading to her acceptance, 'not as a minor Bront&euml;, but as a major
literary figure in her own right'. Indeed, her last piece of prose to be
