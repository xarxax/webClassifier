  <P>This is it, the final issue of this newsletter.</P>
  <P>I want to thank Barbara Lundt, Daniel A. Wilson, Erin Michael
  Winking, Rob Maxwell and Teresa Copeland for helping out the
  last few months,</P>
  <P>This is also the end of my weekly Anime and Manga Shopping
  Report as it depended on the information in my newsletter databases.</P>
  <P>I can now focus on my column for Newtype USA, finishing The
  Anime Companion vol.2 and working on some essays.</P>
  <P>It is hard to believe that I first began this newsletter project
  eight and a half years ago. I started this out of frustration
  over the difficulty involved in finding out what was coming out.
  I was able to print the first issue on three sheets of paper
  in 12 pt Palatino. The last time I checked a few months ago,
  when I was still covering anime, it was over 130 pages at 10
  pt.</P>
  <P>Even with help I was not able to sufficiently reduce the work
  load on the newsletter. Even when I stopped covering anime. But
  covering manga was a problem in that I did not want to drop the
  newsletter until I found another reliable source of information
  for fans, havine folks go to each companies web site was not
  good enough.</P>
  <P>Now I have found a source. Manga Bits is doing a good job
  of posting release schedules by month. This is not as exact as
  I was doing since I was trying to list items by specific day
  but still it is a good way to list material.</P>
  <P>One thing to note with manga is that the release dates are
  presently not as reliable as they used to be. With the dramatic
  increases in manga publishing it is not uncommon for items to
  reach the stores weeks early or late. All lists no matter how
  precise they try to be are rough estimates. For example in this
  issue many of the Viz titles have had their fates moved forward,
  and Dark Horse has delayed some of their titles.</P>
  <P>Finally I would like to thank everyone for their support over
  the years and hope you continue to use my other web resources
  and buy my printed publications.<BR>

  <P>Whenever possible dates are from information supplied or published
  by the companies listed, via email, in their ads, Web pages or
  Usenet postings.</P>
  <P>When information is not from the companies I have noted the
  source.</P>
  <P>Information is organized by:<BR>
  Street Release Date [Year-month/day (if available)] TITLE IN
  CAPS<BR>

  Format (Comic, Graphic Novel, Magazine, Etc.)<BR>
  *Company Name*<BR>
  Verification [If I have seen the item on store shelves]</P>

  TITLE followed by the release date for easy checking for items
  you are anxious to have.<BR>
  </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<P>I include information for releases from the previous month's
releases due to the fact that it sometimes takes far too long
for titles to reach many localities due to distribution or production
delays.</P>

service as long as no extra fees are charged for downloading it.</P>

them the URL of this document for their reference. I will also
directly email this newsletter monthly to retailers upon request.<BR>
