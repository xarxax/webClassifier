<img src="cain1.jpg" align="left">During the 1930's and 40's James M. Cain was,
along with <a href="../woolrich/index.shtml">Cornell Woolrich</a>, <a
href="../chandler/index.shtml">Raymond Chandler</a>, and <a
href="../hammett/index.shtml">Dashiell
Hammett</a>, one of the creators of the <em>roman noir</em> genre. 
Cain was born in Annapolis on July 1, 1892. He
was raised in Chestertown, Maryland, and graduated from Washington College, where his
father was president.  After serving in World War I, he returned to Baltimore where he
began working as a reporter. He first worked for the Baltimore American and then for the
Baltimore Sun until 1923. After a time in New York, Cain moved to Hollywood.  There he
tried screenwriting, but found greater success when he turned to fiction. His first novel,
<u>The Postman Always Rings Twice</u>, was published in 1934 and was a runaway bestseller.
Cain returned to Maryland in 1948, settling in Hyattsville. He continued to write and was a
familiar figure on the College Park campus. James M. Cain died October 27th, 1977. </P>

<P>Cain did not write mysteries or detective fiction; he wrote novels of
crime, sex and violence. The majority of Cain's plots follow the same predictable
plan: a man falls for a woman, becomes involved in criminal activity with
the woman, and is eventually betrayed by the woman. Although predictable,
this basic plot line was used to great success, and continues to be serviceable
today -- such as in the Cain-inspired films <i>Body Heat</i> or <i>Blood Simple</i>.
Cain's writing style is hard boiled, pared down to essential phrases with
terse, almost brutal simplicity. </P>
