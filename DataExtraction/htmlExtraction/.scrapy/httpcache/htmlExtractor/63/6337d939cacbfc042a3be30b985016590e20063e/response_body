        <h1>Harry Mathews</h1>
        <p>Born in New York City in 1930, Harry Mathews has
        spent much of his adult life in Europe, chiefly in France. He now
        divides his time between France and Key West, Florida.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mathews began publishing his
        poetry in 1956. He soon afterwards became associated with the so-called
        New York School of poets, and particularly with John Ashbery, with whom
        he has remained a close friend. In 1962 he published the first of five
        novels, <i>The Conversions</i> (the most recent, <i>The Journalist</i>,
        appeared in 1994; he is currently working on a new book tentatively
        entitled <i>My Life in CIA</i>). He has published several volumes of
        poems, translations, and criticism.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1970 Mathews met the French
        writer Georges Perec; there began a period of literary collaboration and
        friendship that only ended with the Frenchman’s death in 1982. Perec
        introduced Mathews to the Ouvroir de Littérature Potentielle (the
        Oulipo), a group of mathematicians and writers devoted to the
        investigation of constrictive forms and procedures. (The Oulipo,
        co-founded by Raymond Queneau, has counted Marcel Duchamp, Italo
        Calvino, and Jacques Roubaud among its members.)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1978 Mathews began teaching
        in the United States. His subjects have included French literature,
        comparative literature, and writing.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1949 to 1961 Mathews was
        married to Niki de Saint Phalle, by whom he had two children. He is now
        married to the French novelist Marie Chaix.</p>
