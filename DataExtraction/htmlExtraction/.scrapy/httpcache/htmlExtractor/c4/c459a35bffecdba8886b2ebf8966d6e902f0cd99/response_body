<P>If your web browser is capable of viewing applets, Tim should be loading
as you read this.</P>

<P>Tim is more or less self-explanatory. First enter your member ID and
password in the appropriate boxes, then press &quot;Okay.&quot; The section
at the top of this page should have three boxes, two buttons, and a checkbox.
Enter the name of the stock or bond in the first box. Enter the number
to buy or sell in the second box. For a normal transaction, just press
buy or sell. Tim can handle purchases larger than the normal limit. If
the &quot;slow&quot; box is checked, Tim will only sell 5000 of a given
stock every 5 minutes, or 100 of a bond. This reduces the effect you have
on the price. The third text box lets you limit the price range. Enter
the highest price you'll buy at or the lowest price you'll sell at, then
leave Tim in the background. If the price falls into that range, Tim will
carry out the transaction.</P>

<P>Tim makes use of the networking capabilites of Java. May browsers will
not allow this. You can try adjusting your preferencs to permit networking
by applets. I hope to enable all browsers to use Tim by the final version.</P>
