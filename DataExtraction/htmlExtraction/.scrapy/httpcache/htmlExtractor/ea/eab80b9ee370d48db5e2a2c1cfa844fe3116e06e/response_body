The work he does is all-encompassing; from selecting the best ingredients, preparing and  cooking the dishes in your home, to pairing wines as needed, and serving and cleaning your kitchen. 
This ensures you'll not only enjoy the freshest, highest quality prepared foods, but also the excitement of witnessing a professionally trained personal chef in action.

His knowledge and passion for food and cooking is exemplified through his dedication to pairing food and wine.

Over the years, he has developed a sincere appreciation for expressive wines that complement his cuisine.
