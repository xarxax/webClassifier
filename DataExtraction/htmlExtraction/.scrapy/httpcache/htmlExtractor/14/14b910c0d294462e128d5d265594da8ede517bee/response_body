It was nine o'clock at night upon the second of August--the most
terrible August in the history of the world.  One might have
thought already that God's curse hung heavy over a degenerate
world, for there was an awesome hush and a feeling of vague
expectancy in the sultry and stagnant air.  The sun had long set,
but one blood-red gash like an open wound lay low in the distant
west.  Above, the stars were shining brightly, and below, the
lights of the shipping glimmered in the bay.  The two famous
Germans stood beside the stone parapet of the garden walk, with
the long, low, heavily gabled house behind them, and they looked
down upon the broad sweep of the beach at the foot of the great
chalk cliff in which Von Bork, like some wandering eagle, had
perched himself four years before.  They stood with their heads
close together, talking in low, confidential tones.  From below
the two glowing ends of their cigars might have been the
smouldering eyes of some malignant fiend looking down in the
darkness.
</P><P>
A remarkable man this Von Bork--a man who could hardly be matched
among all the devoted agents of the Kaiser.  It was his talents
which had first recommended him for the English mission, the most
important mission of all, but since he had taken it over those
talents had become more and more manifest to the half-dozen
people in the world who were really in touch with the truth.  One
of these was his present companion, Baron Von Herling, the chief
secretary of the legation, whose huge 100-horse-power Benz car
was blocking the country lane as it waited to waft its owner back
to London.

"So far as I can judge the trend of events, you will probably be
back in Berlin within the week," the secretary was saying.  "When
you get there, my dear Von Bork, I think you will be surprised at
the welcome you will receive.  I happen to know what is thought
in the highest quarters of your work in this country."  He was a
huge man, the secretary, deep, broad, and tall, with a slow,
heavy fashion of speech which had been his main asset in his
political career.
</P><P>
Von Bork laughed.
</P><P>
"They are not very hard to deceive," he remarked.  "A more
docile, simple folk could not be imagined."
</P><P>
"I don't know about that," said the other thoughtfully.  "They
have strange limits and one must learn to observe them.  It is
that surface simplicity of theirs which makes a trap for the
stranger.  One's first impression is that they are entirely soft.
Then one comes suddenly upon something very hard, and you know
that you have reached the limit and must adapt yourself to the
fact.  They have, for example, their insular conventions which
simply MUST be observed."
</P><P>
"Meaning 'good form' and that sort of thing?" Von Bork sighed as
one who had suffered much.
</P><P>
"Meaning British prejudice in all its queer manifestations.  As
an example I may quote one of my own worst blunders--I can afford
to talk of my blunders, for you know my work well enough to be
aware of my successes.  It was on my first arrival.  I was
invited to a week-end gathering at the country house of a cabinet
minister.  The conversation was amazingly indiscreet."
