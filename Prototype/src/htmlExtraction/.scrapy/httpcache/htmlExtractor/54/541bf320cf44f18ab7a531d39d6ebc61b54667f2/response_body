<blockquote>
[Corry first summarizes the narrative of Invisible Man.  This 
excerpt begins as Corry is finishing this summary.  He has 
described the narrator's strange journey through Liberty Paints 
and now arrives at the end of the novel, and summarizes it thus:] <p>
</blockquote>

Thus he is ready for a new life.  The latter part of the book 
touches, among other things, his involvement in the Brotherhood, 
i.e., the Communist party, his eventual disenchantment, a 
magnificently weird black nationalist, a riot in Harlem, and the 
hero's retreat into a coal cellar.  Here, he says, he can enjoy 
his invisibility.  Then he falls asleep, dreams that he meets all 
his antagonists and that he tells them he is through running.  
"Not quite," one says, and they advance on him with a knife.  Then 
they castrate him, and he is free of all illusion. <p>

<blockquote>[Now he moves on to Ellison himself:]</blockquote><p>

Fourteen years after the publication of the Moby Dick of the 
racial crisis, its author sits in the study of an apartment on the 
eighth floor of a building that is neither in nor out of Harlem, 
but on the fringe, along Riverside Drive, in an area distinguished 
more for its vitality than for its charm.  He lives there quietly 
and well, thinking long thoughts that he sometimes puts into 
essays or reviews, and working on a novel that he has been writing 
and rewriting for 10 years. <p>

"I am a novelist not an activist," he says, "but I think that no 
one who reads what I write or who listens to my lectures can doubt 
that I am enlisted in the freedom movement.  As an individual, I 
am primarily responsible for the health of American literature and 
culture.  When I write, I am trying to make sense out of chaos.  
To think that a writer must think about his Negroness is to fall 
into a trap." <p>

In a long and splendid exchange with the critic <a 
href=wald-on-howe.html>Irving 
Howe</a> in the pages of the <i>New Leader</i>, Ellison accused Howe of 
trying to 
"designate the role which Negro writers are to play more rigidly 
than any Southern politician--and for the best of reasons.  We 
must express 'black' anger and 'clenched militancy;' most of all 
we should not become too interested in the problems of the art of 
literature, even though it is through these that we seek our 
individual identities.  And between writing well and being 
ideologically militant, we must choose militancy.  Well, it all 
sounds quite familiar and I fear the social order which it 
forecasts more than I do that of Mississippi." <p>

Furthermore, he is disturbed, Ellison says, by the increasing 
emphasis on Negroness, on blackness, in the civil-rights movement.  
"It grows out of despair," he says.  "It attempts to define 
Negroes by their pigmentation, not their culture.  What makes you 
a Negro is having grown up under certain cultural conditions, of 
having undergone an experience that shapes your culture.  There is 
a body of folklore, a certain sense of American history.  There is 
our psychology and the peculiar circumstances under which we have 
lived.  There is our cuisine, though we don't admit it, and our 
forms of expression.  I speak certain idioms; this is also part of 
the concord that makes me a Negro." <p>

Ellison, however, does not speak in idioms freely, which can also be part of the concord, just as there
are certain jokes that are told only by Negroes to Negroes (sometimes they are very funny).  Ellison
measures his words very carefully and he does not gesture much beyond a little dab in the air with a long
slender cigar.  When he is annoyed, he hunches his shoulders and his radio-announcer voice rises from
about baritone to tenor.  He can be idiomatic then, and when he is, he amuses himself.  "The Moynihan
report complained that Negroes don't strut anymore." Annoyed, voice rising.  "Why Negro faggots are the
struttingest people I know." Laughing at himself. <p>
