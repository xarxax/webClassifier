<b>This is another</b> in a series of guest
columns that examine the forging of
public policy in the nation's capital.
<b>Carolyn Chute</b> has written "The Beans of Egypt, 
Maine," "Letourneau's Used Auto Parts" and,
most recently, "Merry Men."  The next column, by Neil 
Rolde, an author and former state legislator, is

Congress, we were told when we were in our formative
years, is where the senators and representatives go 
to represent us.  We live in a democracy which means 
when it comes to the sovereign power of our government,
we are that power.  Not a king.  Not a queen.  Not a 
dictator.  But us, THE PEOPLE.  Through our votes we 
have our voice.  And through our freedom of speech and 
the rights to assemble and to petition.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Also those fiery idealistic ingenious hardworking 
radicals of our past cooked up another wonderful 
idea for us:  state govenunent.  This was nice.  More 
personal.  More handy.  More part of the local 
grapevine.  Easier to keep tabs on.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But the best thing of all about state government was 
its job of approving or disapproving and revoking 
corporate charters.  For years and years, if corporations 
didn't do things in the best interests of communities, but 
treated their workers like animals, made nasties in the 
rivers, bullied', cheated or lied, THE PEOPLE made a 
racket and their legislators tore those charters up into 
confetti.

<p>
Meanwhile, rich folk were paying income taxes and property 
taxes like the rest of us and life went on.

Have you had a queer feeling lately that the sovereign 
power of THE PEOPLE has shifted?  Have you felt as 
though corporations have become people and you are 
just a concept?  Seems nobody in government even 
recognizes the existence of "employees," small farms 
or small business today.  Or small anything.  (Oh, 
excuse me.  Today your small business is called 
micro-biz.)  Welfare, <i>real</i> welfare, goes to 
corporations instead of your family or neighbors when 
they need it.  Your grown kids can't afford a 
house.  Lucky if they can afford a camper.  (But then
try living in a camper and the government will fine
you.)

<font size="-3">
<p>
</font>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Meanwhile, your local and state tax bases aren't
stretching because the people who pay the taxes are
losing their jobs or working part time, and the 
people who make mountains of money pay NO TAXES.  Your
little squeaks of dismay are unheard.  Your values are
being called "provincial."  Your grandfather's 32
Special hanging on the wall is being called
"dangerous."  Your kids are being called 
"unprepared."  Your fears are being called "silly," 
"neurotic" or "fringe."  Hundreds of articles are 
telling us that America is cynical . . . that 
cynicism is naughty, is unpatriotic, is 
ungrateful.  "Look" they say, "just look at the 
starving masses in Bookibimmi.  Look at the
country that has the wild-man ruler and women who
wear things over their faces and aren't allowed to
show off their legs.  Feel lucky!!!"

So you feel chastened.  You hang your head.  But
you don't have a job!  Or your job is in a place with
no windows.  No benefits.  Practically no pay.  Or 
just no variety, a job where one day is the predictable
echo of the last, a living-death job.  Your nghts in 
the shadow of corporate rights are only a notch above 
animal rights and you are aware that animal rights are 
dismal.  Inflation is dogged.  Government deficits 
billow.  Advertisers expand our children's minds with
all that they shall covet in the guise of all that 
they shall NEED.  You dismantle your TV.  But now TV is 
in the schools!  Two paper companies own the state of 
Maine, two hog companies own Iowa, one chemical 
company owns Wisconsin.

Three hundred percent profit on your heart 
medicine.  Machines answer the telephones wherever
you call.  Machines have all the jobs.  Machines are
getting all the trees, all the fish, shipping all your
state's resources off to Wakakawasakimawa and
there's nothing left but stumps and highways and 
Wal-Much and Video-Grab-N-Go.  Your babies are in day 
care, then school, then colleges, then gone.  Gone 
where?  To Ploontooki, Minn., or San Crisco, 
Calif., or some "neighborhood" of the vast global 
corporate village, yes, your children gone, raising 
your Polaroid grandchildren and keeping the Mother's 
Day card corporations joyously dancing.

"But listen!" the articles remind you.  "You are not 
the starving Bookibimmians!  You have food!  Pretty 
food.  And supermarkels with aisles as wide as cite 
streets.  And you can show off your legs.  Stop 
complaining.  In this country you have opportunities 
everywhere.  Stop thinking negatively.  You make your 
own luck.

"What do you mean every five years things are worse 
so therefore in five years it'll be worse and then
in five more years . . .  You need therapy maybe?  Or
one of the publishing industry's books on how to
breathe differently in order to control your 
thoughts?  You say you are worried there won't be 
enough money for basics like breakfast.  And the 
computer which soon will be required to keep you in 
touch.  Hogwash.  Things are getting better.  The 
recession is over!  Congress is fixing things!  And 
the president . . . if only we can find the right 
president, he'll FIX it all for us!!"

<font size="-3">

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yeah, I've been reading these articles and, my
friends, I'm a little tired of this double-think bull.

<font size="-3">
<p>
</font>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
First of all I should confess to you that I read only
articles and newsletters that don't have 
pictures.  And I have no TV.  So if Bill Clinton, 
Jesse Helms, Bob Dole and O.J. Simpson all walked 
into this room right now, I would not know which was
which.  I consider their faces and their three-line
quotes to be as trivial as sports stars and sports
scores.  I'm not the kind of radical that believes 
in blowing up government buildings.  In the 1990s 
if you think for yourself, you're a radical.

<p>
I have a solution.  Hear me out.  Shut off the TV a
minute.  Listen.  I would like to see the doors to
Congress locked.  For 10 years.  Yes with our elected
officials inside.  They can't get out.  We'll keep them
comfortable.  Lots of nice foods.  Music.  Movies.  The
ballet.  Comedians.  Big bands.  Big orgies if they 
want.  I don't care what they do in there.  As long as
MEGATROPOLIS INSURANCE MUTUAL AND TRUST and DUOTRON 
FOODS and MATRIX COMMUNICATIONS and CHEVASAKI AUTO 
and MONSANTDUPONZINCMECURICO CORP. can't get in.

<p>
Same with the State Houses.  Doors locked.

<font size="-3">
<p>
</font>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Meanwhile, THE PEOPLE get busy as bees.  ALL
TVs are off.  Instead we MEET.  We get educated on 
what our sovereign rights really are.  We learn the
real history of business and business-charter 
making, where it's been and where it is now.  There 
would be a great stir in all our households and
meeting places and in the streets.  We would be 
writing up proposals to our state legislators
that would sound somcthing like this:

<p>
"We urge local and state elected officials to adopt 
this Resolulion:  `Whereas only citizens have sovereign 
authority to grant charters of incorporation:  now, 
Therefore, be it resolved, that the legislature of 
this state redefine, the process and criteria for 
granting corporate charters to our 
specifications;  restore civic authority over the 
governance of existing corporate charters to our 
specifications;  and finally, revoke the charters of 
harmful corporations and revoke the certificatcs of 
authority of harmful foreign and alien corporations
operating in our state.'"

<p>
Then we write out our demands of Congress that the 
rich be taxed . . . REALLY taxed.

<font size="-3">
<p>
</font>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We decide also to challenge the prevailing judicial 
doctrines

<font size="-3">
<p>
</font>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And we strengthen ourselves against the blackmail that
corporations always use on us if we don't let them do
anything they want:  They'll leave the state and take 
all our jobs.  Good riddance!  Where the great oak
falls, many little cheery saplings will sprout.

<font size="-3">
<p>
</font>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now THE PEOPLE surround the State Houses and Congress 
in huge mean-looking mobs, vast masses of Americans 
filling filling the streets.

<font size="-3">
<p>
</font>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"Silently, our eyes stare straight at the doors that 
are being unlocked.  Out steps the Congress men and
women, slightly older.  They look down from the 
doorways and see THE PEOPLE.  We are shoulder to 
shouder, rank and file.  We call out, "HELLO THERE
SENATORS!  REPRESENTATIVES!  WE HAVE SOMETHING WE
WANT YOU TO DO!"

<font size="-3">
<p>
</font>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The senators and representatives, of course, are all
smiling.  They say happily. "Anything you want, you 
can have!  It's really such a great idea, this 
democracy idea . . . once you give it a bit of thought."
