<ul><DL><P>
<DT><font size="+1">S</font>HE walks in beauty like the night
<DT>Of cloudless climes and starry skies,
<DT>And all that's best of dark and bright
<DT>Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
<DT>Thus mellowed to the tender light
<DT>Which heaven to gaudy day denies.<P>
<DT>One ray the more, one shade the less
<DT>Had half impaired the nameless grace
<DT>Which waves in every raven tress
<DT>Or softly lightens o'er her face,
<DT>Where thoughts serenely sweet express
<DT>How pure, how dear their dwelling place.<P>
<DT>And on that cheek and o'er that brow
<DT>So soft, so calm yet eloquent,
<DT>The smiles that win, the tints that glow
<DT>But tell of days in goodness spent
<DT>A mind at peace with all below,
<DT>A heart whose love is innocent.

<H2><IMG  SRC="marker2.gif"><I><A NAME="2"> <font color="#004080">I Would I Were a Careless Child</font></A></I></H2>
<ul><DL><P>
<DT><font size="+1">I</font> WOULD I were a careless child,
<DD>Still dwelling in my highland cave,
<DT>Or roaming through the dusky wild,
<DD>Or bounding o'er the dark blue wave;
<DT>The cumbrous pomp of Saxon pride
<DD>Accords not with the freeborn soul,
<DT>Which loves the mountain's craggy side,
<DD>And seeks the rocks where billows roll.<p>
<DT>Fortune! take back these cultured lands,
<DD>Take back this name of splendid sound!
<DT>I hate the touch of servile hands,
<DD>I hate the slaves that cringe around.
<DT>Place me among the rocks I love,
<DD>Which sound to Ocean's wildest roar;
<DT>I ask but this -- again to rove
<DD>Through scenes my youth hath known before.<p>
<DT>Few are my years, and yet I feel
<DD>The world was ne'er designed for me:
<DT>Ah! why do dark'ning shades conceal
<DD>The hour when man must cease to be?
<DT>Once I beheld a splendid dream,
<DD>A visionary scene of bliss:
<DT>Truth! -- wherefore did thy hated beam
<DD>Awake me to a world like this?<p>
<DT>I loved -- but those I loved are gone;
<DD>Had friends -- my early friends are fled:
<DT>How cheerless feels the heart alone
<DD>When all its former hopes are dead!
<DT>Though gay companions o'er the bowl
<DD>Dispel awhile the sense of ill;
<DT>Though pleasure stirs the maddening soul,
<DD>The heart -- the heart -- is lonely still.<p>
<DT>How dull! to hear the voice of those
<DD>Whom rank or chance, whom wealth or power,
<DT>Have made, though neither friends nor foes,
<DD>Associates of the festive hour.
<DT>Give me again a faithful few,
<DD>In years and feelings still the same,
<DT>And I will fly the midnight crew,
<DD>Where boist'rous joy is but a name.<p>
<DT>And woman, lovely woman! thou,
<DD>My hope, my comforter, my all!
<DT>How cold must be my bosom now,
<DD>When e'en thy smiles begin to pall!
<DT>Without a sigh I would resign
<DD>This busy scene of splendid woe,
<DT>To make that calm contentment mine,
<DD>Which virtue knows, or seems to know.<p>
<DT>Fain would I fly the haunts of men--
<DD>I seek to shun, not hate mankind;
<DT>My breast requires the sullen glen,
<DD>Whose gloom may suit a darken'd mind.
<DT>Oh! that to me the wings were given
<DD>Which bear the turtle to her nest!
<DT>Then would I cleave the vault of heaven,
<DD>To flee away and be at rest.

<H2><IMG  SRC="marker2.gif"><I><A NAME="3"> <font color="#004080">Adieu, Adieu! My Native Shore</font> </A></I></H2>
from <i>Childe Harold</i>, Canto <i>i</i>, Verse 13
<ul><DL><P>
<DT>'<font size="+1">A</font>DIEU, adieu! my native shore
<dd>Fades o'er the waters blue;
<DT>The Night-winds sigh, the breakers roar,
<dd>And shrieks the wild sea-mew.
<DT>Yon Sun that sets upon the sea
<dd>We follow in his flight;
<DT>Farewell awhile to him and thee,
<dd>My native Land -- Good Night!<p>
<DT>'A few short hours and He will rise
<dd>To give the Morrow birth;
<DT>And I shall hail the main and skies,
<dd>But not my mother Earth.
<DT>Deserted is my own good hall,
<dd>Its hearth is desolate;
<DT>Wild weeds are gathering on the wall;
<dd>My dog howls at the gate.<p>
<DT>'Come hither, hither, my little page!
<dd>Why dost thou weep and wail?
<DT>Or dost thou dread the billows' rage,
<dd>Or tremble at the gale?
<DT>But dash the tear-drop from thine eye;
<dd>Our ship is swift and strong,
<DT>Our fleetest falcon scarce can fly
<dd>More merrily along.' --<p>
<DT>'Let winds be shrill, let waves roll high,
<dd>I fear not wave nor wind;
<DT>Yet marvel not, Sir Childe, that I
<dd>Am sorrowful in mind;
<DT>For I have from my father gone,
<dd>A mother whom I love,
<DT>And have no friend, save these alone,
<dd>But thee -- and one above.<p>
<DT>'My father bless'd be fervently,
<dd>Yet did not much complain;
<DT>But sorely will my mother sigh
<dd>Till I come back again.' --
<DT>'Enough, enough, my little lad!
<dd>Such tears become thine eye;
<DT>If I thy guileless bosom had,
<dd>Mine own would not be dry. --<p>
<DT>'Come hither, hither, my staunch yeoman,
<dd>Why dost thou look so pale?
<DT>Or dost thou dread a French foeman?
<dd>Or shiver at the gale?'--
<DT>'Deem'st thou I tremble for my life?
<dd>Sir Childe, I'm not so weak;
<DT>But thinking on an absent wife
<dd>Will blanch a faithful cheek.<p>
<DT>'My spouse and boys dwell near thy hall,
<dd>Along the bordering lake,
<DT>And when they on their father call,
<dd>What answer shall she make?'--
<DT>'Enough, enough, my yeoman good,
<dd>Thy grief let none gainsay;
<DT>But I, who am of lighter mood,
<dd>Will laugh to flee away.<p>
<DT>'For who would trust the seeming sighs
<dd>Of wife or paramour?
<DT>Fresh feres will dry the bright blue eyes
<dd>We late saw streaming o'er.
<DT>For pleasures past I do not grieve,
<dd>Nor perils gathering near;
<DT>My greatest grief is that I leave
<dd>No thing that claims a tear.<p>
<DT>'And now I'm in the world alone,
<dd>Upon the wide, wide sea;
<DT>But why should I for others groan,
<dd>When none will sigh for me?
<DT>Perchance my dog will whine in vain,
<dd>Till fed by stranger hands;
<DT>But long ere I come back again
<dd>He'd tear me where he stands.<p>
<DT>'With thee, my bark, I'll swiftly go
<dd>Athwart the foaming brine;
<DT>Nor care what land thou bear'st me to,
<dd>So not again to mine.
<DT>Welcome, welcome, ye dark blue waves!
<dd>And when you fail my sight,
<DT>Welcome ye deserts, and ye caves!
<dd>My native land -- Good Night!'

<ul><DL><P>
<DT><font size="+1">W</font>HEN we two parted
<dd>In silence and tears,
<DT>Half broken-hearted
<dd>To sever for years,
<DT>Pale grew thy cheek and cold,
<dd>Colder thy kiss;
<DT>Truly that hour foretold
<dd>Sorrow to this.<p>
<DT>The dew of the morning
<dd>Sunk chill on my brow--
<DT>It felt like the warning
<dd>Of what I feel now.
<DT>Thy vows are all broken,
<dd>And light is thy fame;
<DT>I hear thy name spoken,
<dd>And share in its shame.<p>
<DT>They name thee before me,
<dd>A knell to mine ear;
<DT>A shudder comes o'er me--
<dd>Why wert thou so dear?
<DT>They know not I knew thee,
<dd>Who knew thee too well:--
<DT>Long, long shall I rue thee,
<dd>Too deeply to tell.<p>
<DT>In secret we met--
<dd>In silence I grieve
<DT>That thy heart could forget,
<dd>Thy spirit deceive.
<DT>If I should meet thee
<dd>After long years,
<DT>How should I greet thee?--
<dd>With silence and tears.

from <i>Childe Harold</i>, Canto <i>iv</i>, Verse 178
<ul><DL><P>
<dt><font size="+1">T</font>HERE is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
<dd>There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
<dd>There is society, where none intrudes,
<dd>By the deep sea, and music in its roar:
<dd>I love not man the less, but Nature more,
<dd>From these our interviews, in which I steal
<dd>From all I may be, or have been before,
<dd>To mingle with the Universe, and feel
<dt>What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal.

from <i>Childe Harold</i>, Canto <i>iii</i>, Verse 45
<ul><DL><P>
<DT><font size="+1">H</font>E who ascends to mountain-tops shall find
<DD>The loftiest peaks most wrapt in clouds and snow;
<DD>He who surpasses or subdues mankind,
<DD>Must look down on the hate of those below.
<DD>Though high above the sun of glory glow,
<DD>And far beneath the earth and ocean spread,
<DD>Round him are icy rocks, and loudly blow
<DD>Contending tempests on his naked head.
<DT>And thus rewards the toils which to those summits led.

<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  So late into the night,
<dt>Though the heart still be as loving,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;  And the moon still be as bright.<P>
<dt>For the sword outwears its sheath,

<dt>And the heart must pause to breathe,

<dt>Though the night was made for loving,

<DT><font size="+1">T</font>HE Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,
<DT>And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;
<DT>And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,
<DT>When the blue wave rolls nightly on the Galilee.<P>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<P>
<DT>Like the leaves of the forest when summer is green,

<DT>Like the leaves of the forest when autumn hath blown,

<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3<P>
<DT>For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,
<DT>And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed;
<DT>And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,
<DT>And their hearts but once heaved, and forever grew still!<P>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4<P>
<DT>And there lay the steed with his nostril all wide,
<DT>But through it there rolled not the breath of his  pride;
<DT>And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,
<DT>And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.<P>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5<P>
<DT>And there lay the rider distorted and pale,
<DT>With the dew on his brow, and the rust on his mail:
<DT>And the tents were all silent, the banners alone,
<DT>The lances unlifted, the trumpets unblown.<P>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6<P>
<DT>And the widows of Ashur are load in thier wail,
<DT>And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal;

<dd>With a magic like thee;

<dd>Is thy sweet voice to me:
<dt>When, as if its sound were causing
<dt>The charmèd ocean's pausing,

<dt>And the midnight moon is weaving
<dd>Her bright chain o'er the deep,
<dt>Whose breast is gently heaving
<dd>As an infant's asleep:
<dt>So the sprit bows before thee;
<dt>With a full but soft emotion,
