<P ALIGN=Justify><IMG SRC="empty5.gif">"Lafcadio Hearn is almost as Japanese as haiku. Both are an art form, an institution in Japan. Haiku is indigenous to the nation; Hearn became a Japanese citizen and married a Japanese, taking the name Yakumo Koizumi. His flight from Western materialism brought him to Japan in 1890. His search for beauty and tranquility, for pleasing customs and lasting values, kept him there the rest of his life, a confirmed Japanophile. He became the great interpreter of things Japanese to the West. His keen intellect, poetic imagination and wonderful clear style permitted him to penetrate to the very essence of things Japanese."

<P><B>Biography</B>
<BR><IMG SRC="empty5.gif">Hearn was born on the Greek island of Lefkas, on June 27, 1850, son of an Anglo-Irish surgeon major in the British army and a Greek mother. After his parents' divorce when he was six, he was brought up by a great-aunt in Dublin, Ireland. He lost the sight in his left eye at the age of 16, and soon after, his father died. A year later, due to his great-aunt's bankruptcy, he was forced to withdraw from school. At the age of nineteen he moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, where five years later he became a newspaper reporter. In 1877 Hearn went to New Orleans to write a series of articles, and remained there for ten years. Having achieved some success with his literary translations and other works, he was hired by <A NAME=Harper><A HREF="hearn/harper.htm">Harper Publishing Co.</A></A> He was in the West Indies on assignment from Harper from 1887-89, and wrote two novels on that period.

<BR><IMG SRC="empty5.gif">In 1889 he decided to go to Japan, and upon his arrival in <A NAME=Yokohama><A HREF="hearn/yokohama.htm">Yokohama</A></A> in the spring of 1890, was befriended by <A NAME=Chamber><A HREF="hearn/chamber.htm">Basil Hall Chamberlain</A></A> of Tokyo Imperial University, and officials at the Ministry of Education. At their encouragement, in the summer of 1890 he moved to <A NAME=Matsue><A HREF="hearn/matsue.htm">Matsue</A></A>, to teach English at Shimane Prefectural Common Middle School and Normal School. There he got to know Governor Koteda Yasusada and Sentaro Nishida of Shimane, and later married Setsu Koizumi, the daughter of a local samurai family.

<BR><IMG SRC="empty5.gif">Hearn stayed fifteen months in Matsue, moving on to another teaching position in Kumamoto, Kyushu, at the Fifth Higher Middle School, where he spent the next three years and completed his book <I>Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan</I> (1894).  In October of 1894 he secured a journalism position with the English-language Kobe <I>Chronicle</I>, and in 1896, with some assistance from Chamberlain, he began teaching English literature at Tokyo (Imperial) University, a post he held until 1903, and at Waseda University. On September 26, 1904, he died of heart failure at the age of 54.

<BR><IMG SRC="empty5.gif">Hearn's most famous work is a collection of lectures entitled <I>Japan: An Attempt at Interpretation</I> (1904). His other books on Japan include <I>Exotics and Retrospectives</I> (1898), <I>In Ghostly Japan</I> (1899), <I>Shadowings</I> (1900), <I>A Japanese Miscellany</I> (1901), and <I>Kwaidan</I> (1904).

Dear Steve Trussel,

This is Alan Rosen from Kumamoto University. I wanted to thank you for the
great website you maintain, and for acknowledging my small contribution to
its accuracy. Today I was looking at it, when I noticed that the photo of
Hearn, Setsu, and Kajio is mislabeled as "Matsue." Actually this photo was
definitely taken in Kobe. If you could make a correction to that effect, I
think it would improve your already significant contribution.

Happy holidays,
Alan Rosen

<p>Author. In 1890 he went to Japan to write a series of articles for an American publisher. He became so enamored with the country and its culture that he spent the rest of his life there, taking the name Yakumo Koizumi. Hearn's 12 books written during this period include "Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan" (1894), "Kokoro" (1896), "Japanese Fairy Tales" (1902), and "Japan: An Attempt at Interpretation" (1904).

<br>April 19, 2010 &#150; Greetings <!--to Steve Trussel--> from Israel!  I appreciate your informative site about Lafcadio Hearn. Readers with an interest in Lafcadio Hearn may want to know about a long essay about Hearn in Hebrew, written by my late father, the Hebrew author and poet Abraham Regelson.  It appears in his book called "<i>Revivim va-Tal</i>" ("<i>Spring Showers and Dew: Talks and Poetry Gleanings</i>"),  printed in Israel in 1978. 
<p>Regelson was a great fan of Hearn's, and read everything he could get hold of by him.  He also translated or paraphrased a poem by Hearn, and called it "<b>A Japanese Note</b>" (that might have been Regelson's own title).  I assume he translated it from English, as he didn't know Japanese.  It was printed in the Tel Aviv newspaper "<i>Al Hamishmar</i>" in 1953.  As I onlly have the Hebrew version, I wonder if anyone can identify it and post it in English for me.  
<p>The poem tells of a meeting in the Temple to Rice called <i>Mimogiri-Inori</i> with a person he had never met before.  From that meeting they became soul-mates, closer to each other than man and wife. Together they visited a site called Sumida River.  If anybody can identify this poem and let me know what the English text is, I'd be very grateful.

<br>February 12, 2010 &#150; Could the poetic science passage sought by Doug <a href="#description">last March</a> be, in part, here:
<blockquote>I an individual,— an individual soul! Nay, I am a population,— a population unthinkable for multitude, even by groups of a thousand millions! Generations of generations I am, eons of eons! Countless times the concourse now making me has been scattered, and mixed with other scattering. Of what concern, then, the next disintegration? Perhaps, after trillions of ages of burning in different dynasties of suns, the very best of me may come together again."</blockquote>
(From "Dust", an article in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/1896nov/hearn.htm"><i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, November, 1896</a>)
<p>NB: This passage contains a good example of the Hearn signature in punctuation; his use of a connecting comma and em dash for elaboration, emphasis or digression in a sentence. 
<p>I respectfully sugggest "Dust" to all who have not read it.

<br>February 11, 2010 &#150; What a tragedy Mark tells about Eoin Mullarney, who died in Greece, where Patrick Lafcadio was born born 160 years ago on the Ionian island of Lefkas. Eoin's dream of a Memorial museum for Lafcadio museum in Dublin is a great idea.
 <p>The dream of a museum in Dublin is particularly relevant in this the 160th anniversary of Hearn's. Patrick Lafcadio Hearn arrived in Dublin at the age of two. He and Eoin, as far as I can acertain, both had their formative years in Dublin.
 <p>And Greece unites them in poignant tragedy too: Patrick's youngest brother, Charles Robert, died there in infancy the same year Lafcadio was born.
 <p>Mark, is the apandoned church in neighbourhood of Gardiner St, Rathmines or Leeson St (Hearn's main Dublin residence)?
 <p>Such a museum could be the focus for the study of Hearn's Dublin years, incorporating the summers in Tramore, Co Waterford, and in Cong, Co Mayo, and other influences of his youthful development in post-Famine Ireland.
 <p>It would also be fitting reminder for the family and friends of Eoin if his dream were to be realised.
 <p>Perhaps interested parties might like to make contact here - on Mr Trussel's fine Lafcadian rendevous.

<BR>January 10, 2010 &#150; 	Hello! I studied English language and literature at the UCL in Belgium but I had never heard about Lafcadio Hearn until I read a book about mindmapping by Tony Buzan. Nothing to do with Hearn, you will say!  Nothing indeed except that the book introduces what Buzan calls a "novel", Kusa-Hibari, which he uses for an exercice in learning how to read and memorize efficiently.
<p>The text was in French and I enjoyed it a lot.  So now I would like to read it in English and to read not only that very story but the whole book it is part of. But I haven't been able to find the information anywhere yet.
<P>Could you please help me find that book?

<BR>September 14, 2009 &#150; 	I'm not sure if this will help, but I found two descriptions in "The Life and Letters of Lafcadio Hearn" by Elizabeth Bisland, vol. 1, the first by the Hearn himself on page 428: "I am about five feet three inches high, and weigh about 137 pounds in good health; --fever had me down to 126.  Nothing phthisical, --36 3/4 inches round the chest, stripped."  Ms. Bisland herself gives a long and fascinating description on pages 77-79: Here's a portion. "[In the winter of 1882]  He was at this time a most unusual and memorable person.  About five feet three inches in height, with unusually broad and powerful shoulders for such a stature, there was an almost feminine grace and lightness in his step and movements.  His feet were small and well shaped, but he wore invariably the most clumsy and neglected shoes, and his whole dress was peculiar.  His favourite coat, both winter and summer, was a heavy double-breasted 'reefer,' while the size of his wide-brimmed, soft-crowned hat was a standing joke among his friends.  The rest of his garments were apparently purchased for the sake of durability rather than beauty, with the exception of his linen, which, even in days of direst poverty, was always fresh and good.  Indeed a peculiar physical cleanliness was characteristic of him--that cleanliness of uncontaminated savages and wild animals, which has the air of being so essential and innate as to make the best-groomed men and domesticated beasts seem almost frowzy by contrast.  His hands were very delicate and supple, with quick timid movements that were yet full of charm, and his voice was musical and very soft.  He spoke always in short sentences, and the manner of his speech was very modest and deferential.  His head was quite remarkably beautiful; the profile both bold and delicate, with admirable modelling of the nose, lips and chin.  The brow was square, and full above the eyes, and the complexion a clear smooth olive. . . . before the accident his eyes must have been handsome, for they were large, of a dark liquid brown, and heavily lashed.  In conversation, he frequently, almost instinctively, placed his hand over the injured eye to conceal it from his companion. . . ."

<BR>March 12, 2009 &#150; I live in Sasebo, Japan and have come upon I think what may be a rare book with regards to this fine journalist, author, and artist. I have located a book entitled “Concerning Lafcadio Hearn” by George M. Gould. I believe this to be a first edition signed by the author. First published in May, 1908. The inside cover has an inscription which reads “For Mrs. Older with affection of Laura Stedman”. This volume contains a bibliography by Laura Stedman.
<br>I have just recently become interested in rare books. I know of Hearn’s’ writings as I have become a Japanophile of sorts myself. I am retired US Military and when I first came to Japan I picked up a copy of Hearn’s’ work, “Kwaidan”. I found it very interesting.
<br>If you can shed any light on this book that have I would certainly appreciate your efforts.

<BR>Nov. 8, 2007 &#150; 	I'm wondering if somebody knows about Hearn's planned lecture notes at Cornell University.  What I've heard was that he was invited to give a lecture at the university around 1904. He was planning to go but he had to give up on the idea because of his deteriorating health condition.  Does anybody know anything about the lecture notes?

<BR>April 13, 2007 &#150; As you might have noticed, the <I>New York Times</I> on 20 February 2007 
reported correspondent's journey to Hearn's hometown in Japan, Matsue. I 
hereby would like to provide another update from Japan.
<P>In 1924, Toyama University (Toyama, Japan) purchased Hearn's books 
(Japanese, English, French etc.) and manuscripts from his widow. The 
collection was installed in the university library, as "The Lafcadio 
Hearn Library". Unfortunately, the Library has been used by a limited 
number of academics. 
<P>From April 2007, however, the university and the Toyama Hearn Society 
started to open the Library to public three times a month. The Library 
opens to the public on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Wednesday, from 1 to 4 PM.
<P>I could only find following homepages in Japanese.

<P>April 13, 2007. <BR>Lafcadio Hearn (1850–1904) was a master satirist who displayed a fiery wit both as a writer and as an artist. For seven months in 1880, he surprised and amused the readers of New Orleans with his wood-block "cartoons" and accompanying articles, which were variously funny, scathing, surreal, political, whimsical, and moral. This delightful book collects in their entirety, for the first time, all of the extant satirical columns and woodcut illustrations published in the Daily City Item—181 columns in all. Hearn displays immense range, illuminating in words and prints the unique culture of New Orleans, including its Creole history, debauched underworld, corrupt politicians, and voudou practitioners. The columns are expertly annotated by Delia LaBarre, who places them in their unique Crescent City context.
<P>With virtually no training in art of any kind, Hearn began creating his illustrations partly to boost the circulation of a small daily newspaper in a competitive market. He believed in the power of satirical cartoons to communicate big ideas in small spaces—in particular, to reveal the habits, prejudices, and delusions of the current generation. Blind in his left eye (since a boyhood accident) and severely myopic in his right, Hearn nonetheless painstakingly carved out drawings on wood blocks with a penknife to be printed alongside his articles on the newspaper's letterpress. Hearn developed, from the first of these woodcuts to the last, a unique style that expressed the full range of his wit, from razor-sharp condemnation to tender affection...
<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="http://s50780.sites40.storefront-hosting.com/detail.aspx?ID=1589">More Here</A>
<!--Hearn had a keen eye for the absurd, along with an extraordinary ability to modulate his criticism and praise in a continuum from cauterizing vitriol to palliative balm, from the heaviest sarcasm to the lightest wit. In the pieces collected here, there can be found a unifying thread: Hearn's love/hate relationship with the virtues and vices of New Orleans, a city that continually amused and amazed him.

Born in Greece and raised in Ireland, Lafcadio Hearn immigrated to the United States as a teenager and became a newspaper reporter in Cincinnati, Ohio. When he married a black woman, an act that was illegal at the time, the newspaper fired him and Hearn relocated to New Orleans. In the early 1880s his contributions to national publications (like Harper's Weekly and Scribners Magazine) helped mold the popular image of New Orleans as a colorful place of decadence and hedonism. In 1888, Hearn left New Orleans for Japan, where he took the name Koizumi Yakumo and worked as a teacher, journalist, and writer.

    "And it may come to pass that I shall have stranger things to tell you; for this is a land of magical moons and of witches and of warlocks; and were I to tell you all that I have seen and heard in these years in this enchanted City of Dreams you would verily deem me mad rather than morbid." —Lafcadio Hearn, 1880, describing New Orleans in a letter to a friend

<BR>February 20, 2007 &#150; I live in Buenos Aires, but bought a painting by Lafcadio Hearn when I lived in New York.  It is a landscape of Mt. Fuji from 1895, signed on the back in Japanese, with an English inscription.
If you could please inform me how to send photos by internet to the Hearn Residence, I would appreciate it.
Also, I have one  published rarity:   GOMBO ZHEBES Little Dictionary of Creole Proverbs, published in New York in 1885.   My copy came from the Long Island Historical Society, when they deaccessed many books and artworks.

<BR>Jan. 12, 2007 &#150; Greetings from Niigata, Japan. I am a Louisiana native and 10-year resident of Japan. An avid reader of Lafcadio Hearn, I feel fortunate to share his interest in the cultures of  South Louisiana and Japan.  Like many other readers of Hearn, I  welcomed the <A HREF="hearn/archives.htm#Center">announcement</A> of the founding of the New Orleans International Hearn Center in April of 2004.  I was therefore dismayed to learn of the Center's closure a year later, months before Katrina devastated the city. My attempts to contact the Center's original Executive Director, Delia LaBarre,  have so far proved fruitless. I have sent e-mails to a number of sites promising detailed information about post-Katrina New Orleans, all to no avail. An impenetrable fog seems to have enveloped the ill-fated Hearn Center.
