      </center>

 alt="Keats"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Keats lived only
twenty-five years and four months (1795-1821), yet his poetic
achievement is extraordinary. His writing career lasted a little more
than five years (1814-1820), and three of his great odes--"Ode to a
Nightingale," "Ode on a Grecian Urn," and "Ode on Melancholy"--were
written in one month. Most of his major poems were written between his
twenty-third and twenty-fourth years, and all his poems were written by
his twenty-fifth year. In this brief period, he produced poems that
rank him as one of the great English poets. He also wrote letters which
T.S. Eliot calls "the most notable and the most important ever written
by any English poet." </a></p>
      <p><a name="overview">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His genius
was not generally perceived during his lifetime or immediately after
his death. Keats, dying, expected his poetry to be forgotten, as the
epitaph he wrote for his tombstone indicates: "Here lies one whose name
was writ in water." But nineteenth century critics and readers did come
to appreciate him, though, for the most part, they had only a partial
understanding of his work. They saw Keats as a sensual poet; they
focused on his vivid, </a><a href="../lit_term.html#concrete">concrete</a>
imagery; on his portrayal of
the physical and the passionate; and on his immersion in the here and
now. One nineteenth century critic went so far as to assert not merely
that
Keats had "a mind constitutionally inapt for abstract thinking," but
that
he "had no mind." Keats's much-quoted outcry, "O for a life of
Sensation rather than of Thoughts!" (letter, November 22, 1817) has
been cited to support this view. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the twentieth century, the
perception of Keats's poetry expanded; he was and is praised for his
seriousness and thoughfulness, for his dealing with difficult human
conflicts and artistic issues, and for his impassioned mental pursuit
of truth. Keats advocated living "the ripest, fullest experience that
one is capable of"; he believed that what determines truth is
experience ("axioms are not axioms until they are proved upon our
pulses"). The publication of Keats's letters, with their keen
intellectional questioning and concern with moral and artistic
problems, contributed to this re-assessment. His letters throw light on
his own poetic practices and provide insight into writing in general.

      <h2><a name="rom"><b>Keats and Romanticism</b></a></h2>
      </center>
      <p><a name="rom">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keats belonged to
a literary movement called </a><a href="rom.html">romanticism</a>.
Romantic poets, because of their theories of literature and life, were
drawn to <a href="../lit_term.html#lyric">lyric poetry</a>; they even
developed
a new form of <a href="ode.html">ode</a>, often called the <a
 href="ode.html">romantic meditative ode</a>. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The literary critic Jack
Stillinger describes the typical movement of the romantic ode: The
poet, unhappy with the real world, escapes or attempts to escape into
the ideal. Disappointed in his mental flight, he returns to the real
world. Usually he returns because human beings cannot live in the ideal
or because he has not found what he was seeking. But the experience
changes his understanding of his situation, of the world, etc.; his
views/feelings at the end of the poem differ significantly from those
he held at the beginning of the poem. <a name="themes"></a></p>
      <center><a name="themes"></a>
      <h2><a name="themes"><b>Themes in Keats's Major Poems</b></a></h2>
      </center>
      <p><a name="themes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Douglas Bush
noted that "Keats's important poems are related to, or grow directly
out of...inner conflicts." For example, pain and pleasure are
intertwined in "Ode to a
Nightingale" and "Ode on a Grecian Urn"; love is intertwined with pain,
and
pleasure is intertwined with death in "La Belle Dame Sans Merci," "The
Eve
of St. Agnes," and "Isabella; or, the Pot of Basil." </a></p>
      <p><a name="themes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cleanth Brooks
defines the </a><a href="../lit_term.html#paradox"> paradox</a> that
is the theme of "Ode to a Nightingale" somewhat differently: "the world
of imagination offers a release from the painful world of actuality,
yet at the same time it renders the world of actuality more painful by
contrast." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other conflicts appear in
Keats's poetry: </p>
      <ul>
        <blockquote> <li>transient sensation or passion / enduring art
          </li>
          <li>dream or vision / reality </li>
          <li>joy / melancholy </li>
          <li>the ideal / the real </li>
          <li>mortal / immortal </li>
          <li>life / death </li>
          <li>separation / connection </li>
          <li>being immersed in passion / desiring to escape passion</li>
        </blockquote>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keats often associated love and pain both
in
his life and in his poetry. &nbsp;He wrote of a young woman he found
attactive,
"When she comes into a room she makes an impression the same as the
Beauty
of a Leopardess.... I should like her to ruin me..." &nbsp;Love and
death
are intertwined in "Isabella; or, the Pot of Basil," "Bright Star,"
"The
Eve of St. Agnes," and "La Belle Dame sans Merci."&nbsp; The Fatal
Woman
(the woman whom it is destructive to love, like Salome, Lilith, and
Cleopatra)
appears in&nbsp; "La Belle Dame sans Merci" &nbsp;and "Lamia."<br>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Identity is an issue in his view of the
poet
and for the dreamers in his odes (e.g., "Ode to a Nightingale") and
narrative
poems. &nbsp;Of the poetic character, he says, "... it is not
itself--it
has no self--it is every thing and nothing--it has no character--it
enjoys
light and shade--it lives in gusto, be it foul or fair, high or low,
right
or poor, mean or elevated..." He calls the poet "chameleon."<br>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Harold Bloom and Lionel Trilling summarize
Keats's
world view succinctly: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote> Beyond the uncompromising sense that we are
completely physical in a physical world, and the allied realization
that we are compelled to imagine more than we can know or understand,
there is a third quality in Keats more clearly present than in any
other poet since Shakespeare. This is the gift of tragic acceptance,
which persuades us that Keats was the least solipsistic of poets, the
one most able to grasp the individuality and reality of selves totally
distinct from his own, and of an outward world that would survive his
perception of it. </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
They believe that Keats came to accept this world, the here and now, as
the ultimate value. <a name="odes"></a>
      <center><a name="odes"></a>
      <h2><a name="odes"><b>Keats's Odes</b></a></h2>
      </center>
      <a name="odes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All written in May
1819, "Ode to a Nightingale," "Ode on a Grecian Urn," and "Ode on
Melancholy" grew out of </a>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote> <a name="odes">a persistent kind of experience
which dominated Keats's feelings, attitudes, and thoughts during that
time. Each of them is a unique experience, but each of them is also, as
it were, a facet of a larger experience. This larger experience is an
intense awareness of both the joy and pain, the happiness and the
sorrow, of human life. This awareness is feeling and becomes also
thought, a kind of brooding as the poet sees them in others and feels
them in himself. This awareness is not only feeling; it becomes also
thought, a kind of brooding contemplation of the lot of human beings,
who must satisfy their desire for happiness in
a world where joy and pain are inevitably and inextricably tied
together. This union of joy and pain is the fundamental fact of human
experience that Keats has observed and accepted as true.<br>

      <p> <a name="odes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In </a><a
 href="nighting.html">"Ode to a Nightingale"</a> and <a href="urn.html">"Ode
on a Grecian Urn,"</a> Keats tries to free himself from the world of
change by identifying with the nightingale, representing nature, or the
urn, representing art. These odes, as well as <a href="psyche.html">"The
Ode to Psyche"</a> and the <a href="melancholy.html">"Ode to Melancholy</a>,"
present the poet as dreamer; the question in these odes, as well as in <a
 href="belle.html">"La Belle Dame Sans Merci"</a> and <a
 href="st_agnes.html">"The Eve of St. Agnes,"</a> is how Keats
characterizes the dream or vision. Is it a positive experience which
enriches the dreamer? or is it a negative experience which has the
potential to cut off the dreamer from the real world and destroy him?

awaken soon enough? <a name="image"></a></p>

      <center><a name="image"><b>Keats's Imagery</b></a></center>
      </h2>
      <p><a name="image">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keats's imagery
ranges among all our physical sensations: sight, hearing, taste, touch,
smell, temperature, weight, pressure, hunger, thirst, sexuality, and
movement. Keats repeatedly combines different senses in one image, that
is, he attributes the trait(s) of one sense to another, a practice
called <i>synaesthesia</i>. His synaesthetic imagery performs two
major functions in his poems: it is part of their sensual effect, and
the combining of senses normally experienced as separate suggests an
underlying unity of dissimilar happenings, the oneness of all forms of
life. Richard H. Fogle calls these images the product of his "unrivaled
ability to absorb, sympathize with, and humanize natural objects."</a></p>

Illustrations of Keats's Poems</a></div>
      </h2>
      <a name="illustrate">Keats's poems have appealed to artists and
illustrators, particularly from the 1840's through the 1930s. Three
poems have received the most attention--<i>Endymion</i>, <i>Isabella;
or, the Pot of Basil</i>, and <i>The Eve of St. Agnes</i>. According
to Richard Altick, at least twenty paintings and illustrations have
been made of each of these poems. Keats's appeal for painters and
illustrators is a tribute to how vivid and sensual his imagery is and
how his poems stimuate the imagination of his readers. There are other
reasons why painters and illustrators were drawn to him: he wrote about
art and artists and was friendly with many artists; also
the publication of his collected works in 1840 and of a biography in
1848
aroused a general interest in Keats and helped to establish his
position
as one of England's greatest poets.</a>
      <p> <a name="illustrate">As a Web project, Renzo Roblodowski
illustrated three of Keats's poems, drew Keats listening to a
nightingale in the garden of his friend Brown, and also made a drawing
of Ophelia. They are mounted as thumbnails in an art gallery on this
Website. To view his illustrations full size, click on the thumbnail or
