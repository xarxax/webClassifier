    alt="[Reviewed on CD]" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5" width="65" height="80">Massive
    prejudice alert: I am a huge John Hartford fan, have been for 30 years or more. From his
    appearances on <em>The Smothers Brothers Show</em> and <em>The Glenn Campbell Show</em> in
    the late &#145;60s and early &#145;70s to his height-of-hippie-dom release of <i>Aereo-Plain</i>
    to his mid-'70s Grammy-winning <i>Mark Twang</i>, to the times I saw him perform live in
    the 1980s and his impressive string of albums in the &#145;90s with more Grammy
    nominations, I have <em>followed</em> Hartford. In the 1970s, Hartford developed a solo
    performing style of playing fiddle or banjo while simultaneously doing a clip-clop dance
    on a sheet of plywood that had a microphone attached to it. It was mesmerizing, even on
    the few occasions he appeared on television back then. His trademark wearing of a black
    derby can be pulled off by few living human males, yet it looks perfect on Hartford. His
    love of steamboats led to a several-years-long apprenticeship on the Julia Belle Swain,
    where he eventually earned a river-pilot license. It was a dream of mine to book a
    riverboat trip when John Hartford was on board because I just know that every evening
    there would be pickin&#146; and fiddlin&#146; on the decks at sunset and in the evening.
    The opportunity has never presented itself, but I still hold out hope that I&#146;ll be
    able to do this one day.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Hartford has recorded several albums with the Hartford
    String Band. Yet this one is different -- different musicians, different style, different
    feel. Hartford seems to come up with a selection of help (ha! what an understatement!)
    that changes from album to album. There are comings and goings, but I don&#146;t think the
    same personnel lineup has appeared on any two of his &quot;String Band&quot; albums. Of
    course, Hartford is a wizard on his own. I find his collaborations with three to eight
    other musicians don&#146;t give me enough of a Hartford fix. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In spite of my expectations that <i>Good Old Boys</i> might
    not be one of my favorite Hartford albums, it has proven me wrong. This is actually a <i>great</i>
    album. Hartford and his String Band cohorts reach new heights of expression in their
    playing. They use far fewer notes than you would ever expect from a traditional bluegrass
    band, but they put so much expression and interplay into this style of playing that you
    can&#146;t help admire the effort. The 50+ minutes of music are captivating and showcase a
    slightly different side of Hartford.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The performances here completely lack flash, speed
    pickin&#146; and the tired &quot;everybody rotates playing a solo while the others noodle
    in the background&quot; format that can make traditional bluegrass boring after a while.
    No, here there is fairly continuous ensemble playing. But it varies from sparse
    punctuation for the vocals to full-tilt jams and everything in between. The playing is
    just <i>too</i> cool most of the time. With no speed contests and no one-upsmanship
    soloing, the band settles down to some of the tastiest playing together that I&#146;ve
    ever heard. You hear bluegrass influences of course. Hartford plays banjo and fiddle, and
    the String Band adds banjo (when Hartford is fiddling), guitar, mandolin and bass. Pretty
    much your standard bluegrass lineup. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">But this music transcends bluegrass. There are elements of
    folk and jazz, and best of all, every song here was written by John Hartford. Some contain
    simple thoughts briefly expressed (&quot;Dixie Trucker&#146;s Home,&quot; &quot;The Waltz
    of the Golden Rule,&quot; &quot;Owl Feather,&quot; &quot;Mike &amp; John in the
    Wilderness,&quot; &quot;Keep on Truckin&#146;&quot;). Others are longer explorations of
    particularly delightful stories, memories and deeply felt sentiments (&quot;Good Old
    Boys,&quot; &quot;On the Radio,&quot; &quot;The Cross-Eyed Child,&quot; &quot;Watching the
    River Go By,&quot; &quot;The Waltz of the Mississippi&quot;). &quot;The Cross-Eyed
    Child&quot; annoyed me the first time I heard it because it has a lot of narrative and I
    tend to not like talking mixed with music. But Hartford got to me. I now love this song.
    It is made up of anecdotes about things John Hartford has experienced or learned about the
    life of the late Bill Monroe, perhaps the legitimate father of bluegrass music. Monroe
    grew up being a &quot;cross-eyed child,&quot; as Hartford learned from Monroe&#146;s
    friends and family. Hartford is a hypnotic storyteller, and he can do it while speaking or
    singing -- both are used to great effect in the 10+ minutes of &quot;The Cross-Eyed
    Child.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A word of warning for those who are annoyed by
    less-than-perfect vocal performances: John Hartford&#146;s voice is not what you could
    consider commercially flawless. Sometimes he quavers, wavers or croaks. His raspy baritone
    is not Harry Belafonte smooth, but he&#146;s not as vocally challenged as Lou Reed or Tom
    Waits. Personally, I find his voice <i>perfect</i> for him. He doesn&#146;t need to sing
    better technically -- in fact, if he did, his music would lose a considerable amount of
    charm and naturalness. The effect is human, real and invitingly comfortable. When he
    sings, he sounds exactly as you would imagine -- just a regular guy singing about boyhood
    memories, riverboat dreams, friendship, a girl at a dance, or a special teacher.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The sound of this recording sets a new high for the Rounder
    label based on what I&#146;ve heard in the past. For many years back into the &#145;80s
    and even &#145;70s, I&#146;d always found Rounder&#146;s CDs and LPs to be kind of
    compressed and gray-sounding. The music was always wonderful, but the sound was lackluster
    -- not <i>bad</i>, but I knew that it could have been a lot better. Well, on this CD the
    sound <i>is</i> a lot better. It&#146;s right up there with other good-sounding CDs as
    released by most record labels these days. There isn&#146;t a lot of soundstage depth and
    the performers are all right up front, as if you were sitting no more than a few feet from
    them. There is a good spread to the sound, the transparency is pretty good and all the
    instruments are well presented, including the bass, which is neither obtrusive or
    inaudible, just as it should be. I was surprised when the HDCD light lit up on the Sonic
    Frontiers DAC 2.6 Signature since there was nothing on the outside of the CD indicating
    that it was an HDCD recording. Upon checking out the CD booklet, I found there was mention
    made that the CD was mastered using the HDCD process.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">While I&#146;m now officially nuts about <em>Good Old Boys</em>,
    this album alone doesn&#146;t really give you a picture of John Hartford the artist since
    it is a bit of a departure from his solo performing and even different from other group
    performances. To get a more complete overview of Hartford and his work, try <i>Anthology:
    Me Oh My How the Time Does Fly</i> (selections from the Flying Fish Albums, CD reissued by
    Rounder)<i>, Mark Twang</i> (Flying Fish, CD reissued by Rounder)<i>, Headin&#146; Down
    Into the Mystery Below</i> (Flying Fish, out of print; note to Rounder: please reissue!)<i>,
    Aereo-Plain</i> (Warner Bros, CD reissued by Rounder)<i>, Gum Tree Canoe </i>(Flying Fish
    / Rounder cassette only now), and <i>Down On the River</i> (Flying Fish, CD reissued by
    Rounder). You can find out more about John Hartford at <a
