<i>[In the Year of Our Lady of Discord 3183 yr. ded. ed. received a message via Ye Olde Internytte informing us that we would be faced with legal action if we left the text of the story up any longer, and thus, despite the fact that Borges wrote the story in 1941 and has been dead for almost 32 years, we have removed the story to make sure we don't negatively impact his earning potential.  If you have a free lawyer in your pocket...let him out, poor guy.]</i>
