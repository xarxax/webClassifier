For many years, the late Henry Miller was considered the &quot;Bad Boy&quot; of American 
literature. His novel, <i>The Tropic of Cancer</i>, first
    published in France, dealt with the ribald exploits of
    expatriate writers in Paris during the 1930s. For over twenty
    years, the book was banned in the USA. Elmer Gertz
    successfully defended the book's publication in Illinois.
    After the ban was lifted, Gertz and Miller became friends--a
    friendship that was reflected in a collection of their letters: <em>Henry Miller: Years of Trial and Triumph (1962-1964)</em>, Southern Illinois Press, 1978. This intervew was posted on American Legends in February 1998. Elmer Gertz died in 2000 at age 93. American Legends also interviewed Gertz about his long friendship with Harry Truman. </font></font><font lang="0" face="Times New Roman" size="3" FAMILY="SERIF"><br>

    admired Isaac Bashevis Singer more than any other American writer, and they 
    were close friends. Even when he was a very poor man, Miller was not a 
    proletarian. He disliked all political and social labels.</font></p>
