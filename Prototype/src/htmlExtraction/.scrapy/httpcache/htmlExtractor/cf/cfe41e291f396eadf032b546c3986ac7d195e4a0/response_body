<!--PLEASE PLANT THIS BOOK RICHARD BRAUTIGAN... Richard Brautigan published Please Plant This Book in the Spring of 1968. It consisted of eight packets of seeds, each printed with a poem, all gathered in a small folder. That's Richard's daughter Ianthe on the front. Here is a digital version of Please Plant This Book, typographical errors and all. Seeds not included... 2003 Andrew Stafford... Lettuce: The only hope we have is our children and the seeds we give them and the gardens we plan together... California Native Flowers: In this spring of 1968 with the last third of the Twentieth Century travelling like a dream toward its end, it is time to plant books to pass them into the ground, so that flowers and vegetables may grow from these pages... Carrots: I think the spring of 1968 is a good time to look into our blood and see where our hearts are flowing as these flowers and vegetables will look into their hearts evrey day and see the sun reflecting like a great mirror their desire to live and be beautiful... Calendula: My friends worry and they tell me about it. They talk of the world ending of darkness and disaster. I always listen gently and then say: No, it's not going to end. This is only the beginning, as this book is only a beginning... Parsley: I thank the energy, the gods and the theater of history that brought us here to this very moment with this book in our hands, calling like the future down a green and starry hall... Squash: The time is right to mix sentences sentences with dirt and the sun with punctuation and the rain with verbs, and for worms to pass through question marks and the stars to shine down on budding nouns, and the dew to form on paragraphs... Sweet Alyssum Royal Carpet: I've decided to live in a world where books are changed into thousands of gardens with children playing in the gardens and learning the gentle ways of green growing things... Shasta Daisy: I pray that in thirty-two years passing that flowers and vegetables will water the Twenty-First Century with thir voices telling that they were once a book turned by loving hands into life. -->
