THERE'S  a pasture in a valley where the hanging woods divide,<br>
And a Herd lies down and ruminates in peace;<br>
Where the pheasant rules the nooning, and the owl the twilight tide,<br>
And the war-cries of our world die out and cease.<br>
Here I cast aside the burden that each weary week-day brings <br>
And, delivered from the shadows I pursue, <br>
On peaceful, postless, Sabbaths I consider Weighty Things <br>
Such as Sussex Cattle feeding in the dew! <br> <br>

At the gate beside the river where the trouty shallows brawl, <br>
I know the pride that Lobengula felt, <br>
When he bade the bars be lowered of the Royal Cattle Kraal, <br>
And fifteen miles of oxen took the veldt. <br>
From the walls of Bulawayo in unbroken file they came <br>
To where the Mount of Council cuts the blue . . . <br>
I have only six and twenty, but the principle's the same <br>
With my Sussex Cattle feeding in the dew! <br> <br>

To a luscious sound of tearing, where the clovered herbage rips, <br>
Level-backed and level-bellied watch 'em move. <br>
See those shoulders, guess that heart-girth, praise those loins, admire those hips, <br>

And the tail set low for flesh to make above! <br>
Count the broad unblemished muzzles, test the kindly mellow skin <br>
And, where yon heifer lifts her head at call, <br>
Mark the bosom's just abundance 'neath the gay and cleancut chin, <br>
And those eyes of Juno, overlooking all! <br> <br>

Here is colour, form and substance, I will put it to the proof <br>
And, next season, in my lodges shall be born <br>
Some very Bull of Mithras, flawless from his agate hoof <br>
To his even-branching ivory, dusk-tipped horn. <br>
He shall mate with block-square virgins - kings shall seek his like in vain, <br>
While I multiply his stock a thousandfold, <br>
Till an hungry world extol me, builder of a lofty strain <br>
That turns one standard ton at two years old. <br> <br>

<I>There's a valley, under oakwood, where a man may dream his dream,<br>
In the milky breath of cattle laid at ease, <br>
Till the moon o'ertops the alders, and her image chills the stream,<br>
And the river-mist runs silver round their knees! <br>
Now the footpaths fade and vanish; now the ferny clumps  deceive; <br>
Now the hedgerow-folk possess their fields anew; <br>
Now the Herd is lost in darkness, and I bless them as I leave, <br>
My Sussex Cattle feeding in the dew! </I><br> <br>
