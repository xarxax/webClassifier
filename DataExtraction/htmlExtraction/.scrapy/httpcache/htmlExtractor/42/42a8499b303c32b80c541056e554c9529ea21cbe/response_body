<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font size="4">Genre: sacred lyric collection imitating the
architectural structure of a church while tracing the story of the persona's struggle with
faith. </font></b>&nbsp; <b><font size="4">
<a href="four_ways_to_read_herbert.html">All in all, there are 
probably more ways to read Herbert than are possible for any other poet in 
English literature.</a>&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Form: extraordinary metrical experiments, including &quot;shaped
poems,&quot; the most famous of which are &quot;The Altar&quot; and &quot;Easter
Wings.&quot;&nbsp; The book as a whole also has the form of a spiritual autobiography in
lyrics, sacralizing the sonnet cycle's obsessive narration of the Lover-Beloved
relationship and redirecting its interest in philosophy to the limitations of
will-directed reason and the power of faith to command the believer. </font> </p>

<p><font size="4">Characters:</font></b><font size="4"> Herbert's persona is almost indistinguishable from his historical one,
except that some of these poetic situations clearly are fanciful, and the personae of
&quot;Love,&quot; &quot;God,&quot; &quot;heart,&quot; arise from the medieval allegorical
tradition but transcend it by means of Herbert's dexterous and surprising ability to make
them psychological forces as well as metaphysical phenomena. </font> </p>

<p><b><font size="4">Summary:</font></b><font size="4"> Herbert's struggle tends to reflect his personal ambitions for a
worldly life which were set against the demands of his rural parsonage at
Bemerton.&nbsp;
His ambition raised him from the fifth son of a dead Welch father to a member of
Parliament and of the faculty of Cambridge.&nbsp; But the death of patrons led him to
reconsider his objectives, and his last 3 years he lived as a poor country parson and
wrote all the poems in <u>The Temple</u>. &nbsp; If you are strapped for time and need to
read for the core of the assignment, I can suggest no better than &quot;Jordan 1,&quot;
&quot;Denial,&quot; &quot;Easter Wings,&quot; &quot;The Collar,&quot; and &quot;Love
3.&quot;&nbsp; See the note to &quot;Jordan 1&quot; to understand<a href="George_Herbert_Sin_1.htm"> the numbers
following some titles</a>--they're important to an appreciation of the enormous
&quot;foreconceit&quot; (as Sidney would have put it) which Herbert brought to the
creation of the whole collection. </font> </p>

<p><font size="4">Some poems and brief notes on issues: 

</font> 

<ul>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;The Altar&quot;</font></b><font size="4">--note it is a &quot;broken Altar&quot; that the poem
    describes--can you see divisions in the lines?&nbsp; Readers in the next century (Dryden
    and Johnson, especially) attacked poems like Herbert's for wrenching the form of language
    to make it more extraordinary than its message.</font><ul>
      <li><font size="4">Can this poem be defended as aesthetically appropriate to its content? 
		</font> </li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="4">The poem occurs near the beginning of the cycle that makes up <u>The Temple</u>. 
	</font> <ul>
      <li><font size="4">Under what circumstances would a temple's altar be encountered first?</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;Redemption&quot;</font></b><font size="4"> has clear links to Everyman's discovery that he was only a
    vassal of God, not an independent land-owner farming his body.&nbsp; How does this sonnet
    use the Crucifixion as a context for the tennant's demand for a new lease?&nbsp; (This
    also relates to the &quot;Parable of the Vineyard.&quot;) </font> </li>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;Easter&quot;</font></b><font size="4"> replays the lute song we encountered in Wyatt (see &quot;My
    Lute Awake,&quot; 530-1) with a holy text.&nbsp; It also sets up the &quot;broken
    string&quot; rhymes of &quot;Denial&quot;'s outrageous parody of the traditional lute
    song. </font> </li>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;Easter Wings&quot;</font></b><font size="4"> contains two paired stanzas, currently printed by the
    Norton above one another.&nbsp; What would it do to your sense of the poem to place them
    side by side?&nbsp; Consider them, for instance, on opposing pages of an open book.
    &nbsp;&nbsp; To see the Luminarium page containing an image of Herbert's manuscript of the
    poem's first stanza, click
  <a href="http://www.luminarium.org/sevenlit/herbert/ewings.jpg">here</a>.
    &nbsp; Compare it with the UbuWeb Visual Poetry page containing an image of <a
    href="http://www.ubu.com/historical/early/early12.jpg">the first edition's printed version</a>,
    which you will note <u> also</u> differs from the way the Norton prints it.&nbsp;
    Based on Herbert's manuscript page, how do you think he wanted the poem to
    be set in print?&nbsp; (Note that he sent his poetic manuscripts to a friend
    and died before they were printed.)&nbsp; If you are
    interested in exploring more early shaped poems, go to UbuWeb's &quot;Historical&quot;
    section and scroll down to &quot;Early Visual Poetry: 1506-1726.&quot;</font></li>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;Affliction 1&quot;</font></b><font size="4"> may refer to the tuberculosis from which Herbert died,
    as well as his own struggles to remain true to his faith when the pains of his illness
    wracked his body.&nbsp; Notice the images we had seen in Donne's Holy Sonnets,
    especially
    in lines 37ff.&nbsp; Herbert also makes use of a strategy of forgetfulness in the last
    lines, a ploy we have seen before in Chaucer's &quot;Wife of Bath's Prologue.&quot;</font><ul>
      <li><font size="4">How does it reshape the flow of the poem?</font></li>
    </ul>
	<p><font size="4">&quot;Affliction 1&quot; is so named because it is one of a sequence of
    &quot;Affliction&quot; poems that may be read together in a sequence which evolves the
    poet's response to the topic.&nbsp; You will see similar numerical indicators in the
    sequences about &quot;Prayer,&quot; &quot;Jordan,&quot; and &quot;Love.&quot;&nbsp; Of the
    three, the Norton editors only give you one comparison (&quot;Jordan&quot; 1 and 2) but
    it's a good example. </font> </p>
  </li>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;Prayer 1&quot;</font></b><font size="4"> is an extended series of metaphors which build an
    increasingly audacious set of comparisons, impelled by a rapid rhythm.&nbsp;&nbsp; One
    might chart the rise and fall of the metaphors, or their violence vs. softness. 
	</font> </li>
  <li><b><a href="George_Herbert_Jordan_I.htm"><font size="4">&quot;Jordan 1&quot;</font></a></b><font size="4"> contains the most famous rejection of courtly versifying in
    English literature, though one Mary Herbert (no relation) brought out in the
    speech of
    &quot;Piers&quot; in the &quot;Dialogue.&quot;&nbsp; This is not a sentiment without other
    precedent in English poetic tradition, however.&nbsp; Anti-Petrarchanism in 
  Sidney's <i>Astrophil and Stella </i>take a similar stance with respect to 
	well-established poetic conventions for describing beauty, poetic 
	inspiration, etc.&nbsp; Also compare Shakespeare's &quot;Shall I compare thee to 
	a summer's day?&quot; and &quot;My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun,&quot; for their 
	use of plain diction and the meter of ordinary speech to contrast with the 
	ornamented speech of other poets.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Herbert's intentions 
	are considerable different from Shakespeare's, or Sidney's, except for the 
	psalm translations Sidney produced with his sister Mary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	</font> <ul>
      <li><font size="4">What does this poem's strategies tell you about Herbert's aesthetic and the problem of poetic ornament?&nbsp; 
      How would you compare it with Marvell's later, similar meditation on the 
      problem of writing religious verse, </font> <a href="Marvell_coronet.htm">
		<font size="4">&quot;The 
      Coronet&quot;?</font></a></li>
      <li><a href="Herbert_Synchronic_jordan_i_and_jordan_ii.htm">
		<font size="4">Its title 
      bears a number which indicates Herbert meant it to be read in the context 
      of &quot;Jordan 2,&quot;</font></a><font size="4"> a second poem on the same subject, how to write about 
      sacred subjects using secular poetic techniques.&nbsp; Its title also 
      alludes to the river the Jews had to cross in order to enter the Promised 
      Land of Israel.&nbsp; Why would the poem be like that river?</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;Church Monuments&quot;</font></b><font size="4"> may readily be compared with Donne regarding the
    body as the soul's container, shell, cover, etc. </font> </li>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;The Windows&quot;</font></b><font size="4"> contrasts two kinds of preaching, one which sounds in the
    ear and the other which sounds in the conscience.&nbsp; What kinds of windows does Herbert
    refer to when he describes &quot;This glorious and transcendent place&quot; (4)? 
	</font> </li>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;Denial&quot;</font></b><font size="4"> has another wonderfully faulty rhyme scheme.&nbsp; See why I
    made you pay attention to it before?&nbsp; If you had never noticed the trouble poets took
    to rhyme, you'd never appreciate Herbert's studied resistance to rhyme in the narrative of
    his disorderly mind's rebellion, until God remedies the defect in the last couplet. 
	</font> </li>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;Virtue&quot;</font></b><font size="4"> turns on the fourth's stanza's reversal of the previous three
    stanzas' terminal refrain. &nbsp; Dying and living are, for Herbert, not merely physical
    events. </font> </li>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;Man&quot;</font></b><font size="4"> returns to the man-microcosm theme to describe the human frame as
    &quot;God's house,&quot; a position that might be compared with Marvell's
    &quot;garden&quot; poems. </font> </li>
  <li><a href="Herbert_Jordan_ii.htm"><b><font size="4">&quot;Jordan 2&quot;</font></b><font size="4">
	</font> </a><font size="4">strongly resembles Sidney's first sonnet in <u>Astrophil and
    Stella</u>, both in its strategy and in its resolution of the problem it describes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <a href="Herbert_Synchronic_jordan_i_and_jordan_ii.htm">Its title indicates 
  Herbert intended it to be read in the context of &quot;Jordan 1,&quot;</a> which 
  addresses the same problem, how to write about sacred subjects using secular 
  poetic techniques. </font> </li>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;Time&quot;</font></b><font size="4"> remarkably anticipates Marvell's &quot;mower&quot; poems in the
    view of Death the Mower, and reflects a view similar to Mephistophilis' of the paradoxical
    nature of time without access to the divine. </font> </li>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;The Bunch of Grapes&quot;</font></b><font size="4"> takes up Christianity's &quot;Old Law vs. New
    Law&quot; explanation of its relationship to Jewish tradition and makes of the &quot;New
    Law&quot; a &quot;wine&quot; pressed from the Law at the Crucifixion.</font><ul>
      <li><font size="4">Who would the &quot;grapevine&quot; be and with what divinity does that associate him?</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;The Pilgrimage&quot;</font></b><font size="4"> follows the long line of Christian poetry viewing life
    as a pilgrimage, which we first encountered in Chaucer and which might be considered an
    answer to the &quot;Wanderer&quot;'s use of the <i>ubi sunt</i> theme.&nbsp; Note that it
    develops as an allegory in which the landscape relates to spiritual states. 
	</font> </li>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;The Holdfast&quot; </font> </b><font size="4">returns in a theoretical way to the puzzle
    of our existence in a borrowed form, on loan from God, and to the
    constraints that places on the recipient's capacity to express thanks.&nbsp;
    Remember that we're emerging from feudal world views about the naturalness
    of lord-vassal relationships, with their presumed dependencies and
    celebrated hierarchies.&nbsp; The emergence of an egalitarian,
    proto-democratic culture sets up some serious challenges to those &quot;in
    debt.&quot;&nbsp; How can you repay a loan with borrowed money?&nbsp; This
    attempts to resolve the paradox--but who's the &quot;friend&quot;? </font> </li>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;The Collar&quot;</font></b><font size="4"> resembles Donne's Holy Sonnets in its use of violent verse
    to depict violent spiritual crises.&nbsp; Its rhyme (see &quot;Denial&quot;) is slightly
    off, a kind of mockery of rhyme that challenges the &quot;free&quot; poet's rebellion
    while he rants about what he's going to accomplish when he abandons religious verse.&nbsp;
    This stumbling meter drops irregularly into dimeters until the final four lines bring true
    rhyme in the sudden dialogue between a hithertofor ignored persona (i.e., &quot;My
    Lord&quot;) who has been overhearing the poem we've been considering ourselves the sole
    audience for.</font><ul>
      <li><font size="4">What does this do to us, as well as to the speaker?</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;The Pulley&quot;</font></b><font size="4"> condenses much of the argument of <u>Everyman's</u> final
    sequence into three stanzas in an argument about the purpose of labor and suffering in
    human life. </font> </li>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;The Flower&quot;</font></b><font size="4"> seems intimately related to Marvell's view of the natural
    Garden as God's creation (vs. the human-created one) and the danger of relying on
    artificial technique. </font> </li>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;The Forerunners&quot;</font></b><font size="4"> follows the &quot;Jordan&quot; poems in its satire on
    the love poetry of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. </font> </li>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;Discipline&quot;</font></b><font size="4"> resembles a courtier's plea to an angry lord, which is, of
    course, what it is, but it also uses the &quot;Cupid's bow&quot; motif, which we saw in
    Surrey's &quot;The Long Love,&quot; but shifts it to a dread of the power of divine love. 
	</font> </li>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;Death&quot;</font></b><font size="4"> plays the same game with the dreaded messenger of <u>Everyman</u>
    that we see in Donne's Holy Sonnet #10. </font> </li>
  <li><b><font size="4">&quot;Love 3&quot;</font></b><font size="4"> takes place in the context of the Christian Eucharist
    or love
    feast which has its most famous example in the Last Supper but which occurs in every
    sacrament of communion. &nbsp; &quot;Love,&quot; the persona in which Herbert invokes God,
    plays the seducer of the bashful Herbert, and Love-the-host utters gentle commands similar
    to those we heard in &quot;The Collar&quot; and &quot;Jordan 2.&quot;&nbsp; One also might
    compare Julian of Norwich's description of her visionary God's &quot;homely&quot; behavior
    (359-60). </font> <ul>
      <li><font size="4">How might Julian's use of this word explain something important about Herbert and about
        English ideas of the proper behavior of the mighty?</font></li>

<p><b><font size="4">Issues and Research Sources: </font> </b>

<ol>
  <li><font size="4">Herbert's anguished drama of faith can seem alienating to some modern readers who prefer
    to consider modern popular agnosticism or atheism as the result of our
    &quot;progress&quot; in overcoming ancient superstitions.&nbsp; Others dislike witnessing
    a man's innermost religious agonies, preferring (oddly) to listen to the erotic or
    political disorders of other poets. &nbsp; Herbert's work went through 13 editions between
    the first in 1633 and 1679, a total of over 20,000 copies (small for a
    modern press run but enormous for this era!). </font> <ul>
      <li><font size="4">What does this tell us about the poems' insight into the hearts and mind of readers in
        the mid-seventeenth century, and what does the nearly complete extinction of interest of
        Herbert in the next century (1709-1799) tell us about the ensuing shift in cultural interests?</font></li>
      <li><font size="4">Why does Herbert's work become more popular in the 19th century than
        he was in the 17th (based on number of editions)?&nbsp; Think about that
        when you reach the Victorian era in English 212.&nbsp; To consult the
        published editions of <i>The Temple</i>, use the Library's
        &quot;Electronic Resources&quot; list and pick &quot;WorldCat.&quot;&nbsp;
        Search for &quot;Herbert, George&quot; as author and &quot;The
        Temple&quot; as title--you'll get a few weird hits for an Egyptology
        text, but all the others are individual printings (c. 150) of Herbert's 
		</font> <i><font size="4">The
        Temple.</font></i></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font size="4">The typography and mise-en-page (layout of the lines on the page) of poetry can be a
    powerfully expressive tool for the artist.&nbsp; Modern printed editions, laboring under
    the burdens of high reproduction costs and somewhat limited appreciations of the poet's
    graphical sophistication often reduce the poems to the most economical form for
    reproduction, a strategy which might violate a key aspect of the author's intentions.</font><ul>
      <li><font size="4">What might you find were you to look at the volume of Herbert's work as it was first
        printed in 1633?</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="4">Since Herbert did not live to see his work through the printing process, but rather
    consigned this task to a friend in London, it also is possible that even the first printed
    edition might not reflect his actual intentions.</font><ul>
      <li><font size="4">From what kind of source might we recover his actual intentions, and does such a source
        exist for Herbert's <u>The Temple</u>?</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font size="4">Herbert's lyrics can be profitably compared with those of John Donne, 
	whose collected poems were also posthumously published in 1633, the same 
	year as the first print edition of <i>The Temple</i>.&nbsp;
	</font>
	<strong style="font-weight: 400"><font size="4">When we compare John Donne's lyrics with 
	George Herbert's, you should be struck by how amazingly different their 
	diction is from the poems of their contemporaries, like Jonson's or 
	Herrick's.&nbsp; Particularly in poems like &quot;To the Sun Rising&quot; and 
	&quot;Canonization,&quot; by Donne, and &quot;Redemption,&quot; the two &quot;Jordan&quot; poems and &quot;The 
	Collar,&quot; by Herbert, you suddenly hear the ordinary spoken Early Modern 
	English of the street in a poem about erotic love and love of God.&nbsp; The 
	rhythms also are spectacularly vernacular, which produces some of the exotic 
	variations in line length and meter we see in the poem's shape on the page.&nbsp; 
	&quot;The Modern is coming!,&quot; both poets proclaim, though in other ways their 
	verses still hark back to Medieval values.&nbsp; If you think about the 
	</font> <a href="mannerist_and_baroque_style--Masks%20and%20Selves.htm">
	<font size="4">poems as 
verbal &quot;dances,&quot; moving on their verbal &quot;feet&quot; (iambs, trochees, etc.) in sudden 
thrusts and spins, you also can get a feel for what will become known in later 
generations as &quot;Mannerist&quot; style, a precursor to Milton's (and Bach's) &quot;Baroque&quot; 
super-plenitude.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font> </a></strong></li>
	<li><font size="4">Herbert's religious lyrics also often are compared with those by Richard 
  Crashaw.&nbsp; If you are interested in specializing in lyric poets, you might 
  want to read a few of Crashaw's poems in order to have some way of putting 
  Herbert's work in context.&nbsp; Though they both write lyrics about Christian 
  themes, their verse is strikingly different.&nbsp; To see a Crashaw study
