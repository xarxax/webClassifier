Welcome to my Anti-Nakago page, also known as Katsu's utter fount of immaturity. I really can be mature, sometimes, I swear. Now that I've gotten that out of the way...
<P>
Let me state it right here, in bright letters: <font color="Yellow">I DESPISE NAKAGO!</font> He's evil. He makes my skin crawl. Every time I see him, I feel the urge to run into the bathroom and take a shower and scrub my skin bloody. Nakago is one of the two characters in the history of anime (the other being Ikari Gendo) that I cannot feel any empathy for. He's just that horrible. I've watched all of Fushigi Yuugi...though I have never had access to the manga...so I've seen him to the bitter end.
<P>
Just a quick note: If you disagree with me, sign the guest book! I really want to show the other side, because it's not really fair unless I do.
<P>
WARNING: Opinions expressed by anyone other than me in either the guestbook or the e-mail response pages are the opinions of their writers alone, and in no way reflect the thoughts of the author of this page. I do not believe in censorship, so no e-mails are cut short (except for a few that have strictly personal notes, which I do cut out), or edited for bad language and content. If anyone is offended by anything that appears in the opinions page, let me give one piece of advice before you get too upset: Consider the source. That goes for me, too. Thank you.<br>
<P>
And now, without further ado, on with the show.

I've gotten a lot of signatures in the guestbook expressing the opinion that I should leave poor Nakkie-poo alone. Unfortunately, that's the one request I can't cater to. Why? Because...I LOVE POKING AT HIM! O ho ho ho ho!
