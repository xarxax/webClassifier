<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The author Walter Mosley was born in 1952 Los
Angeles, California. He attended Goddard College and Johnson State
College, and has been a computer programmer. He is currently a
professor of English at New York University.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Walter Mosley's mystery novels have often been
compared to those of Raymond Chandler, mainly because they share
vivid settings on the seamy side of Los Angeles in the middle
decades of the century, a less-than-rosy view of human nature,
and tough but noble main characters in Philip Marlowe and <A 
HREF="easy_rawlins.html">Ezekiel Rawlins</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">There's another similarity: like Chandler,
Mosley wields elegant, economical prose to create unforgettable
characters. Chief among them is series protagonist Easy Rawlins.
In many ways Rawlins is a kind of black Everyman, reflecting the
great migration from the South in mid-century. He grew up in Houston,
fought in World War II and works hard for a better life in Los
Angeles, keenly aware of the boundaries imposed upon him by racism.
But Easy is no stereotype; endlessly complex, he continues to
surprise and reward readers. Chandler once wrote that the best
mysteries are those you would read even if the last chapter were
torn out; Easy Rawlins is a character who would make you do just
that. Rawlins is not a private eye; he makes his living at everything
from real estate to janitorial work. He's a sometime fixer, drawn
into mysteries, often against his will, because some friend or
connection needs his help.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Like many other Black detective/mystery authors
(witness <A HREF="http://www.math.buffalo.edu/~sww/HIMES/CHESTER.html">Chester
Himes</A>), Mosley novels use the side-kick accessory to blunt
the dark side of the protagonist's character. Beginning in the
early 1940s, the Ezekiel &quot;Easy&quot; Rawlins novels use this
most effectively with Easy and his sometimey buddy, Mouse. In
the course of five novels, he's lost a wife and daughter and gained
a couple of adopted children, made tidy sums of money and lost
them, drunk a lot of whisky and given it up, fought despair and
anger and, provisionally at least, won. The sixth published novel
is the first Mosley wrote, the first in the series, the first
not set in the Watts section of LA, though it is strenghtened
by reading it after the first published.</FONT></P>

<P><A HREF="#read mo'"><FONT SIZE="+1">Devil In A Blue Dress</FONT></A><FONT
 SIZE="+1"> (1990), published to critical acclaim and nominated
for an Edgar, established him as a mystery writer of the first
rank. When President Bill Clinton cited Mosley as one of his favorite
writers in 1992, it brought Mosley even wider media attention
- making the remainder of the first three, A <A HREF="#read mo'">Red
Death</A> (1991) and <A HREF="#read mo'">White Butterfly</A> (1992),
very popular. <A HREF="#read mo'">Black Betty</A> (1964) made
the New York Times best-seller list, and the <A HREF="#other books">1995
movie version</A> of Devil in a Blue Dress, starring Denzel Washington
as Easy, was well-reviewed, although it was, for some perverse
reason, a box office washout. His fifth, <A HREF="#read mo'">A
Yellow Little Dog</A> (1996) made the New York Times best-seller
list too. With his sixth Easy Rawlins novel, <A HREF="#read mo'">Gone
Fishin'</A> (1997), Mosley chose an African American publisher,
<A HREF="http://www.blackclassic.com/">Black Classic Press</A>
instead of his usual W.W.Norton. A seventh Easy Rawlins novel,
<A HREF="#read mo'">Bad Boy Bobby Brown</A>, is due in 1998 or
1999.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Mosley's non-&quot;Easy&quot; books are quite
good. <A HREF="#other books">RL's Dream</A>, based in part on
the life of blues legend Robert (Leroy) Johnson. <A HREF="#other books">Always
Outnumbered, Always Outgunned</A> (1997) suggests a new introspective
detective series with its remarkable protagonist Socrates Fortlow.
<A HREF="#other books">HBO created a movie</A> out of it starring
Laurence Fishburn as Fortlow. His first science fiction novel,
<A HREF="#other books">Blue Light</A>, is Walter Moseley's current
release and the prelude to a trilogy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">I was introduced to Walter Mosley's books during
the early 90s nearly simultaneously by my wife, a mystery writer
friend, and President William Clinton. In all of his six (soon
to be seven) &quot;Easy&quot; novels, Mosley uses period detail
and slang to create authentic settings and characters, especially
the earnest, complex Rawlins, who continually is faced with personal,
social, and moral dilemmas. They are fast page turners laced with
drugs, desire and death. Inside and outside the genre, Walter
Mosley is an American writer of our times.</FONT></P>
