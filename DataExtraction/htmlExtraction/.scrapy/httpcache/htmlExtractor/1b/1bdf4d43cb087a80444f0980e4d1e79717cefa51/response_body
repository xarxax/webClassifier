This annotated bibliography list, a subset derived from the Adherents.com Religion in Literature database, is intended as a resource for <strong>literary</strong> research. It lists mainstream science fiction novels or short stories which contain references to Philip K. Dick. It is not necessarily a comprehensive list of such literature, but all Hugo-, Campbell-, Nebula- and Locus-winning novels <em>have</em> been indexed, as have many other major works.
<p>
Philip K. Dick is one of the most enigmatic and distinctive writers in the history of science fiction. His personal life was in many ways as unusual as his fiction. Fans and other writers have enjoyed PKD's numerous novels and short stories, which were always unique but at the same time hit upon a number of "Dickian" themes. PKD frequently wrote about the very nature of reality, and about how we know what we know. Spiritual, religious and philosophical themes were prominent. He considered advances in technology not in the optimistic or pessimistic modes typical of other genre writers, but as commonplace components of a shockingly commonplace existence. Dick's worlds managed to be more bizarre than those of other writers, while at the same time exuding a greasy, lived-in, almost mundane reality.
<p>
Even years after his death in 1982, Philip K. Dick remains one of the world's best known science fiction writers, due in part to the success of a number of movies based on his stories and books. Adaptation of PKD's fiction include "Blade Runner" (1982, directed by Ridley Scott, directed by Paul Verhoeven, starring Harrison Ford), "Total Recall" (1990, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger), "Minority Report" (2002, starring Tom Cruse, directed by Steven Spielberg, produced by Jerry Molen) and "Paycheck" (2003, directed by John Woo, starring Ben Affleck and Aaron Eckhart).
<p>
PKD was a "science fiction writer's writer." Many of the genre's pros have cited him as an important influence. Some have even referred to him within the their own fiction. Such references are listed on this page.
<p>
Michael Bishop even wrote an entire novel inspired by and dedicated to PKD (<em>The Secret Ascension; or, Philip K. Dick is Dead, Alas</em>), a sort of Dickian pastiche that includes PKD in the title and as a character. Kingsley Amis' award-winning novel <em>The Alteration</em> is an alternate history which contains a lengthy passage in which characters discuss PKD's novel <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>, which is itself an award-winning alternative history. (<em>The Alteration</em> won the Campbell and <em>Castle</em> won the Hugo.) Douglas A. Mackey's novel <em>Weird Scenes: Inside the Godmind</em> (2001, Qubik Books) features a prominent character named Clarence Clapper who, according to the author, is a thinly disguised version of Philip K. Dick.
<p>
Philip K. Dick also wrote recursive science fiction, that is science fiction <em>about</em> the science fiction genre and its writers. Some of his recursive science fiction includes references to himself. His novel <em>Valis</em> is probably his most autobiographical work. Both <em>Valis</em> and <em>Radio Free Albemuth</em> features himself (a science fiction writer named Phil Dick) as a major character.

Got all that? Pg. 21-22:<blockquote>In the same theatrical spirit as Decuman, Thomas looked warily over at the door, then produced from his bedding a small, battered, coverless book, which he held in the air like a trophy.<p>"How did you come by it?"<p>"Ned, the brewer's boy. Of course he can't read, so he must act as a go-between, but he refuses to say where his goods come from."<p>..."So. How much did you pay?"<p>"Sixpence."<p>"By Saint George's sacred balls! We expect something hot for that."<p>"We have it--this is as hot as sh--."<p>"Read us some," said Hubert.<p>"Think what you do," said Mark.<p>"Decumen slowly clenched his fist at Mark. "You may remain as you are and listen, or may lie and pretend to sleep and listen, but listen you will. Read, Tom."<p>"I think it would be best if I told you the first part in short. It's not very easy and I had to go slow."<p>"Very well," said Decuman. "First let us know what it's called."<p>"<em>The Man in the High Castle</em>, by Philip K. Dick."<p>"A strange name. It is TR [Time Romance, i.e., science fiction], I suppose?"<p>"If you count CW [Counterfeit World, i.e., alternative history] as TR."<p>"CW, is it? Yes, indeed I do. Say, then."<p>"The story starts in this year, nineteen seventy-six, but a great many things are different."<p>"Are they so? We all know what CW is. Get on. What things?"<p>"I'll tell you if you stop interrupting. Invention has been set free a long time before. Sickness is almost conquered: nobody dies of consumption or the plague. The deserts have been made fertile. The inventors are actually called scientists, and they use electricity."<p>"Such profaneness," said Mark, listening with close attention.
<p>"They send messages all over the Earth with it [electricity]. They use it to light whole cities and even to keep folk warm. There are electric flying-machines that move at two hundred miles an hour."<p>"Flying-machines always appear--this is no more than ordinary TR [s.f.]," growled Decuman. "You said it was CW [alt. history]."<p>TR, or Time Romance, was a type of fiction that appealed to a type of mind. It had readers among schoolboys, colegiates, mechanics, inventors, scribes, merchantmen, members of Convocatio and even, it was whispered, those in holy orders. Though it was formally illegal, the authorities were wise enough to know that to suppress it altogether a disproportionate effort would be necessary, and contended themselves with occasional raids and confiscations.</blockquote>[More.]</td>

We have a report of a story titled "Dr Adder," written by K.W. Jeter, which features a post-apocalyptic pirate radio station named "KCID" operated by a character who is an homage to Philip K. Dick. We will post more information and confirmation after we track down this story and check it out.

In K.W. Jeter's "Dr Adder", there is a pirate radio station in a post-apocalypse L.S. named "KCID", operated by a very PKDean gentleman.
