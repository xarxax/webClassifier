                <P class='content'><Span class='content_label'>Metalworking Machinery: </span> We've 
                been dealing in used and reconditioned metalworking machinery since 1981, beginning in 
                Tennessee and later moving to Florida in 2001. We've had the privilege of providing 
                machinery to manufacturers of all sizes in All Fifty States and Canada. Though we 
                specialize in the above eight types of metalworking machinery, we do also provide many 
                other types of metalworking machinery. We've sold cnc machining centers, drills, key 
                seaters, lathes, millers, jig grinders, plate bending rolls, saws, straightening 
                presses. 

               <P class='content'>If time permits, explore our website and 
               see for yourself all of the used and reconditioned machinery we have to offer.



               <P class='content'><Span class='content_label'>Blanchard Rotary Surface Grinders: </span>  
               We've been selling both used and reconditioned Blanchard grinders for well over thirty 
               five years. Blanchard rotary surface grinders, have been in use since the early 1900's. 
               When accuracy of parallelism and flatness are required, an engineer will usually specify 
               Blanchard grinding of a part. Due to the basic design of a Blanchard type grinder, it 
               inherently compensates for much of the wear within itself and that of the grinding wheel 
               as the magnetic chuck and the grinding wheel rotate in opposite directions on the same axis 
               or plane. An experienced operator can often hold reasonably close tolerances with even a 
               worn out Blanchard, when using proper technique.
               We look forward to filling your Blanchard grinder needs.


               <P class='content'><Span class='content_label'>Horizontal Boring Mills: </span>  We've been 
               providing horizontal boring mills since 1981, quality low hour machines. For over a hundred 
               and fifty years, boring mills of some form have been in use. In the beginning, they were 
               very primitive and mostly used in the boring of larger gun barrels. They are    now used not 
               only in boring applications but also for milling, drilling, tapping and threading of large 
               parts. Mills equipped with a tailstock allow the operator to do long boring operations and 
               still hold close tolerances. Mills with a    rotary table allow parts to be rotated, allowing 
               machining of multiple sides of parts without having to reposition the parts. Mills with a 
               facing head allow facing of larger surface areas,  or perhaps the end of a large pipe.
               Considering your individual needs, we are looking forward to selling you just the right
               horizontal boring mill.

               <P class='content'><Span class='content_label'>OBI & Gap Frame Presses: </span>   We provide both OBI 
               and Gap presses, used and reconditioned. If you're in the market for a press of either type, 
               you have come to the right website.  There are now numerous manufacturers of both obi and gap 
               presses. We sell Aida, Bliss, Clearing, Komatsu, Minster and Niagara. Minster is still the most 
               popular brand but Bliss runs a close second place. Aida and Komatsu brands are also very popular 
               these days as well. Obi and gap frame type presses are built as single or double crank depending 
               on bed width, tonnage etc. OBI presses are offered as flywheel types or back geared types. The 
               flywheel type is the most popular due to the extra speed provided. We hope you will contact us 
               to discuss your particular needs in your metal stamping application. We are eager to help you in 
               acquiring a late model high quality obi or gap frame press.

               <P class='content'><Span class='content_label'>Power Squaring Shears: </span>  We sold our first power 
               squaring  shear over thirty five years ago. We sell both mechanical and hydraulic type shears, 
               used and reconditioned.  Both mechanical and hydraulic type power squaring shears  are widely 
               used today in metal fabrication shops as well as in manufacturing plants. Hydraulic type shears 
               have become the most popular due to their versatility and safety advantages. We specialize in power 
               squaring shears that have a thickness  capacity of one quarter inch or more and a width capacity of   
               ten feet or more. Shears in this size/capacity range are where   we can save our customers the most 
               time and money because  new ones are very expensive and delivery times can be long.  We sell all the 
               most popular brands. The key is to choose the  right shear for your particular application. Contact 
               us soon so  we can sell you the right power squaring shear.      

               <P class='content'><Span class='content_label'>Press Brakes: </span>  We offer used and reconditioned press 
               brakes  for your metal fabrication shop or manufacturing plant.  Hydraulic press brakes are the most 
               popular today due to the  versatility they offer, as well as their safety advantages. With  today's 
               cnc controls and advanced hydraulics, press brakes are  capable of making complex bends with speed 
               and accuracy. We sell all major brands such as Amada, Allsteel, Cincinnati,  Dreis and Krump, HTC, 
               LVD, Niagara, Pacific and Wysong.  We specialize in press brakes of 135 tons capacity or greater,  
               since this is the capacity range where we will save you, our  customer, the most time and money. New 
               press brakes are a bit expensive and delivery times are usually several months.  The savings which we 
               will typically provide with a used or reconditioned brake can be substantial. Contact us today, so we 
               can save you time and money on a quality press brake.

              <P class='content'><Span class='content_label'>Reciprocating Surface Grinders:  </span> We offer and sell all 
              sizes    and brands of surface grinders, used and reconditioned.  Reciprocating surface grinders with 
              horizontal spindle are for sure, a basic component of virtually every machine shop now as well as 
              maintenance departments of manufacturing plants. It would be difficult to find a machine shop or a 
              maintenance shop that didn't have at least one surface grinder. We sell popular brands such as Acer, 
              Brown & Sharpe, Boyar Shultz, Chevalier, Do-All, Elb, Gallmeyer & Livingston, Kent, Mattison, Okamoto, 
              Parker-Majestic, and Thompson. Among the smaller and medium size grinders, Okamotos are presently the 
              most popular; Supertech is an up and coming brand also.  Among larger grinders, Mattison is the most 
              popular brand. In  all size grinders, we especially try to have available ones with incremental down-feed 
              as this feature is very much in demand.  Contact us now, for a quality reciprocating surface grinder.

              <P class='content'><Span class='content_label'>Straight Side Stamping Presses: </span>  Finding a straight side 
              press with the right bed, stroke, speed, shut height and window size, is not easy these days, not to 
              mention, finding a certain brand.  We work hard helping people acquire the press they want.  There are 
              now several popular brands of straight side stamping presses like Aida, Bliss, Clearing, Komatsu, Stamtec, 
              Verson and of course, Minster, the most popular brand. We invest a lot of time in search of Minster 
              presses; though it has become more and more of a challenge locating them, especially those with all the 
              specs that most buyers want.  Regardless of brand, it is our goal to buy stamping presses that have been 
              well maintained and ones with relatively low hours on them. Once we find presses of this caliber, we are 
              sure we can offer you the customer, top quality presses that will serve you well in your stamping operation.
              Send us an email or give us a call if you're in the market for a used or reconditioned straight side 
              stamping press. 

              <P class='content'><Span class='content_label'>Vertical Boring Mills / Vertical Turret Lathes: </span> We provide  
              used and reconditioned vertical boring mills and "VTLs" of all sizes and brands.  We sell all major brands 
              like G&amp;L, Bullard, King, Gray, Betts, Dorries, Tos, Froriep, Skoda, Niles, Shibaura, Cincinnati, and Webster 
              & Bennett. Bullard CutMasters, are surely popular in smaller to medium size machines. We continuously search 
              for them and normally have them available.  Many of the late model vertical boring mills and VTLs have now 
              been converted to cnc, making it very difficult to locate good late model manual machines. We therefore, 
              invest a lot of time and travel in search of desirable manual machines.  If you're now in the market to buy 
              a vertical boring mill, let us  know the chuck size, height under the rail, type of work heads and other 
              things needed. We'll do our best to provide you with a first class used or reconditioned vertical boring mill 
              or VTL.
