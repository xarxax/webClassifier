            This is a Tribute CD I put together on my Dad & Uncle. During the 1st
Delmore Days Festival, our publisher was supposed to bring Delmore
Music CDs to sell. However, she went to Athens, GA when the event was
in Athens, Alabama. She drove a long way to go to the wrong place. We
had a lot of people wanting to buy Delmore Brothers music and didn't
have any! Well we had a good laugh out of that story, but it gave me
an idea to do my own CD for the Delmore Brothers. The very week after
the Delmore Days' Festival, I went into the studio and made this CD.
It was songs only until the Engineer told me that "I ought to tell
some of the stories I knew about my Dad & Uncle", so I did. We had it
done in a week. It is available by contacting Debby Delmore at

	I'm
      so glad you stopped by. Hopefully you will get to know a more
      personal side of the <B><I>'Delmore Brothers'</I></B> from this
      website. There will be stories from family &amp; friends, lots
      of pictures, special links and current news regarding the Delmore
      Brothers.<BR>
<BR>
      I feel so blessed to have been born a 'Delmore' that I hope to
      show through pictures &amp; personal stories, how life really
      was for my family. Rabon &amp; Nola had no children and eventually
      divorced. Alton &amp; Thelma had 5. From oldest to youngest:
      <B>Billie Anne, Norma Gail, Lionel, Susan &amp; Debby</B>. Susan
      died at the tender age of 4, the cause being an enlarged heart.
      My family was so devastated that I, too, not having even known
      her, feel the same sorrow as the rest of my family. Lionel is also deceased.<BR>
<BR>
      Even though I was only 11 years old when my daddy died, he left
      me educated on his musical life. He always told me to do all
      I could to never let his music die. I would ask &quot;How&quot;
      and he would tell me I would know, that God would show me. Hopefully
      this website will be one way to do that.<BR>
<BR>
      Although I'm not an entertainer, I understand how music lifts our 
      spirits when we are happy and comforts us when we are sad. My goal 
      is to preserve, promote and reveal Delmore Brothers' music to future 
      generations.<BR><!--Although I'm not an entertainer, I understand how music lifts
      our spirits and makes us feel. I was always taught that music
      is a gift from God and to never abuse it. So my goal is to help
      preserve their music for future generations. Lionel however,
      is the only one of us who pursued a musical career. He was also
      blessed with musical talents.<BR>-->
<BR>
      We didn't have a TV until I was 6 years old but I never did miss
      it, because my home was filled with music, sometimes night &amp;
      day! I would be very lost in life right now had I not grown up
      surrounded by music! It comforts me when I'm sad and elevates
      my happiness when I'm happy! Being born into a musical family
      is so different from a 'regular' family I can't even begin to
      describe how. By the time I came along my family's life was changing
      dramatically. My daddy quit performing professionally in 1952,
      the year I was born &amp; sadly the year Susan &amp; Uncle Rabon
      died. My family eventually settled in Huntsville, Alabama. My
      mom started working as a waitress &amp; my daddy was making a
      living from his royalties &amp; giving music lessons.<BR>
<BR>
      I remember lots of my dad's friends dropping by the house or
      if they happened to be putting a show on in Huntsville we would
      go see them. Some of the people that I met during that period
      were: Merle Travis, Grandpa Jones, Ira &amp; Charlie Louvin,
      Lonnie Glosson, Wayne Raney, the Happy Goodman Family &amp; Merle
      Kilgore. These are just the ones I remember. I'm sure there were
      more than that. At that time I had no clue who I was in the midst
      of. All of these people to me were simply our good friends. I
      have so many special memories that I will share them with you
      at different times through this website. I have met many wonderful
      people because of my daddy's &amp; uncle's music.<BR>
<BR>
      <img src="http://delmorebrothers.net/images/wmc.jpg" align="left" width="200" hspace="10" vspace="10">Daddy &amp; Uncle Rabon never forgot that music is a gift from
      God. They were very blessed and knew it was God who gave them
      their talents! They didn't start in the music business for the
      money or glory. They did it for the simple reason, they loved
      what they did! Big money &amp; awards in their day were unheard
      of! Hopefully I can share with everyone the fascinating story
      of my daddy &amp; uncle from a daughter's (and niece's) point
      of view!<BR>
<BR>
      Thanks for dropping by &amp; please stop by for another visit.
      Take Care &amp; God Bless You,<BR>
