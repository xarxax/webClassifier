<H1> After 20 years of providing meals to my clients, with love, We Cook For You is Forced to end service due to health reasons. </H1>
<H3> Message from Becky: I've loved cooking for you. I've met so many wonderful people, their parents and children. I've laughed with you, celebrated with you, and cried with you. I'll miss you. <BR>

Thank you for our time together. </H3>
