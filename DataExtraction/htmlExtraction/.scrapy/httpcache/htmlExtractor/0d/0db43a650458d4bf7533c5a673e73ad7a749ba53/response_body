With MoldedGear on your team, you have
    access to three world-class professional services: our New Product Design,
    Design for Manufacturability, and Inspection and Qualification services. If
    you are a design engineer, an injection molder, an entrepreneur without an
    expert engineering team, or an area buyer is using an expensive motor gear,
    you?ve come to the right place for solutions. Zoltan
    Sostarecz is a gear design specialist with more than ten years experience in the plastic
    industry. He holds a Master of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Technical University of
    Budapest, Hungary (1986). 
Mr. Sostarecz was the Lead Product
    Designer, for a QS 9000 plastic injection molder and gearing expert company
    in Connecticut. He was a member of the technical support team and served as the internal design consultant.
    He has also managed metal to plastic conversions and has been involved in
    the design, manufacturing, and testing of many injection molded gears,
    pulleys, and gearboxes in the past ten years. He demonstrated keen
    analytical skills by performing computer-aided gear design with PGT, UTS,
    PowerGear, Software Engineering Service, and several self-authored software
    packages. He presented a ?Comparative Evaluation of Design Software for
    Plastic Gears.? He summarized the collected information about available
    gear design software. He was also an active member of the AGMA
    Plastic Gearing Committee, which released the new standard for plastic
    gearing. He is a member of the Society of Plastic Engineers and the American
    Society of Mechanical Engineers. He has been involved in more than a 100
    different projects, including: powder metal and plastic gear design, noise
    analysis, problem solving, automatic mail handling, thermal inkjet laser
    printers, copiers, automotive HVAC rotary actuator, spiral bevel, household goods,
    surgical medical, cameras and related, laser related, test &amp; measurement
    equipment. These complex projects required product design, injection molded
    tool design, or qualification of injection-molded products.
