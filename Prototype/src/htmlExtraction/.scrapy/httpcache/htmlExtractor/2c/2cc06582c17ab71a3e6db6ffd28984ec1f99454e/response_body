This functioning ofthe creative mind, later characterized finely by the French poet, Rimbaud,as the derangement or disordering of the perceptive faculties in orderto allow for real vision (<i>le d&eacute;r&eacute;gl&eacute;ment de tousles senses </i>), ever seeks the new and unpredictable muse. For Rimbaud,however, the tendency is toward a dissipated intoxication with egotisticnovelty. Blake’s disordering of the conventional is not an end in itselfnor merely the means toward an <i>avant garde</i> art. Rather, it is therevolutionary alchemy of a salvational transformation of the mind, perceptionsand emotions of the human individual. This process is geared towards notonly the mirroring of the idea of a divine Man, or Christ, but also thecreation of that nature within each person so revivified. It is the reconstitutionof the "fallen," unrealized nature of mankind. Blake’s artistic self-salvationenacts, in essence, the <i>creation</i> of the soul through imaginativeactivity. Made unteleological by its emphasis upon the freeing-up of energiesand the loosing of bindings from the perceptive and conceptual faculties,it is a way wherein the process of self-creation through vision is all.Where teleological thinking argues an inherent purpose of existence, Blakeposits emphatically that what meaning there is in life is that which wemake, and that realities are conditioned by mental perspective. Thus hedefines the real distinction between human beings as that between the artisticallyawakened and those who accept reality as given.</font><p><font face="Geneva">In a work of art like <u>The Marriage of Heavenand Hell</u>, in which artistic alchemy creates a roiling boil of radicalizedelements (as well as--one can well imagine--in his appearance to all butthe most open-minded of his contemporaries), Blake displays a threateningtype of mental activity. He deranges the ordinary in the name of the eschatologicalfuture and the salvation of humanity: here seeming opposites can be fusedinto collaborative new elements, redintegrated from a fallen state of rationalizedchaos and the material restrictions of a false ordering of reality. Perhapsit takes a madman to see the future</font><p><font face="Geneva">--especially the future of art.</font><p><font face="Geneva">By nearly all of the normative standards of hisday, William Blake was strangely inverted, wrapped in idiosyncrasy, seeminglylacking an advanced, formal style in his art, and clear, sensible thoughtin his poetry. Yet he, more than any poet of his day in England, saw theas yet unformulated ways in which art and knowledge were to advance. AsEvelyn Underhill characterizes his and other "mystics’" making of new propheticand visionary "maps,"</font><p><font face="Geneva">Such maps are often wild in drawing, because gooddraught-</font><p><font face="Geneva">manship does not necessarily go with a talent forexploration.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Departing from the usual convention, they are hard-- some-</font><p><font face="Geneva">times impossible -- to understand. As a result,the orthodox</font><p><font face="Geneva">have been forced to regard their makers as madmenor heretics:</font><p><font face="Geneva">when they were really only practical men strugglingto disclose</font><p><font face="Geneva">great matters by imperfect means" (104).</font><p><font face="Geneva">However, when understood within its own idiom andon its own terms, Blake’s poetic works and pictorial art are coherent andconsistent, however idiosyncratically unique. His art is undoubtedly themost radical of its time, and obviously the most visionary. We need notstretch hindsight to see Blake’s prescience of modern micro- and macrocosmicphysics, as well as his anticipation (and solution?) of the dilemmas ofpostmodern irony.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Nearly unread in his own era, it seems that criticalattention had to wait to achieve a safe distance from the man himself beforesensitive scrutiny commenced. Even at our safe distance, the majority ofreaders of Blake, as well as many of his anthologizers (even such as Yeats),seem to prefer the simplified and quaint in his writings, the aphorismsand angels which could be placed upon greeting cards. This is a dangerousneglect, for lurking beneath the seeming platitudes is a mind of marvelousmonstrosities and radical visions--that of the creator of a mythic systemmore outlandish and perhaps more complete than any other preceding it incultural history. Blake is especially radical--though not without someprecedent and context in such literary figures as Milton’s Lucifer--inhis conception of the role of the imagination. An unimaginative appreciationof Blake seems oxymoronic at best: his art <i>demands</i> active participation.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Surface-level readings of Blake actually stand,unknowingly, upon the verge of a great, visionary abyss. Perhaps somewhatmad, and constructing models of reality to correspond with his madness,Blake still predicts and in many areas exceeds the problematics of thelate 20th century. His seeming inversions and contortions allow for thefreedom of relativity and undecidability, and are ideologically orientedtoward a libertarian obviation of oppressive social modalities. They arethe outward vestments of a redemptive model of higher sanity, one whichviews the world of the ordinary mental representation of reality as patheticallyfallen from its potential and degraded in quality, limited to such a degreethat it constitutes a hell. Blake’s poetic mission is to destroy the falsenorms, dualities and tropes of this fallen state--to pull down its falsegods, to war with all of the teleologies of limited visions and to reinstantiatethe human collectivity to its proper state of "Edenic" consciousness. Theattainment of this state requires, for Blake like Dante before him, a fullprogress through the infernal and purgatorial. No small mission, this,the Edenic goal being far from quaint and flowery. Pure creativity reignsin Blake’s vision of Paradise, where the occupation of eternity is unlimitedimagination ever moving between the horror and wonder of the sublime--amarrying of Heaven and Hell.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Philosophically, this state is not easily achieved;all of existence within time and space is, for Blake, a dialectical warof visions. Even Eden, both as origin and end, is not a simple world ofharmony, but rather a dynamic state of interrelation, multiplicity andunending possibility. Truth itself is not teleological, for it is the variegated,congregate procession of this warring universality of heavens and hells--notas a sum total, but as a synergetic process of cyclic self-generation.In <u>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</u>, Blake demonstrates his principlethat reality is dialogical in nature, that "in opposition is true friendship,"wherein the only real enemy is the limitation of the mind and the body,through the damning of their wellsprings of imaginative vision and pleasurefulsensory apprehension.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Blake does not present himself as a mystic, longingfor some other world than the one he was born into; nor is he a mere philosopher,seeking sensible and logical definitions of being and knowledge. Rather,he works as a "prophet"--but not in the popular sense implying predictiveforeknowledge. More like the old Hebrew prophets, he works toward reform.His prophetic work seeks not for vague future possibilities, not doom normetaphysical apotheosis, but for the nature of reality as it actually is,as it would be experienced by human beings were they only actively andcreatively to see. It must be recognized that for Blake this reality andvision are not static truths, but processes of continuous creativity. Redintigrationand eschatology for Blake are ever-present actualities within a visionof reality where consciousness, in its form as "poetic genius" or imagination,functions as the prime determinant. Time, space and visionary activityof the mind are recombinant in a radical and vital sort of alchemy. Thisalchemical heterogeneity of the process, both of elements within the psycheand outward participants in the visionary universe, exceeds and negatesany charge of solipsism that may be leveled upon Blake; all things andbeings involve one another mutually in this creative process of meaningmaking, even in apparent contrariety or isolation.</font><p><font face="Geneva">The major, later prophetic works of Blake are granddramas, ostensibly ontological and eschatological in nature, which arein fact depictions of the struggle for illumination through the imaginativelyheroic of aspects within the momentarily timebound individual psyche. Laterworks such as <u>The Four Zoas</u> portray great and horrific strugglesbetween entities who are fragmented elements of a single consciousnesswhich once existed in a state of diversity in unity, yet has fallen intodisintegrative dysfunction. The redintigration of this entity is the missionof the poet-as-prophet and, in Blake’s model, is a coming to sanity whichis enacted through the individual’s capacity to imagine it as real andpossible. Through this imaginative activity--here, the act of writing poetry,or of engraving and colorizing--the epistemology of the self is rectifiedand clarified, the illusion of death and deadenedness shuffled off, andthe world is made, through the realization of any one man’s poetic genius,personally and figuratively if not actually and globally whole.</font><p><font face="Geneva">It must be remembered that although he posits aunitary being, Blake is by no means a monist. The Edenic state of Albion,the eternal Man, is portrayed in the Zoas as participatory: all of hisfaculties work together within himself as potentialities which are evernew, diverse and surprising. The difference is that in the fallen statethere is no realization of this synthetic and synergetic process; yet,in <u>Heaven and Hell</u> a "friendship" in opposition arises, an unacknowledgedmutuality which renders enemies allies, and makes seeming doom fortuitouslytransformative, which inverts and transposes even the most accepted truthsand falsities as well as common conceptions of good and evil. The conventionaland traditional teleologies of salvation and damnation are rendered inertand false by the weight which Blake places upon individual consciousnessas it proceeds through the labyrinthian prisons of mind fallen from itsstatus as Creator, envisioner and magician of being. An individual of Blake’spersuasion no longer requires the vicarious atonement of an external Messiah;rather, s/he is potentially the Word which predated Creation, and whichenacts it through a divine creativity (John 1:i-iii).</font><p><font face="Geneva"><u>The Songs of Innocence and Experience</u> portrays,as a whole work, the dialectical progress of consciousness into fateful,yet powerful and necessary self-knowledge. The lamb becomes the tiger,by transfiguration the artist of the Songs, who frames his own "fearfulsymmetry." He frames the unframeable, revealing the dynamic, raging chaosof potential meaning and the prodigious diversity of an ever-diversifying,uncontrollable reality of being. This symbolic tiger is undecidable, chameleonic,mercurial--an apt figure for the infernal imagination and its wild energyof creation. The lamb of Innocence must fall to achieve selfhood. It hasto become the demonic and incendiary tiger of Experience, transformingitself to a god-like state of metamorphosed innocence. As these statesare cyclic, not linear or mutually exclusive, so are they constantly reflectiveof one another, discursive and commingling. This cycle repeats itself throughoutBlake’s work, arising most notably and significantly as the Orc-Urizencycle, wherein no rational ordering of the universe can exist for longat the expense of rampant energy without giving rise to new generativeand imaginative profusions. No telos may long stand, as with any othertrope or passing fashion. These made meanings feed upon one another, needone another, as they continuously reconstitute the very fabric or bothorganic reality and human society and understanding. The result is bestrepresented by and understood as a fugue, a melding of seeming oppositesin a complex, higher order of being within which forces and states of beingare collaborative and mutually informative.</font><p><font face="Geneva">The artist of the earlier song cycles steps intothe discursive and violent worlds of <u>Heaven and Hell</u> as into purificatoryflames of selfhood, into a furious gauntlet between voices and viewpoints,which model the flux and chaos of the objective realm. Progress throughthis trial, though, is not made by reaching its end, but rather in there-seeing of it, in the re-making of it through vision. Ontologically andepistemologically, it is a process of self-creation which defies telos,which places the eschato-logical moment always and ever in the presentof Judgment in the imagination. The Judgment is not final, but perpetualand personal; therefore there is no end to which history leads, and nodetermining principle governing all actions or visions. The present andthe future of liberatory and radical, evolutionary consciousness require,rather, a constant discernment--aesthetically, philosophically and perceptually--betweenthe limiting and the free, the blinding and the visionary. If the activeperceiver creates realities, then responsibility falls upon the creator;and if this process is continual and cyclic, then there can be no finalend to it. To rest from labor, for Blake, can only temporarily satisfy;without further activity, only a new Urizen-reign necessitating overthrowwill have been achieved. Contrary to the theology of the Judgment, Blakeimplies that what is required is constant aesthetic and moral reappraisalof the states of being which arise in an ever-fluctuating, living universe.</font><p><font face="Geneva">If there is infinity behind the cleansed "doorsof perception," then, by definition, there are infinite possibilities ofcreation which the mind may generate in relation to unlimitedness. Thisimplies not so much that the mind, freed of limited perception, would seean absolute or final, established "Truth," "Beauty" or "Reality," but ratherthat it would use the creative faculty of perception transtemporally andtrans-spacially as a prophet would, or as an artist does in envisaging,translating and formulating potentialities. As is said in "Auguries ofInnocence": "We are led to <i>Believe</i> a Lie / When we see not <i>Thro</i>the Eye" [italics added]. Here Blake makes the important distinction thatvision is an action which proceeds <i>outward</i> from the self to theworld; it is an activity which formulates the qualitative reality of whatis seen, not one which is subject to the givens of the objective and external.This has everything to do, as we shall see, with two of the "Proverbs ofHell" from Heaven and Hell: first that, "Where man is not nature is barren,"and secondly that, "Truth can never be told so as to be understood, andnot believ’d." That Blake places his focus upon the "cleansing" of perceptiveconsciousness, and not primarily upon the infinity beyond the limitations,is really the key to everything in his philosophy--he desires energy andexuberance of development, not an abstracted and passive infinity. Thathe proposes truth as made by the perceiver places his philosophy far inadvance of his time--it makes him quite contemporary indeed, as he anticipatesthe relativistic and undecidable situation of modernity and offers tenablesolutions to current problematics. Through joyously purgatorial re-imagination,mankind in Blake’s conception is free to experience any joy or hell, capableof escaping from the horrid ironies and tyrannies of the human past andpresent to a world the fineness of which is limited only by the degreeof freedom we ascribe to our own imaginative abilities.</font><p><font face="Geneva"><u>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</u>, a consciousupturning of the mythic soil of the Judaeo-Christian legacy, aims not atnegation or mere satire (as Harold Bloom claims at the opening of his commentaryto the Erdman edition), but allows for complexity and dialogical heterogeneityhidden within normative and accepted cultural models. Truth, for Blake,is not something that has been or may ever be legislated; it must continu-ouslybe created, negotiated anew under the aegis of the imagination. The infernalimagination of Heaven and Hell, as we shall see, is not contrary to a God,<i>per se</i>, but opposes the static and inert, that which lacks the vitalitywhich cardinally signifies the activated and living mind. That religionis one link in the chain of collective "mind forg’d manacles" for Blakedoes not make him the enemy of divinity or the advocate of evil. Simply,it is his method to reveal--alchemically, or via the engraver’s methodof the excision of obfuscatory layerings of illusion--the hidden dynamismand force which the socially and intellectually stagnating, normative hermeneuticsand behavior of convention seek to repress. His ideological force stemsfrom outraged rebellion; yet his revolutionary force seethes, like thefallen and damned Lucifer, at the core of the mind in creative fire. Heshows no desire to storm the walls of some petty castle or other from without.For Blake, this internality and infernality of the poetic impulse is thesecret of its power. In accordance with this view, <u>Heaven and Hell</u>cannot be seen as mere irony or satire--it does not seek merely to lampoonor comment from a safe distance, but rather works from within, seekingthe most vital chain reaction and trans-formation of vision and human consciousness.</font><p><font face="Geneva"><u>PLATE 1</u>:</font><p><font face="Geneva">If we turn to Blake’s illuminated title page forhis book (figure 1), we see the first three words, "The Marriage of...,"placed above an horizontal line which represents the surface of the earthin a world of</font><p><font face="Geneva">winter-barren trees and pale human figures. Belowthis line between the seen and unseen, the outer and inner worlds, lurksa much more potent realm of dynamic and explosive energy and interactivedualism, wherein we find the rest of the title, "...Heaven and Hell," boldlywritten. Here, in the internality of the psyche, two figures embrace andkiss, one coming forth from billowing flames, the other lying upon heavyclouds, immersed in the "deep" or abyss (within which Rintrah howls onthe next page of the book). It is clear from this picture that Blake intendshis work to concern itself, ultimately, with an alchemical conjunctionand transubstantiation of the world, both in its aspects as physical andas psychological realities. Despite the rage and apparent dualism whichwe find once the text commences on the next page, here we see a demonicand an angelic entity "married" in a relationship of synergetic symbiosiswhich will, seemingly, overthrow or transform the world of surface above.The bleak yet peaceable realm on the surface represents the unseeing, limitedmind which lives within the ordinary world of appearances and human socialactivity; but the one below, which is given so much more attention andemphasis by the artist, erupts with the volcanic force of spring or vengeanceinto the world above. Human figures rise, in attitudes of transcendence,from the flames and clouds toward the dividing line, indicating that thisfusion in marriage will be a transmutation of both worlds. A suppressedreality and state of being will, in Blake’s prophecy which follows thispage, be unveiled in the epiphanic activity coming from the core of humanpsychological and spiritual reality.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Blake’s dividing line between salvation and damnationdiffers from that of Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel "Last Judgment," whereinChrist’s sweeping gesture of arm separates the two realms for eternity;rather, Blake views damnation only as the failure to recognize the vitaland transformative dynamic which underlies reality and the mind. Damnationfor Blake is simply the lack of vision, and the barrenness of perception,feeling and experience, which are the inevitable consequences of a mindwhich is not activated in and propelled into being by the force of freedand generative imagination.</font><p><font face="Geneva"><u>PLATE 2 -- The Argument</u>:</font><p><font face="Geneva">The "Argument," which opens Heaven and Hell textually,establishes a basis for the prophetic function of the poet, the visionaryexile and outsider. It presents a creation myth which depicts a fall froma kind of Eden particular to Blake’s dialectical poetic vision--elementsof good and evil, pre- and post-lapsarian states of being, mix and blur.There is an obvious opposition here between the "just man" and the "sneakingserpent," but many ambiguities dwell in the apparent simplicity of thisopening statement. Although it commences with the rage of an apparent protagonistof the poem, Rintrah, who is driven from a "meek" and "just" state to oneof "rag[ing] in the wilds" and shaking of "fires," there is a sense inwhich the enemy actually functions as ally in a dynamic which surmountsand surpasses such concepts as good and evil. Although bracketed by therefrain of the rage of Rintrah standing among doomful "burdened air," overa consuming "deep" full of the gravity of "hungry clouds," the body ofthe section, in its explanations of the origins of this prophetic rage,does not define its figures as absolutely distinct. In fact, the illuminatedtext (figure 2) shows a scene which suggests the temptation of Eve by theSerpent of Genesis, but which actually looks more like an exchange, a "handingor receiving" (Erdman 99), or a meeting of two characterized domains. Theinteraction seems to take place in the surface world of the title page--yetwhere leaves are beginning to spring from the trees--suggesting a stateof being not yet developed to the transforming potency of the subterranean"Eternal Hell" which is soon to "revive" (in plate 3) and overthrow thebarren world of surfaces and broken dichotomies. It may depict a momentjust before the Fall, but this fall is "fortunate" (<i>felix culpa</i>), as it activates the dynamic which spiritually fecundates the world.</font><p><font face="Geneva">The oppositions presented in the text, even theterrain itself, are strangely mixed and complex, presenting greater spatial,temporal and moral complexities than those portrayed in the conventional,Biblical or theological telling of Man’s Fall. Blake re-presents the mythhere in the</font><p><font face="Geneva">struggle of one man, who is an Adam, an Abel madea Cain, as well as Luciferian in his quasi-Messianic struggles. Rintrahis born from what seems to be an already corrupted world wherein, despitethe residue of Eden, nothing is without ambiguity. At first a "just man"is pictured, spoken of in the mythic past-tense, who was once "meek, andin a perilous path," and "kept his course along / The vale of death." Thisis a hearkening back to a golden age in many ways, to a time where thejust could keep his own path without interruption; and yet, it is not sogolden as it seems, as the presence of peril and death indicate. The man’sjustness may be his keeping of this strict way between the opposites whichabound around him, but his virtue does not make him immune. The world hereis depicted as already fraught with dichotomy and opposition, yet not totallyfallen into senseless chaos.</font><p><font face="Geneva">The tense then shifts, oddly, into an aphoristicpresent-tense: "Roses are planted where thorns grow. / And on the barrenheath / Sing the honey bees." In these lines one may detect strains ofthe Biblical trope of lions lying with lambs in Edenic harmony. There isa sense of fecundity, seen in the flowers and fertilizing bees. How, then,do we explain the tension which exists in the human realm here? Part ofthe answer lies in the natural realm, depicted here quite strangely. Theimage of roses growing amongst thorns echoes the parable of Jesus regardingthe "seeds of faith" sown amongst menacing and thwarting weeds; yet therose is itself a thorn-bearing plant (perhaps another irony of the fallenstate). Also, although the bees seem to prosper, the landscape is wastedand barren. Nature exists here in only seeming well-being and harmony;it is left to the human being to bear the consciousness of corruption andburden of redemption from such a state of barrenness. The cryptic shiftto the present-tense in these lines suggests that this admixture of statesand principles continues, a truism of the fallen state, yet one which stillat least mirrors a lost Eden.</font><p><font face="Geneva">The next lines are shifted again to a legendarypast-tense, one which moves backward to a time before the that of the firstlines, speaking of the creation of the "perilous path." It is almost asif the telling of this myth is moving backwards through time, gravitatingunconsciously towards the ontology of the Fall. The path is said to havebeen "planted," suggesting that it is organic or botanical in nature, aform of the biological determinism of Blake’s realm of Generation (developedmore fully in the Four Zoas). Besides implying this shackling of mankindto matter, the word also suggests something which has been <i>placed</i>down upon the earth; but it is due to the fall from comprehensive beingrather than a teleological necessity or theological stricture. The pathis perilous because mankind must reconstitute lucidity in a world whereeverything is strangely juxtaposed, where rivers and springs flow overor from cliffs and tombs. The "bleached bones" of a long-deadened worldbecome that from which "red clay," the Adamic (Bloom 897) or human principle,brings forth in a somehow perverse creativity and unconscious propagation.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Into this state enters a "villain," a "sneakingserpent" (the prototype of the later "covering cherub" of false selfhood),who yet "walks" as a man would, and "drives[s] / The just man into barrenclimes." This usurper takes the place of the just man with hypocritical"mild humility," distorting with sly "ease" the rigorous justness of theother, even taking on the image of pious sanctity whilst the just man isexiled to a state of savagery and madness. The tense is shifted again inthe last lines before the refrain, suggesting that this state of misappropriationis ongoing and contemporary. The world we enter here is usurped, ambivalentand gothic in its odd ambiguity. Even the language used to describe itis lexically, semantically and grammatically grotesque and contorted. Already,at this early point in the book, the reader must despair of a literal,monological reading. The force of Blake’s meaning runs strongly throughdeceptively simplistic statements, and yet wars against conventional understanding;it undermines the most basic foundations of limited thought, wreaks havocupon inherited mythologies of origin and morality. For a contextualizationof this strangely mixed opening, we must proceed to the commencement inthe next section and its idiosyncratic appropriations of Judaeo-Christianeschatologies.</font><p><font face="Geneva"><u>PLATE 3</u>:</font><p><font face="Geneva">This plate begins with the ambiguously gendered,naked form of a human enshrouded, shackled yet "comfortable" (Erdman 100),in "strong fires." The arms of this figure (who resembles the flaming devilof the title page) open, and the legs sprawl luxuriantly as if in the pleasureof the coming "new heaven" of creative liberation or the expectancy ofbeing able to rise up from fires to a world made newly whole. The imagesuggests Orc in his fires, who breaks his bindings and unleashes Dionysianenergies upon the calcified reign of Urizen. At the page’s bottom a womangives birth to the new world--while she herself dies away--through an aspiring,Orcian infant with outstretched arms. Representing the revived dynamismof the opposites two figures, one light and the other darker, run and yetseem to fly off into brightening clouds of fiery promise.</font><p><font face="Geneva">This section begins the elaboration of Blake’s discursivevision of reality, based upon the function of contraries which are trulycomplementary. Blake announces here not only his own position in the battle,as well as his poetic-prophetic mission, but he also names those whom heopposes. These "enemies," such as Swedenborg, are actually allies in thatthey give the messianic poet somewhere to start and something to butt against.No poet so clearly exemplifies (perhaps inspires) Harold Bloom’s conceptof the "anxiety of influence" as Blake does, with his opposition here toformer masters and his later relationship of challenge with the works ofMilton, and the Bible itself. Blake is compelled to embody not only theprophetic and eschatological, but also the messianic--his mission is salvationaland ominous at once, seeking always to warn and yet overturn in the nameof the new. The clear outlines of Blake’s later philosophy of the Orc-Urizencycle of opposition has its birth here, embodied in a personal myth ofthe incarnation of divine vision and purpose. In this case, the Orcianfigure is the muse of Blake himself, opposing all that obstructs the innerdictates of creative genius. Blake must take up this mission, for his visionis inherently social, not solipsistic, and requires a sense of collectivityto give it context and meaning. The tyranny of all Urizens oppresses thepeople, not only the artist. Without new infusions, death and stagnationoccur inevitably; no tradition is alive without new challenges.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Aligning his own poetic voice and life with thoseof Christ himself, who is said to have died and risen from death at theage of thirty-three (the poet’s approximate age upon the composition ofthese lines), Blake speaks of a "new heaven" having begun. The new heaven"is begun," or already has commenced, and "it is now thirty-three yearssince its advent: the Eternal Hell revives." What, then is the nature ofthis heaven which has begun with his birth, but enacts itself through therevival of hell? The nature of this process of new heaven and eternal hellbecomes clear in the relationship of Blake’s stance to his predecessorsChrist, Swedenborg and Isaiah. Placing the philosophical master in a subservientrole, Blake embodies himself in resurrection from the tomb, from the cradleof Swedenborg and, by implication, from restrictions of the traditionaltrappings of limited theology.</font><p><font face="Geneva">There is here a bewildering admixture of extremeswhich may only be resolved via the concept of contraries. Hell is the form,later to be named as Orc, that all new visionary activity and revolutionaryexuberance must take in order to overthrow the natural conservative desireof humanity to retain control over the limited, to cling to the symbiosisof tyranny and subservience, rather than become exposed to the void ofimagination. Hell is necessary to conceive of and create the new heaven.Every self-conceived visionary is compelled to recreate the world, as veritablyas Spring requires for its fecundity the deadened waste of Winter. Thenew cannot come into being without the old; and, although he is satirizedhere, Swedenborg plays the obvious role of spiritual midwife or father.Coming into his power, however, Blake must leave behind those old cerements--outworn,teleological ideas of order and ethics, of meaning and beauty--in orderto be able to sit with angels and devils, to chat with Isaiah and Ezekiel.</font><p><font face="Geneva">The ultimate metaphor here is one of metamorphosis,both of the poet and all of humanity by prophetic proxy, to a state ofEdenic and yet increasingly hellish existence. To be fully alive and activatedin vision, one must know and live the extremes, not cling to comforts andsecure positions, for "the return of Adam into Paradise" is vitally linkedto "the dominion of Edom" over the true Israel. Blake’s New Jerusalem arisesout of battle, turmoil and extreme vision, as he shows in an allusion toIsaiah 34-5. The tone, theme and mood of these Old Testament chapters areimmediately recognizable in Blake’s own lines. The descriptions and warningsof horrible future miseries, and yet the sudden turn back to the figurativerebirth of the natural world despite (because of?) disaster, are obvioussources and parallels for Blake’s mission. The chapters of Isaiah depictthe vengeance of the Lord upon the land and people of Edom, usurping andcorrupt enemies of the true way of Zion. Likewise with Blake, the old ordersmust--and will, constantly--be overturned through opposition which thriveson that which obstructs it, which destroys all that stands in proud, authoritarianstasis. Isaiah’s re-establishment of the "Way of Holiness" is essentiallythe same as Blake’s depiction of Los rebuilding Jerusalem, the purificatoryconception that Blake repeatedly speaks of as the cleansing of "the doorsof perception," yet expressed at this level of reality in a warring metaphorof struggle and contention.</font><p><font face="Geneva">This battle of Isaiah’s, for Blake, takes placeat the heart of the physical/spiritual world, as well as at the core ofthe human psyche. As it is necessary, in order that matter exist in anapparently solid state, that atoms have electromagnetic polarities, sowith humanity: "Without Contraries is no progression. Attraction and Repulsion,Reason and Energy, Love and Hate, are necessary to Human existence." "Good&amp; Evil" are, for the "religious," merely stale abstractions from thisdynamic process. Neither is the enemy for Blake, so long as they are inactive relation. Good is simply passive to reason, and evil play an activerole in the energy of upheaval and vigorous assertion. Here, "Good is Heaven.Evil is Hell." but Blake seeks a higher or stronger, a more radically polarizedinter-relation. He seeks to make a heaven out of hell and a hell of heavenin order to reignite the energy inherent in dichotomous reality, to invokethe nuclear reaction of mental revelation.</font><p><font face="Geneva"><u>PLATE 4 -- The voice of the Devil</u>:</font><p><font face="Geneva">The infernal poet speaks in this plate with theintent further to bring a sword of dichotomy to an hermeneutic problemof theological psychology. Errors of the past are opposed by the "devil’s"abolishing amendments in the name of reinvigoration. The speaking voicecalls these "contraries," and indeed they are nearly semantical reversalsof the preceding errors of static convention. Through this voice and attitude,Blake is trying to overturn fundamental and common social, cultural andtheological understandings in order--as it were--to re-interpret his wayback to the original meanings of "all Bibles and sacred codes". In fact,though, he is not only interpreting, but rewriting these meanings.</font><p><font face="Geneva">The "voice of the Devil" seeks to use strife anddichotomy in order to right, through curative debate within the psyche,the divided entities we find illustrated at the bottom of this plate (figure4) . These figures represent the torment caused by the divisions and repressionswhich the voice seeks to destroy. One, muscular, Dionysian and chained,surrounded by fire, represents the Body and its passionate energies. Itis pulled out over a seeming chasm by the frail and effeminate yet sociallyand theologically favored Reason as it carries off the struggling, infantSoul. Here the fundamental error of theology and mystical philosophy arises:as the Apollonian principle of Reason carries off the soul it recedes towarda distant, abstract sun which is of the same principle and color in theillustrations as that of the fires which burn around the figure representativeof the bodily and earthly life. Thus, Blake points out that there is noreal division, just illusions of perception and the stubbornness of repressivethought. The problem is that they struggle <i>against</i> each other overpossession of the soul, rather than dialogically, and so remain schismaticand, respectively, chained or abstracted.</font><p><font face="Geneva">This page of the Bible of Hell, then, presents thedichotomies of religions which the author seeks to mend, divisions whichcreate the sense of the exclusive and distinctly separate states of thebody with its energies, and the soul (mind) and its reason. The separationof these principles of the human being into a non-dynamic, hierarchic polarity,according to Blake, limits energy and therefore not only consciousnessbut the joy of creation and being. Blake elucidates the distinction betweenright ideation and error in presenting three essential mistakes of theologyand giving his correspondent axioms of right perception.</font><p><font face="Geneva">The first axiom, along with its "corrected" corollary,deals with the principles of Man. Blake seeks to correct the assumptionthat there are two distinct parameters, the Body and the Soul, with thestatement that in fact there is no real division; rather, there is onedynamic and inclusive being. Differing from the exclusive model that positsa Heaven and Hell which are separated by salvation or damnation, Blake’smodel declares that it is real damnation to attempt to <i>separate</i>the elements of being into "good" and "evil." This cardinal error beginswith the failure or refusal to see that the body is <i>part</i> of thesoul, is contained within soul, and is only perceived as distinct in alimited way because the faculties of perception are correspondingly limitedin their use. That the body may seem limited and distinct from the soulbecomes, thus, a matter of consciousness: "that call'd Body is a portionof Soul discern'd by the five Senses, the chief inlets of Soul in thisage." Not, however, to rest on a flat corrective, Blake hints in the endof this declaration at his revolutionary attitude toward the perceptualfaculties, indicates again that these "inlets" must be expanded in theirsensitive use in order to allow more sense of oneself as soul in body,which body is soul. This is not to imply that the body is an illusion--acommon error of metaphysical philosophies--but that the sense of dichotomyis the problem. Human being is a dynamic process which contains both bodyand soul, which produce energy and relative, creative order in their combination.</font><p><font face="Geneva">When stigmatized by conventional religions or oppressivemoralities, energy subverts and enacts damnation within all natural processes.In conventional terms, energy comes only from the body in the form of lustsand desires. Likewise, reason is the product of something higher and entirelyseparate from the body--an abstraction which Blake sees as a grievouslyfalsely-conceived soul. Not only is energy not evil for Blake but, "Energyis the <i>only life</i> and is <i>from</i> the Body and Reason is the boundor outward circumference of Energy" (italics added). Energy, then, derivesoriginally from the body in human life, but is in no way limited to itin the ordinarily conceived sense. Rather, energy expands within a kindof bubble of consciousness within which the sense of soul continually generatesitself, of which reason merely defines the limits of current understandingand comprehensibility. Thus, when activated, energy <i>is</i> life and,as it grows further into activity, the bounds of self must inevitably expandas reason is forced to understand its productions.</font><p><font face="Geneva">This process, confirmed in Blake’s third set ofprinciples, shows that the exercise of energies entails no bullying condemnationto hell. For Blake (in a formulation much akin to Einstein’s E=MC<sup>2</sup>,where energy and matter are equated, given a factor of acceleration), "Energyis Eternal Delight." In other words, the heaven of eternity is the delightin energy, most highly realized in the creative activity of the imagination,but equally valid in the sensual revelries of the human body. Contraryto common judgments, damnation does not occur as the result of the exerciseof energies, but manifests as the horrid state of being which arises whenenergy is repressed.</font><p><font face="Geneva"><u>PLATES 5-6 (elaboration upon Plate 4)</u>:</font><p><font face="Geneva">The consequences of falsifying inversions are furtherexplained in these plates by a strange jumble of equally inverted Biblicalapocrypha, Gnosticicsms and slightly altered phrasings which result inhuge doctrinal differences. The most important aspect of this segment isin its emphasis upon the interpretive process within theology and poetry,wherein a book such as the Bible may mean many things when seen from relativeand ideological perspectives, "For this history has been adopted by bothparties." Meaning is not only negotiated, it is a battleground of understanding.For Blake this process does not seem to be wholly a negative one. Rather,despite his conviction as to what is right and correct, he seems to relishthe hermeneutic battle with no small amount of humor and approval. It isall necessary within the dialogic development of human consciousness.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Logically, this segment of the book seems a jumblebefore careful analysis. Several versions of the myth of the Fall are given,but what prevails is a theory of the human constitution which uses desireas its basis and puts ultimate responsibility in the hands of the humanindividual. Blake states later that without the mind of man and his creativeimagination nature is barren; but here he goes even further, implying thatwithout desire man <i>himself</i> is barren. Desire is the root of humanlife for Blake, the fount of ideas and the source of motivation. Reason,as the mere circumference of comprehended and assimilated desire, cannotlogically be the ruling force of human life. It is a usurper of the properplace of desire and the imagination, the source not only of individualself-tyrannizing, but also of larger social tyranny: "Those who restraindesire, do so because theirs is weak enough to be restrained; and the restrainerof reason usurps its place &amp; governs the unwilling. And being restrain'dit by degrees becomes passive till it is only the shadow of desire." Theimplication here--with significant presaging of Nietzsche--is that thosewhose desire is so weak as to be restrainable are not quite worthy of beingdefined as realized models of the human being; but as such people as thesemove beyond personal tyranny to a governing of others with usurping reason,they are hardly human at all. Blake’s seeks, then, to achieve through hisart the fully-accomplished Man, who becomes as a god, knowing both goodand evil internally, consubstantial with supreme creative Being, as isChrist (in Blake’s iconoclastic view). When desire is diminished, however,a "restrainer of reason," or the prosaic common sense of the fallen world,enters in and governs the "unwilling soul." In this state, the human beingis indeed damned, and bound into the world of limitations and constraint--thetrue hell for the ideally self-creative soul and mind. Human passionateexistence becomes merely "the shadow of desire," and the imagination isexiled from its proper role as cosmic percipient and co-creator. Desirecannot be forever restrained this side of death, though, as Blake’s laterworks stress in their depiction of the binding of Orc by Los and Urizen,and the inevitable centripetal and centrifugal revolutions which follow.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Behind the scenario on Plates 5 and 6 is the inversionof larger forces of being as manifest in human nature and the fallen universe,of false gods and usurping Messiahs claiming domains rightly held by otherforces. Constant upheaval, as seen in the image of a falling Phaeton atthe head of the plate (figure 5), and radical contradiction prevail. Anextremely chaotic state, it yet erupts with wild forces of potentiality.Metaphorically, this suggests an imbalance in the human psyche, but isplayed out here in the guises of devils, archangels and gods. As allegoricalexegesis, these plates are like a collage of mythologies in which Blakesets up an almost indecipherable dialogue of meanings. What one is leftwith at the end is not a sense of clear meaning; rather,</font><p><font face="Geneva">the meaning is that very interplay between the "parties"which lobby for final hegemony. This dynamic, and not a static hermeneutic,is Blake’s goal; and it is set in the parameters of a debate.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Blake starts with Milton, his prophetic predecessor,and explains the scenario in Paradise Lost, wherein "the Governor of Reasonis call'd Messiah," and the source of the Fall is Lucifer’s refusal toserve, which gave rise to "sin and death" for mankind. However, Blake contraststhis configuration with that of the Old Testament Book of Job wherein,"Miltons Messiah is call'd Satan." In the latter story, the one who worksGod’s will for the spiritual evolution of mankind is the devil, who testsJob with trials and suffering for his ultimate betterment. In this contrastwe see that the workings of good and evil, and the will to higher beingare much more ambiguous than common sense can outline. Instead, there isa battle for the understanding, wherein "this history has been adoptedby both parties." In the falsely understood model, the usurping "Jehovahof the Bible being no other than he who dwells in flaming fire," the roleof the fallen one becomes heroic and Romantic. The traditional Satan beginsto play the role of the savior who "fell, &amp; formed a heaven of whathe stole from the Abyss," and "prays to the Father to send the comforteror Desire that Reason may have Ideas to build on." This interpretationis much more complex than that of traditional theology, for in it thereis a greater purpose in suffering and the Fall. In this model, Reason isfallen knowledge which needs the Holy Spirit of desire in order for itto imaginatively build back the fallen constitution of man and to restorecreative balance in the cosmos. Here desire is both the source and impetusof human growth, the cause and the redemption of suffering. Here thereis no eternal hell and damnation. Instead, the apotheosis of Christ, asfor all human beings, is in the restoration of the original order of theuniverse within the soul wherein, after death, Christ <i>becomes</i> Jehovah--notin the hell of the fallen state, but as a restored and reinvigorated creator.Blake criticizes his great predecessor on this count saying, "But in Miltonthe Father is Destiny, the Son, a Ratio of the five senses, &amp; the Holy-ghost,Vacuum!" Leaving out the redemptive role of the mythic figure of Satan(Messiah)--however passionately he writes of the story of Lucifer’s gloryand fall from Heaven in the opening books of Paradise Lost--Milton "wrotein fetters when he wrote of Angels &amp; God." Feeling that to write freelyabout the heavenly realm would have been to commit heresy, yet writingwith "liberty" about the role of the devil, Milton falls short of makingthe final link in the redemptive process. Milton is, however, "a true Poetand of the Devils party without knowing it." In speaking so of Milton,Blake acknowledges how close the poet comes to the truth, but also setsout his own agenda for bettering his predecessor. To be of the Devil’sparty is, in this sense, not to be "evil," but to be on the side of theactive forces of desire which work towards liberty and the rejustificationof the fallen state with that of the heavenly through the act of creation.Milton’s "Destiny," "ratio of the five senses," and "Vacuum" are, for Blake,sterile and static. For Blake destiny does not lie unachievably far offin the future. He presents no dead ratio of the senses, but a radical dynamicwithin and through them; no vacuum, for the space of the world is filledwith the burning fires of desire and the living imaginative will to liveas a growing and vividly creative process.</font><p><font face="Geneva"><u>PLATES 6 &amp; 7 -- A Memorable Fancy</u>:</font><p><font face="Geneva">In this plate, a prelude to the massive "Proverbsof Hell," we find what appears superficially to be a mere segue to whatfollows, but is actually one of the most revealing autobiographical statementsof Blake’s poetical mission. The poet clearly defines his position as beingwithin the "Devil’s camp," but in so doing also declares the uniquenessof his vision when compared to the conventional wisdom of "the presentworld," not to mention the vision of the angels and demons.</font><p><font face="Geneva">As the fancy commences we find the poet, "walkingamong the fires of hell, delighted with the enjoyments of Genius," whichenjoyments we can take as his own perceptions and imaginings. Blake immediatelydraws a distinction between this type of infernal consciousness and thatof the limited angels, which sees the mind amongst the flames of energyas "torment and insanity." This persona of Blake, of and among the devils’camp, proceeds to gather "their"--not the angels’, as it may falsely beconstrued--sayings of wisdom to better know the infernal side of being.</font><p><font face="Geneva">As he returns "home" -- to the complex dialogiccenter of being wherein mankind stands in between (at the marrying pointof) heavenly and hellish being--he encounters a vision of his own artisticmethod personified. This embodiment appears "on the abyss of the five senses,"hanging "over the present world" from a vertical cliff. So distinctly (andawkwardly) esconsced, the visionary artist is at once privileged and unnatural;yet, Blake seems to suggest, this state of differentiation and even monstrousnessis a kind of prerequisite. The poet is "a mighty Devil folded in blackclouds, hovering on the sides of the rock," and hangs outside of and abovethe normal world defined by the five senses. More properly, one shouldsay that this scenario represents the visionary’s relationship to the restof the human race after he has returned from his forays into the suprasensorial.We know that this is a figurative representation of Blake himself not onlythrough its ostentatious grandiosity, but also in that the demon employsBlake’s own technique of engraving his poems on metal plates: "with corrodingfires he wrote." When the text says, "he wrote the following sentence nowperceived by the minds of men, &amp; read by them on earth," we easilyperceive the implication that the saying which follows is perceived todaybecause it is first and finally written here, in the book which we arereading, by Blake himself.</font><p><font face="Geneva">That sentence, set in verse, is an invitation notonly into the following "Proverbs of Hell," but also into the greater visionaryuniverse:</font><p><font face="Geneva">How do you know but ev'ry Bird that cuts the airyway,</font><p><font face="Geneva">Is an immense world of delight, clos'd by your sensesfive?</font><p><font face="Geneva">If only our minds were not limited and closed withinthe senses we would see and experience through them the unbounded joysof the imaginative experience of the divine mentality, here seen--counter-symbolicto the previous demonic depictions--as a free-flying and unbound bird ofthe heavens. The point, though, is not that every bird is an immense worldof delight, but that we do not know that it is not ; and by seeing it assuch, or at least <i>believing</i> in the possibility that it is, we <i>make</i>it so. This, for Blake, is the ultimate form of faith.</font><p><font face="Geneva"><u>PLATES 7-10 -- The Proverbs of Hell</u>:</font><p><font face="Geneva">The Proverbs here brought forth from Hell may seemto be mere random gleanings rather than a strict construction of a "Bible"of the damned. Looked at closely, however, a connective principle can beseen running through the epigrams. Short of saying that there is a formalordering to the section--which would be an overstatement--it can at leastbe said that the manner in which the Proverbs are presented, with all oftheir exuberance and unconstrained blasphemy in the face of conventionalwisdom, is emblematic and <i>enactive</i> of the underlying dialogicaland subversive premises of the entire book. The central thematic hubs ofthe section are those of the concern for liberty versus tyranny, both inwardand outward; a demonstration of the evolutionary hierarchy of ideas, representedhere mainly through animal analogies; and a tacit development of the theoryof the imaginative which animates, enables and validates all that transpiresin these pages, which is the ultimate motive force and purpose of the aforementionedevolutionary and revolutionary impulses. This is by no means Blake’s attemptat formal philosophy; rather, it is a demonstration of its<i> overthrowing</i>by the eruptive force of poetic energy, a sometimes anti-logical intensitywhich is closer to the tense oppositions at the core of being. Blake’sphilosophy is a ritual destruction of the false god of Reason, later emblematizedas Urizen; and his activity of writing is allied with the infernal powerof Orc, forged on the poetic anvil of Los, that the world within man maybe made whole and fecund again through a reconstitution of the imaginativemind. The tyrannies of man upon man and of the mind upon the body, ultimatelyof the fallen and limited, material world upon the soul, will all thusbe obviated. It is in this sense that Blake intends his statement thatNature is barren without mankind.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Beneath and within all of the activity are the lines,"Truth can never be told so as to be understood, and not be believ'd,""What is now proved was once, only imagin'd," and "Every thing possibleto be believ'd is an image of truth." These are the epistemological gemsto be mined from Blake’s mountain of exuberant excess, the logical consequencesof his philosophy. Orbiting these core diamonds are the social and behavioralextensions, "The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom," "A foolsees not the same tree that a wise man sees," and "Exuberance is Beauty."From this axis we may find our way into the labyrinth of the Proverbs,and see the directedness which makes them cohere despite their apparentchaos.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Ontologically, these statements place our originand being in an as yet unfathomed creative process built into the mindof the Divine (which is <i>our </i>mind), and argue that this process inheresin us as an inalienable right and evolutionary duty. Blake, seeking a naturalistictheory of knowledge and art, comes to the seemingly obvious conclusionthat the impulses within us are <i>also</i> natural, and good; that theurges to express and love, to create and to grow are not the product ofthe fallen and degenerated world, but of a God within reality and the mindwhich interprets it. To follow positive exuberance could not possibly bewrong for Blake--in fact, the repression of it is tyranny for him. To riseto the top of humanity is not, for Blake to tyrannize others or to holddomination; rather it is to be at the consummate position of love and creativecompassion which is normally considered to have been achieved only by Jesus.Blake would have us all be Christs, to live a true Christianity which realizesitself in the love of existence and the activities of the imagination suchthat the being rightly using these would enter naturally into immortalityand unencumbered spirituality long before physical death. Art, thus, isthe door to paradise, preceded and aided by right and open perception,and loosely defined such that the art we speak of is the art of consciousness.For Blake the canvas upon which we realize our art is the mind itself.This brings us to the need to explain Blake’s theory of belief and itsrelation to truth.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Blake relates truth and reality within the mindand eye of the perceiver, thus taking literally the statement of Jesuswhich claims that faith can move mountains. His claims are not an advocacyof solipsism, but an attempt to give the power of creation to the one whoperceives, thus giving that person the ability to choose which of the myriadpossible realities s/he is going to accept. Belief, or faith convincinglyheld, is reality or truth for the holder of that belief; and Blake arguesthat we should choose the more comprehensive and magnanimous vision, whichwe may affirm to the very highest levels of paradisal being. This processof seeing may also work in reverse, obviously, generating all of the "mind-forg’dmanacles" of self-damning limitation which Blake rails so vehemently againstin the Proverbs. In this sense, Blake uses "truth" more in terms of "honesty"than to imply a teleological and totalizing, absolute end. His vision ofthe absolute is, as we have said, an unending process.</font><p><font face="Geneva">What differs in Blake’s view from that of pure relativismis that he is always focused upon the sublime, either beauteous or horrific--infact, there is little real distinction. His relativism is positive, andinvolves<i> relation</i>. He is interested in a (r)evolutionary impulsewhich incorporates both ends of the sublime spectrum--it is all wonder.His love of the miraculous leads him to the idea that there are thingsnot yet proven or understood, which are nonetheless actual and true. Oursciences of the imagination have just not yet encompassed them. Relatedto this is the concept that everything possible of belief is an image oftruth: all that we are capable of conceiving or perceiving is somehow truein that it is a partial and participatory view of the entire organic realityof the universe. No perception nor experience of the mind could possiblybe outside of the universe; therefore it is an imaging, an imaginativeabstraction of reality without being separate from it. But there is moreto Blake’s conception of perception; he implies further that since we arethus part of the universe, and since the universe is never finalized, thenin a real way we are all its continuous creators. Hence, we come to thesubtly different statement, "Truth can never be told so as to be understood,and not be believ'd." If truth is told with the convincing ardor and poeticgenius necessary to be understood in the fullest sense, then it is convincing.It imparts the vision of the teller directly to the listener as in thearts of painting and poetry. If the "truth" of one person’s vision is understoodby another it becomes the truth for that other; and in a figurative senseat least, for all of the world. The truth is in the creative telling, inthe perception and communication of it, not so much in the objective discoveryof it. This social, humanistic view is directly opposed to the scientificrationalism and mechanistic empiricism of Newton, Locke, and even of Rousseau.For Blake, these and other figures of his age "mock" visionary realityin that they see <i>with</i> the eye, in a constrained way, not throughit. They do not understand that exuberance is beauty. It is in this sensethat a fool sees a different "tree" than a wise man--the fool has not reallyopened his or her eyes, or cannot really extend the perceptive facultiesbeyond the limits of the senses. The "wise" person understands that "excess,"or exuberance, both of the body and the imagination, leads to the wisdomof seeing the larger aspect of all that is seen. The wise and the visionarysee the infinite in all things, as infinite potential and endless interaction,regeneration and transmutative creativity. Only a fool or a slave wouldlive inside an eggshell. Our highest functioning is to create, though perhapsfrom a fallen or inevitably limited state, for "Eternity is in love withthe productions of time."</font><p><font face="Geneva">The Proverbs begin with a naturalistic constructionafter Ecclesiastes which provides a starting metaphoric contextualizationwhere everything has its proper time and place, especially in the humanlife cycle: "In seed time learn, in harvest teach, in winter enjoy." Thismay seem to be teleologically determining, but Blake intends to demonstratethat it is not the organic realm of generation and death that is the enemyof man; rather, it is the obstructions imposed by man on others or by theindividual upon itself which are the true enemy. Nature is benign, andis the source of the energy which Blake seeks quickly to turn towards thehuman enemies of freedom. He praises excess short of inordinate pride,slaughters prudence as an old hag and, in the style of the Old Testamentprophets, brings pestilence down upon those who are incapable of followingthe healthy desire which builds the world of natural and spiritual freedom.To live within repression and limitation is to live in what Blake terms"folly." For those buried in this hopeless folly, all is bound within time,within "weight and measure;" but one who is "wise" is free to experiencethe timelessness of infinite creative experience, of flying "with his ownwings" of imaginative sensitivity and openness.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Sorrow and joy both have their place in the openmind and heart of experience; and pride, lust, wrath and nakedness areextremities which are beautiful and expansive. In that these are passionateand undeniable expressions of life and passion, they are good; and in thatthey are exuberant and free they are "portions of eternity too great forthe eye of man"--too great, that is, to ever be <i>finally</i> understoodand defined. Such an expression is prophetic poetry, as well: one whichresounds into an aesthetic eternity. Bu that which contains contrasts withthat which releases energy: "The cistern contains; the fountain overflows."Through the latter modality, "One thought, fills immensity," and createsa universe based upon the truths it contains. "The eagle never lost somuch time, as when he submitted to learn of the crow;" and man must, forBlake, be the loftiness and power which the eagle represents, surely notthe furtive, scavenging everyday man. In these terms, Blake argues fora destiny which is transcendental, absolutely not a mystical denial.</font><p><font face="Geneva">The only thing which approaches the mystic is "prayer,"which we may assume, pursuant upon the theory of consciousness, beliefand perception which we have outlined above, is consubstantial with thecreative process present in the poetic/prophetic art. As Blake has thedenizens of Hell say, " As the plow follows words, so God rewards prayers."The consequences of this kind of creation follow as naturally as the produceof farming set into growth by the horse-drawn plow. But for Blake, it isbetter to surpass the methodical, to enact the energies of genius: "Thetygers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction." This instructionis the way of the limited world and the mind which defines it as such,full of prudence and restraint. (However, the image--figure 6--at the endof the Proverbs illustrates this with duplicitous</font><p><font face="Geneva">irony, showing scribes such as Blake here in Helllearning methodically from a wrathful fallen angel!) Though we learn fromsuch ways and, " If others had not been foolish, we should be so," still"The soul of sweet delight, can never be defil'd." We should be able tolive beyond, but mindfully of, these lessons. Blake would have us liveas incarnations of the universal elements, like great giants: "The eyesof fire, the nostrils of air, the mouth of water, the beard of earth."Moving from the eagle, which is "a portion of Genius," and the figurativemodel of the higher mind which creates, Blake compares the limiting priestsof religion with the unmetamorphosed caterpillar, blighting the "fairestjoys" with their repressions. The poet of vision would rather adhere tothe naturalness of beauty saying, "To create a little flower is the labourof ages," rather than give in to the artificiality of limiting theologies--"Damn,braces: Bless relaxes."</font><p><font face="Geneva">But all mad ravings must have an end, even theseProverbs. Around the final restatements, "The head Sublime, the heart Pathos,the genitals Beauty, the hands &amp; feet Proportion," and "Exuberanceis Beauty," there is a bitter and contradictory tone which enters the lastplate. The dialogic impulse spins toward dissipation as the opposing statementsseem to cancel each other out. "Crooked roads" and the murdering of infantsare advocated. Nature is said to be barren without man, which contradicts(aside from the sense we have outlined above in which the creativity ofmankind is distinguished from organic generation) the earlier emphasisin the Proverbs upon the necessity, fecundity and beauty of the naturalas opposed to the artificially human. Black crows and white owls are foreverset in opposition in their solipsisms. It becomes obvious, with this increasinglyrambling quality found in the last lines, that the denizens of Hell havehad their say. The last voice to speak in this section is that of the personaof Blake, who finally stops reporting and puts a stop to the section beforeit may roll out of all control: "Enough! or Too much!" Despite the needfor excess, there is also a need for proportion--especially in art. Itis time to move onward through the abyss.</font><p><font face="Geneva"><u>PLATE 11</u>:</font><p><font face="Geneva">Emerging, like Dante from the caverns of Hell, welook out at the top of this plate (figure 7) through the opening of a caveinto the natural world of the human past. Perhaps just after the Fall,the forms of Nature are anthropomorphized, or human forms are melding withthe natural world as if to imply that no separation exists as yet. At thecenter we find a mother and child, suggesting innocence. Here Blake firmlysets the beginning of human knowledge in the works of the ancient Poetswho, while still bound in the realm of generation, yet saw the fundamentalconnnectedness of things as natural manifestations of an objectified andprojected Divine Mind. This plate, then, tells of man’s second Fall--</font><p><font face="Geneva">the falling into mental abstraction and the ideathat there is a separation between body and soul, mind and nature.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Much like Blake does, these ancient Poets "animatedall sensible objects with Gods of Geniuses, calling them by the names andadorning them with the properties of woods, rivers, mountains, lakes, cities,nations, and whatever their enlarged &amp; numerous senses could perceive."They are his prophetic predecessors; but what they lack is the enemy whichBlake has so readily at hand dialogically to play upon. This plate treatsthe fall of religion into the hands of a tyrannical class of usurpers,the hierarchically organized, professional priests. A "system" was formed,the anecdote recounts (and it is this system against which Blake must formhis own lest he be enslaved), by a priesthood bent upon taking advantageof the "vulgar" unenlightened, to steal them away from their connectionto the earth and somatic awareness by "attempting to realize or abstractthe mental deities from their objects." Thus the visionary poets were pushedaside by usurpers, and their myths and legends used as parables in supportof this false religion.</font><p><font face="Geneva">A false god or gods created from this abstractedamalgamation was then raised up in the unnatural image of the "wise," bearded,priest-like figure we see floating in the skies at the bottom of the plate.From him floats a sleeping, naked man, lost, for he has "forgot that Alldeities reside in the human breast." This is the fundamental loss or robberyof human history, the loss of the subjective and creative nature of divineperception. For Blake, it is ample reason for righteous wrath and propheticindignation.</font><p><font face="Geneva"><u>PLATES 12-14--A Memorable Fancy</u>:</font><p><font face="Geneva">After its great diatribe against priesthood andthe religion which oppresses vision, the book moves on to a section whichseeks to affirm and define the nature of the visionary activity of prophecy.Meeting with his allies Ezekiel and Isaiah, modern versions of the ancientPoets who founded religion (properly) upon nature and the opened senses,Blake anticipates the accusations of heresy that will come to him uponthe publication of this book. He seeks to enact an end run around the despiteof his conventional Christian neighbors and authorities by at once statinga new theology rooted in a time and orientation before the era of Christianpower, allied and alloyed with the Old Testament Judaic prophets, as wellas defining the unique nature of his own personal futuristic vision andexperience of revelatory creativity.</font><p><font face="Geneva">He asks his dinner partners, the two prophets, howthey could have been so bold in their declarations of revelation; and inso doing shows his cogniscence of the knee-jerk denigration he himselfis sure to receive. What follows is really Blake’s self-justification beforethis inevitability. Isaiah answers this questioning first saying,</font><p><font face="Geneva">I saw no God, nor heard any, in a finite organicalperception;</font><p><font face="Geneva">but my senses discover'd the infinite in every thing,and as I</font><p><font face="Geneva">was then perswaded, &amp; remain confirm'd; thatthe voice of</font><p><font face="Geneva">honest indignation is the voice of God, I carednot for conse-</font><p><font face="Geneva">quences but wrote.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Taken as Blake’s own words, this is far from a publicretraction in fear of reprisal, but a confident and mature statement ofphilosophical purpose. Here we find Blake reassuring the reader and hispublic that he does not take his experience as a literal, objective fact,but rather one of a subjective dispelling of the illusion of externalityand limitation. Not with the organic, physical senses does the poet see,but <i>through</i> them with the power of internal inspiration. Lookingin such a way, the mind sees the hidden realities of the universe, andmakes meanings of them which correspond to the reality within the soulor mind. Freed of the manacles of finitude, the mind may thus see realbeing. Seeing so, fears of mis-understanding and reprisal give way to pureconviction and the "honest indignation" of those who have seen beyond theprison of convention. This attitude goes beyond mere belief and entersthe realm of faith as the prophet replies, with echoes of the words ofJesus, to Blake’s query as to whether firm persuasion makes a thing so:"All poets believe that it does, &amp; in ages of imagination this firmperswasion removed mountains; but many are not capable of a firm perswasionof any thing." Once again, the prisoners of conventional consciousnessare contrasted with those who have the type of vision which was lost inthe course of the Fall and is necessary for future social and spiritualgrowth.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Ezekiel states that what Blake calls the PoeticGenius was in fact the first principle of the ancient Israelites in theirown terms of definition, and that it was believed that all religions andreligious impulses sprang from this source. Whether or not this may betaken as an historical fact, Blake’s interpretation seems to refer notto the personal divinity of some Jehovah figure, but rather to the spiritualforce and consolation that dwells within infinity, the God which Davidcalls to in the Psalms. Couching the argument thus in nationalistic terms,Blake begins to set up England--by association and since it is the homeof the poet-instigator (Blake) of the purgatorial new hell--as the sitefor the New Jerusalem of the future. Despite the derogation inevitablyreceived by one such as Blake who figuratively "eat dung [sic], &amp; layso long on his right &amp; left side" in "the desire of raising other meninto a perception of the infinite," the prophet asks, "is he honest whoresists his genius or conscience only for the sake of present ease or gratification?"Again, Blake is arguing <i>through</i> the prophets for freedoms, of expressionand vision, in the face of stultifying convention.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Blake himself then concludes the section with aprophecy of the future, a restatement of his principles of sensual primacyand per-fectibility, and a yet more clear figurative depiction of his ownunique</font><p><font face="Geneva">methods of engraving his works:</font><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<p><font face="Geneva">The ancient tradition that the world will be consumedin fire at</font><p><font face="Geneva">the end of six thousand years is true, as I haveheard from Hell.</font><p><font face="Geneva">For the cherub with his flaming sword is herebycommanded to leave his guard at tree of life, and when he does, the wholecreation will be consumed, and appear infinite, and holy whereas it nowappears finite &amp; corrupt. This will come to pass by an improvementof sensual enjoyment. But first the notion that man has a body distinctfrom his soul, is to be expunged: this I shall do, by printing in the infernalmethod, by corrosives, which in Hell are salutary and medicinal, meltingapparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid.</font><p><font face="Geneva">This is a definition of a way, a truth and a light.The fact that the angel has left off its guard of the tree of life is--howeverfull of doom and possible dreadful, apocalyptic consequences--a true opportunityto reach the real holy grail of unlimited being and consciousness. It isa time for which mankind must be ready; and Blake sees his work as instrumentalin this urgent preparation. The illustration at the top of the plate (fig.8) illustrates such a flaming cherub, covering and obscuring, yet energeticallyseeking to awaken the deadened sensory and sensual body of prone mankind.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Starting from the basics, Blake seeks to demonstratethe philosophical soundness of the concept of the improvement of sensualbeing, not to promote decadence of the senses but for there to be a realityand honest basis to what follows. In recognizing the body’s reality andthrough improving the perceptive faculties, the soul may indwell, may becomeactive within the self. This activation and restoration of the full bodyof man is liberation and right perception. Through these steps, Blake argues,we may ultimately achieve the reality which he perceives in vision andstates beautifully thus: "If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is, infinite. For man has closed himselfup, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern." These chinksare the narrowed inlets of the self-limited sensory perception, facultieswhich ought to be the doors to infinitude. The doors may naturally be openedeither way, opening into an enclosed space defining the universe as limited,or outward to enter an uncontained world seen through the awakened senses.Hence, Blake’s enemy is not the Church or its priests so much as it islimiting and imprisoning <i>ideas</i>.</font><p><font face="Geneva"><u>PLATE 15--A Memorable Fancy</u>:</font><p><font face="Geneva">From the prophetic mood of the preceding page, wenow progress into a completely symbolic and apocalyptic idiom, almost anadapted pastiche of Revelations. Here, however, we are not concerned withthe end of the world so much as the ontology of knowledge and technology,and their relation to the fallen state of humanity. Impossible to pin downabsolutely, the allegory here is easy enough at least to contextualizewithin Blake’s system. It is open and elusive, as all prophetic art mustbe, to induce a state of receptivity and expansion in the reader/listener.The sense of foreboding and sublimnity works within the symbolism withenergy, moving through but uncontained by words and imagery.</font><p><font face="Geneva">The initial context of the printing press immediatelyalludes to the engraving and printing work of Blake himself; and so weknow that the whole allegory refers in some primary way to the transformativeaffect of art upon consciousness. Yet, in the fact that the process describedis one of a transmission of knowledge down through the generations, weare dealing with something learned rather than real experience and vision.The process descends into a cave of increasing abstraction from the worldoutside, and yet it is couched in an alchemical terminology of refinement.Experience, then, is at once being perfected and limited. At the deepestlevels of the cave, taken literally, we find the enclosed and compartmentalizedforms of knowledge in the shapes of books; but figuratively, this is aprocess of evolutionary transformation of matter and experience towardsa core from whence the mind may return to vision through transcendent cognition.Thus understood, the Fall into limitation, enclosure and matter is a positiveopportunity. For Blake, transmutation matters more than transmission. Knowledgetaken from tradition can never be as affective towards this end as a directvisionary experience, which <i>alters</i> the eye which sees.</font><p><font face="Geneva">In the first of the six progressively evolving chamberswe witness a "Dragon-Man," whom we may take to be a primordial form ofman still wedded to the scaly forms of life bound to the unenlightenedelements, barely emerged from the demiurgic, creative sources in the seasat the bottom of the Fall into unconsciousness. His role is merely to sweepoff the rubbish which accrues as a result of what happens down the temporalline, or to prepare the evolutionary way. It must be remembered, however,that this process cannot be seen as linear or teleologically temporal.This very entranceway must also be the point of conscious birth into thecosmos, of the coming out through the womb of the senses--just as sexualenergies lead eventually to the physical birth of a new human being.</font><p><font face="Geneva">In the second chamber we move from mere stones toa recognition of the raw but precious gems and metals of the earth, toa nascent knowledge of the purposes to which they may be put. The overseerof this point is a snake, reminiscent of the serpentine Lucifer of Eden,a subtler and more refined version of the initial reptilian man.</font><p><font face="Geneva">The third chamber introduces a new element, withan eagle made up entirely of air, refined nearly to non-physical being.This new repre-sentative is the polar extreme of the serpent precedingit, and yet is to be wedded to it in the image at the bottom of the plate(fig. 9). This relation of opposites once again emphasizes the non-linearevolution of this page, and reiterates the dialogic premises of Blake’sentire work. The eagle represents the aetherial end of the evolutionarydyad, causing the cave to appear as if infinite in its <i>interior</i>.This bird is nothing, however, without</font><p><font face="Geneva">a grounding in the earthly elements; and the eagle’sattendant eagle-men display this as they take the elemental, "reptilian"methods of their predecessors to build what may be taken as the preliminaryforms of the eventually realizable New Jerusalem of re-incorporated humanity.</font><p><font face="Geneva">In the fourth chamber we encounter the fiery elementallions of inspiration and infernal passion, without whom there could beno synthesis nor alchemical reaction between the other elements. Throughthe energetic raging of these figurative lions within the human psyche/body,the earth and air are used to transform what has preceded this stage into"living fluids," or heated and pourable metals of the imagination. Thesefluids are taken by "Unnam'd forms"--perhaps hidden forces or parametersof growth in the universe or psyche, or perhaps some kind of aiding seraphim--and"cast" into the infinitely inwardly opened, inside-out, fallen universe.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Within this apparently open world, proper and contemporary"Men" are able to make what they think are objective observations and toput their results and technologies into books. These libraries of cultureare, however, intrinsically limited in that they are produced with knowledgegleaned from a fallen and inverted cosmos of consciousness; hence, theymust be surpassed. Mankind must learn, then, to see through the "chinks"of the books’ leaves and to take themselves with their knowledge back outinto the surface world where the true potentialities of things may be seen.Of course, this seems similar to Plato’s cave allegory; but the differencehere is that Blake’s allegory is cyclic, non-hierarchical, transtemporal,reflexive and not fundamentally predetermining. Plato posits that the "forms"exist outside of mankind and are absolute and predetermined. Blake stipulatesthat all that is preconfigured are the elements and the exigencies of workingwith them in the fallen context. This is as far as he goes towards positinga "Law," one at the base of life leaving the "top" end open.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Once transmitted knowledge and hoary traditionsare surpassed by vision at the core of the cave in the fallen mind, thenthe senses and the cave itself open from within to reveal the magnitudeand possibilities of the imagination. Blake, unlike Plato, does not arguethat the chambers depicted here are illusions to be replaced or dispelledin favor of some more transcendent reality, but rather seeks to show howall of these levels are interdependent and relative. They<i> relate</i>and are mutually dependent. Heaven cannot exist without Hell, nor can therebe any progress to the most comprehensive states of being and creationwithout their recognition and transmutative union within the individual.Although this is figuratively a chemical reaction, it must be rememberedthat at the core of things at the molecular level there are atoms whichever and always remain dyadically tense with the opposition which is truefriendship and the energy of all that lives and is. Without such tension,be it between an Orc or a Urizen, or protons and electrons, there wouldbe no existence or change. Nothing is permanently lost or replaced in thisprogression if there is no soul separate from the body, no body distinctfrom the soul. Mankind, then, must retake the "living fluids" of the formsof imagination and realize that we are the shapers of our own reality,whether in art, writing or in visions.</font><p><font face="Geneva"><u>PLATES 16 &amp; 17</u>:</font><p><font face="Geneva">The elemental forces of the previous fancy are interpretedin the present section as, "The Giants who formed this world into its sensualexistence and now seem to live in it in chains," who "are in truth, thecauses of its life &amp; the sources of all activity." Once again, in apresentation of the world as a constrained tension of energy working withinordering systems, we see a demiurgos which can never be truly restrainedbecause it is the motive force of all being and of the dynamics of thehuman psyche. These "Giants" only "seem" to be chained, for they actuallymove all established orders, and they eventually overturn structures anddefinitions as surely as they create them. Blake uses this context to establishonce again just whom his enemy is saying, "but the chains are, the cunningof weak and tame minds, which have power to resist energy." Revolutionaryenergy (Orc) cannot be contained, and those who (like Urizen, or any humantyrant) build shallow orders upon the limitedly-defined earth simply donot understand the wild and un-predictable, yet cyclic processes of being.True power, as opposed to tyranny, works creatively with this energy ratherthan resisting or repressing it. It is folly to resist the immensity ofan elemental, "giant" force--especially in its form as psychological metaphor--suchas fire, earth, air or water.</font><p><font face="Geneva">These giants may also be interpreted through theimage which covers the top edge of the plate (figure 11), depicting anold man and four smaller figures huddled together in a closed, prison-likecell. The "father" figure may be taken as representing the mental or optical,"visionary" aspect of mankind, and the others (as Erdman suggests) as theremaining four physical senses. Thus we may take this illustration as showing"what happens if the collaborators of Plate 15 separate, if cunning priestsimpose their errors of abstraction: our senses sit in prison not palaces"(Erdman 113). Taking the image as a representation of the story, popularizedby Dante, of Ugolino and his sons who were imprisoned and starved to thepoint of cannibalism, we may see the kind of repression through abstractionwhich Blake opposes as a hellish state wherein the senses of the body consumeand violate the body rather than opening it to the cosmos and to the forcesof the earthly levels of being. We must, then, always remember that thereis no body separate from the soul, leaving the senses open to a creative"spiritual" dimension.</font><p><font face="Geneva">On a more social level, Blake distinguishes betweenwhat he terms the "prolific" and the "devourer," one being the creativetype of individual while the other is the orderer, organizer and controllerof those which <i>may</i> be controlled:</font><p><font face="Geneva">Thus one portion of being, is the Prolific, theother, the</font><p><font face="Geneva">Devouring: to the devourer it seems as if the producerwas in</font><p><font face="Geneva">his chains, but it is not so; he only takes portionsof existence</font><p><font face="Geneva">and fancies that the whole.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Just as the priest fancies that he controls realitywith his mythology and theology, and that he orders the cosmos towardsthe eschaton and heaven --so seemingly avoiding the gigantic forces ofthe elements and mortality itself--so the devouring type believes itselfthe master of what it organizes and manages. Actually, the Prolific ismuch closer to the "giant" forces which roil in the sublime abysses ofthe imagination dwelling, figuratively, in the skies and deep within theearth. The artist or <i>maker</i> of things, the creative thinker of ideasand seer of forms, is therefore much more powerful and alive than the mereorganizer. The artist, under these parameters, is always a revolutionary(Orc) in the eyes of the threatened controllers (Urizen), and must be suppressedby them to retain limited order.</font><p><font face="Geneva">These microcosmic, self-defining and limiting ordersare what Blake calls here the "portions" of existence mistakenly takenfor the whole. The error in this type of awareness is in the assumptionthat reality can be finally and adequately ordered and defined by limitedand ordinary human means. The prolific artist knows that the contrary istrue, that the universe proliferates absolutely and constantly a myriadof realities, of seemingly conflicting (but dialogic) "truths." Despiteall of this, however, the opposing ends of being <i>need</i> one anotherto come into being, just as eternity needs time and spirit needs matter:"But the Prolific would cease to be Prolific unless the Devourer as a seareceived the excess of his delights." There must be tension between theopposite poles of being, whether as in the atom or in Blake’s cosmic dramafor, " to reconcile them seeks to destroy existence." Without mutual reflectionand thus recognition here, without an axis, there can be no <i>structure</i>for being. This makes the polarities "enemies;" but it is also a form ofco-operative "friendship" in opposition. As Einstein posited, there isno metaphysical aether underlying being, just the interaction of gravitationand energy that constitutes being.</font><p><font face="Geneva">To conclude this section, Blake more specificallyaddresses religion, responding to the hypothetical accusation of excessiveand heretical pride in the art he advocates. He replies that, "God onlyActs &amp; Is, in existing beings or Men," or that the divine can <i>never</i>be unmanifest, but must be incarnate to exist and know itself. Once again,the universe is barren without the dialogue produced by consciousness workingcreatively within limitation, or semi-consciously through all beings whoseexistence is a manifestation of energy and fecundity of natural impulse.False religion seeks to deny these facts and to assert that all being comesfrom a detached abstraction of its own casuistic reasoning. This is notthe religion of Jesus Christ, as Blake goes to great lengths to stressin the rest of the book. He recalls here to the questioner that Jesus himselfsays in the New Testament that he, "came not to send Peace but a Sword,"to divide and to judge not in the comfortable terms of human prudence,but in the name of the eternally Prolific energy of being. This Jesus isnot only the beneficent shepherd, but is all the forces of being or divinitywhich incur upon the human domain, whether they be "Messiah or Satan orTempter," or that which "was formerly thought to be one of the Antediluvianswho are our Energies." This version of the divine is not comforting, andoffers none of the easy or final answers which humanity so ardently desiresor dreams up in its wishful thinking and religion; rather, it manifestswithin the constrained dimension of the true power of being and, hence,of the potentialities of the human imagination.</font><p><font face="Geneva"><u>PLATES 17-20--A Memorable Fancy</u>:</font><p><font face="Geneva">This section, the longest and most fantastic ofthe book, is arguably its climax and summation, a bold statement of Blake’sopposition to limiting theology and analytic repression of natural impulse.In it Blake’s character directly confronts an angel in a visionary challenge,both gazing into the abyss of fear until one of them snaps. Blake usesthe parameters and definitions of Christian church theology against itself,debunking its self-generated Heaven and Hell by contrasting these withhis own vision of a pure and innocent earthly life which is the sole sourceof healthy, unabstracted life for humanity. Using the classic methodologyof debate, Blake uses his opponent’s own logical and metaphysical fallaciesto dispel the common errors of religion, and then asserts his alternative.</font><p><font face="Geneva">As another proactive defense against accusationsof religious heresy, Blake has the angel attempt to reveal to him the damnationsinevitable for him if he accepts conventional theology while continuingin his prophetic course of revolution. Blake accepts the angel’s offeras a challenge for mutual objective consideration, not as a valid fearof hell. And so they proceed through a worldly stable and into a church,down through the center of organized and dogmatic religion to its gutsin the tomblike vaults, finally down to the "mill" of analytic dogma andout into an internal cosmos under the earth. The way is "tedious" for Blake,but he continues if only for the sake of the enjoyment of argument andsuper-fluous "opposition." Here, hanging out over the abyss from subterraneanroots and mushrooms, they contemplate the wholly illusory hell createdby and within the angel’s conventional theology.</font><p><font face="Geneva">The view is as if from space, with a "nether" skybelow them to which Blake suggest they "commit" themselves. Echoing theBible, where it is said that we should not tempt the grace of God in faith,the angel proves itself a somewhat unworthy opponent already saying, "donot presume O young-man." What follows is a twisted vision of horror inthe abyss, but Blake calmly asks the angel what, then, his eternal lotis to be. The angel responds that he will stand "between the white andblack spiders" which dialectically weave the warp and woof of reality--implying that Blake’s place is only a futile one between unsynthesizedopposites in this lower world. Finally, conjured out of the worst fearsof the conventional mind, the serpentine Leviathan (fig. 12), sea-beastof the fallen and watery realms of the unconscious, arises from torridstorms and fiery skies. It is so real that it is said to have all of the"fury of a spiritual existence;" and it frightens the angel back into thesafety of the mill. Blake, however--accustomed to horrors and visions--remainsin contemplation, unafraid of that which can never threaten him unlesshe believes in its existence.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Without the angel to project a falsely speculatedvision of reality, the scene changes and Blake sees into the unpollutedheart of nature and mankind’s relation to it:</font><p><font face="Geneva">I remain'd alone, &amp; then this appearance wasno more, but I</font><p><font face="Geneva">found myself sitting on a pleasant bank beside ariver by</font><p><font face="Geneva">moonlight hearing a harper who sung to the harp,&amp; his theme</font><p><font face="Geneva">was, The man who never alters his opinion is likestanding</font><p><font face="Geneva">water, &amp; breeds reptiles of the mind.</font><p><font face="Geneva">This simple, pure and pastoral vision, so reminiscentof the <u>Songs of Innocence</u>, is an astounding contrast to the horridconjuries of the supposedly heavenly angel. The angel is surprised thatBlake has escaped, so used as it is to the mass of men falling for thistrap of psychological horror usually so affective in inducing conversion.Blake, however, so rooted as he is in his faith in natural impulse andthe holiness of the world as it is, is not taken in. Indeed, those of fixedopinion such as the angel trapped in religious vision or the priest whoonly sees through the book, can never grow in experience and philosophyas does the one such as Blake, open to the wild dialogism of being. Theperversion of the stagnant mind can only breed the monstrosity of sucha thing as the Leviathan, and cannot see it as Blake does, as at leastone more element in the interplay of possibilities. Blake sees the dragon,but sees through it also; and he is able to encounter the real startingpoint of experience, which is the simple riverside of nature within time,unpretentious and uncorrupted, beautiful, tranquil and sensual. From thisstarting point of realization and recognition, real advances may be madewhich do not preclude the body, the earth and all of its wondrousness asdoes prohibitive religion. Blake answers the angel’s question explaining,"All that we saw was owing to your metaphysics."</font><p><font face="Geneva">Having thus called the angel’s bluff, Blake counterswith a challenge: to show the angel <i>its</i> eternal lot. Taking flightbeyond the earth, Blake forces the reluctant angel through the purificationof proximity to the sun itself and then, with the works of Swedenborg inhand as examples of limited vision, proceeds out the end of the Ptolemaicsolar system between Saturn and the fixed stars. Here the angel may seethe voidness and abstracted worthlessness of its cosmology and theology.This angelic heaven is so void of meaning and substance that Blake saysit is "space, if space it may be call'd."</font><p><font face="Geneva">This vision is dispelled as quickly as it is revealedas empty of true quality, and the two find themselves back at the originalscenario of the section, where they enter the church and proceed directlyto the Bible at the altar. Here Blake has taken over authority completelyand, using the Bible for his own prophetic ends, he reveals to the angelthe emptiness of its reading of the scriptures: "lo! it was a deep pit,into which I descended driving the Angel before me." Now the Bible hasbecome the angel’s enemy rather than its seductive tool of coercive ideologyand blinding faith. What they find within this interpretation of the Bibleis a horrid representation of the analytically-based casuistry of limitingtheology of the nature of Aquinas’. They find seven bricked in buildingsrather more like prison cells that the seven heavens theology would haveus believe it offers. In one of these the two find hordes of monkeys, symbolicof the debased impulses of humanity, copulating and fetishizing, then devouringone another in a sadistic-cannibalistic orgy. This is Blake’s representationof the course and actuality of human history and culture under the guidanceof a theology which would rather subdivide and conquer than live creativelyin contact with actuality. They emerge from this hellish vision of flawedreligion, and Blake now carries in his hand not the works of Swedenborgbut their fleshless origins, "the skeleton of a body, which in the millwas Aristotles Analytics."</font><p><font face="Geneva">The angel, defensive and taken aback, can only shelteritself in petty righteousness at having been so affronted by the truthof itself and its false quasi-divinity. It accuses Blake of "imposing"with his hyper-real "phantasy;" but Blake is not ashamed. Rather, he pointsout that they have merely exposed each other to the other’s vision of reality.This mutuality the angel cannot comprehend, so used as it is to being onthe dispensing end of truths. Blake concludes that it is a mere waste oftime to attempt dialogue with this dogmatic moralist who cannot understandthe richness and complexity of a metaphysics based upon the opened imaginationand senses, wherein "Opposition is true Friendship," and reality is generatedthrough interdependent visions within a synergetically relativistic universeof the mind.</font><p><font face="Geneva"><u>PLATES 21-22</u>:</font><p><font face="Geneva">This section and plate commence with an image whichdiffers radically with that which ends the previous one--a naked man (fig12),</font><p><font face="Geneva">symbolic of rebirth and/or prelapsarian innocence,sits on a hilltop under a dawn sky, looking upward as if surprised by epiphany.As Erdman points out (118), there is a skull beneath the figure’s kneeand an empty sheet of paper under his opposite hand, symbolic, respectively,of the "dead thought" and the "Analytics" which the Blake of the previoussection has just escaped from and disproven. The image is spacious andlight, as opposed to the cramped and darkened scene of the preceding Leviathan,giving at once a breath of the liberation to come as well as a thematicintroduction to the section. The writings of one such as Swedenborg cannever be more than a "candle in sunshine" compared to the psychologicaldawn which this figure beholds; but they can be an encumbrance to visionif mistaken for ends in themselves.</font><p><font face="Geneva">In this section of the book Blake seeks to displaythe limitations of a monological perspective, using the angels (as withthe one in the pre-ceding section) as examples of limited thought whichencloses rather than freeing the mind. His great adversary here, however,is Swedenborg. His is a formative influence upon Blake; indeed, one soclose to Blake’s own vision that the minute differences between the twoneed to be exag-gerated in explication such that they become dialogic,lest there be any confusion of the two. In Blake’s view, similarity isan "enemy" in that it tends to break down the dialogue between oppositeswhich, as we have seen, is so necessary to the expansive dynamism of propheticcreativity.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Juxtaposed here with such visionary activity isthe system-building tendency of thought so common to formal philosophyand religion, and especially characteristic of the Enlightenment milieuof Blake’s earlier, pre-Revolutionary life. The Church, Locke and especiallySwedenborg emerge as limiting thinkers of the tendency to "systematic reasoning"which Blake declares to be the source of the vanity of the angels. WhenBlake states in this context that the entire oeuvre of Swedenborg is onlythe "Contents or Index of already publish’d books" he is declaring thatreasoning is only the outline, not the substance of visionary perception,that it cannot substitute for the real thing. It can, in fact, be thatwhich, because it is so related to the goal, be it religious or philosophical,is the greatest blind to the thing in itself. This is why apparent alliesbecome enemies; and yet it is why Heaven and Hell need one another formutual revelation. Blake realizes this, but knows also that he may neverrelinquish his oppositional guard at the doors of perception. He has tostand with the mad prophets, to make his own system as he goes, lest hefall into a personal dogma or that of a system created to limit experience.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Blake is proud, but he is not the snob who wouldjudge himself as lofty only because he has defined the world as limitedand set up the parameters of reality in his favor. Blake’s oppositionalstance is not one which requires derogation of another, but rather seeksto be mutually enriching for apparent enemies in discourse. He characterizesthe philosophical and moral folly of righteousness in his enemies (i.e.,those who are incapable of comprehending the dialogical exigencies of existence)as such:</font><p><font face="Geneva">A man carried a monkey about for a shew, &amp; becausehe was a</font><p><font face="Geneva">little wiser than the monkey, grew vain, and conciev'dhimself</font><p><font face="Geneva">as much wiser than seven men. It is so with Swedenborg;he</font><p><font face="Geneva">shews the folly of churches &amp; exposes hypocrites,till he</font><p><font face="Geneva">imagines that all are religious, &amp; himself thesingle one on</font><p><font face="Geneva">earth that ever broke a net.</font><p><font face="Geneva">As we saw in the previous scenario wherein the monkeysof analytical subdivision gnaw each other to bits in the process of mutuallimitation, so here the monkey is used to represent the "lower" naturewhich functions as a common denominator in all encapsulating systems ofthought. The point is that the man in this story is only "a little wiser"than the monkey, just as Swedenborg was only slightly more progressivethan the Church of his day. Blake seeks to go further than these extremes.He does not want merely to be one who "broke a net," but the one who breaks<i>all</i> nets. Swedenborg perhaps came close, but because he did not recognizethe next obvious steps to freedom of the mind and body, his truths havesadly become "all the old falsehoods."</font><p><font face="Geneva">This error in conception is due to a lack of comprehensionof the dialogic nature of the psyche and reality, due to a repressive tendencytoward transcendental repression rather than visionary synergy. Swedenborgand his ilk make the fundamental error of allowing their visionary tendenciesto be regulated by and transformed by philistinism, thus becoming whatthey ostensibly opposed. This is why Blake always sides with rogue prophetslike Ezekiel and Isaiah, those who reject conventionality and comfortsof the mind in favor of raw truth which is incapable of encapsulating,final comprehension. Hence, Swedenborg is said to have "...conversed withAngels who are all religious, &amp; conversed not with Devils who all hatereligion, for he was incapable thro' his conceited notions." Missing thepoetic genius of true prophets, his writings become mere "recapitulationof all superficial, opinions, and an analysis of the more sublime, butno further." Blake would have the works of true poets, those such as Shakespeareand Dante, who remake the reality they experience rather than acceptingthe limitations of a pre-defined discourse. These writers are tapped intothe true springs of vision, and are thus the "sunshine" to the "candles"of those who practice mere analytics. The crucial point of distinctionbetween the two camps is, once again, in the area of creative generationand the imagination.</font><p><font face="Geneva"><u>PLATES 22-24--A Memorable Fancy</u>:</font><p><font face="Geneva">Following up on the previous segment, this one commenceswith a discussion on the theme of genius and human greatness in vision,with an angel and a devil conversing as Blake the author (supposedly) sitsback and listens. The devil speaks first, as is the wont of those in thecamp of energy and impulse, saying: "The worship of God is, Honouring hisgifts in other men each according to his genius, and loving the greatestmen best; those who envy or calumniate great men hate God, for there isno other God." This is truly a radical statement, not only in that it definesthe role of genius, but also in that it confines the role of the Divineto one wholly within human parameters. With more prescience of Nietzsche,Blake here defines the <i>ubermensch</i> as the man who creates God inhuman form. The only Divinity is that which <i>we</i> are able to createthrough Poetic Genius, according to the devil’s camp, in that it is theonly version of the divine which we are really able to comprehend. Thisbears out also in that nature is "barren" without mankind and needs humanityto create its future potentiality. This definition, however anthropocentricand limited in light of modern theories of life within the universe(s),is still a fine definition of the functioning of emergent intelligencewithin the cosmos.</font><p><font face="Geneva">With tongue in cheek, Blake portrays the angel asturning bluish with anger, and emphatically, desperately declaring theholiness of Jesus Christ above all men. With the devil’s reply, however,we see Blake entering into a purely philosophical argument with conventionaltheology once again, this time at his most formally logical. In so doinghe answers all of the possible refutations of his possibly heretical workby pointing out the heresies of Jesus, and how these very betrayals byChrist of the old dictates led to his heightened holiness.</font><p><font face="Geneva">The devil begins, re-emphasizing the earlier principlesof the book regarding fools and the wise saying, "bray a fool in a morterwith wheat, yet shall not his folly be beaten out of him." Here the angelis the fool, for his reasoning is only analytical, and based upon falsepremises at that. Blake’s devil, however, is only using analysis, participatingin the angel’s game, in order to disprove the limited idiom of repressiveholiness; and he quickly proceeds to dispel the misconceptions of Christ’sheavenly nature made at the expense of his humanness. A list of the OldTestament commandments which Christ is said to have broken follows--thoroughlyestablishing him as of the rebel camp--and the devil delivers the killingblow: "I tell you, no virtue can exist without breaking these ten commandments;Jesus was all virtue, and acted from impulse, not from rules." This statementis incontrovertibly revisionist, establishing Jesus as a prophetic activistof Orcian energy and devilish defiance; and yet, given what we <i>don’t</i>know about Jesus’ life, wholly plausible. The angel can say no more, havingbeen defeated absolutely, and can only re-ascend to heavenly safety inthe form of Elijah.</font><p><font face="Geneva">That the devil speaking in these plates is Blakeemerges in the fact that the angel converts after this discussion to thestatus of a prophetic devil (or fallen devotee of the redintigrative process),and discusses the Bible "in its infernal or diabolical sense" with Blakeas his "particular friend." Here Blake refers subtly to his own works (suchas the one we cover here) saying, I have also: The Bible of Hell: whichthe world shall have whether they will or no." Obviously, this Bible, likethe "Parables of Hell," are from Blake’s own hand; and the world, Blakefeels confident in saying as he is a self-defined prophet, will eventuallycome around to the realization of the truths which he has outlined in hisworks. If the world were to "behave well"--i.e., act<i> ethically</i> towardstheir own imaginative potential--then they would have understanding ofthe dialogism between the infernal and the heavenly readings of the Bibleand of reality; but if they were to come around to the real recognitionof the infinite potentials of the mind, then they would be privileged toread from the "Bible of Hell," not of Blake’s creation, but from theirown dynamically activated energies of the body and mind.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Blake unqualifiedly declares, here at the end of<u>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</u>, that everything depends upon thetype of consciousness that an individual manifests as reality. There arefools and knaves; and there are the wise and the epiphanic poets. The worldthat each experiences is entirely different, qualitatively, and cannotbe defined in terms of the other’s. Tyrannical thinking would have everythingits way in order to secure its own intellectual security, but the wildand free ener-gies of the awakened consciousness cannot be limited, thoughoppressed at times, by such controlling forces: "One Law for the Lion &amp;Ox is Oppression." The oxen may lead the plow that rolls over the bonesof the</font><p><font face="Geneva">dead, but the lions of the imagination will alwaysbe the directors of such conquering of time and mortality.</font><p><font face="Geneva">In Blake’s vision of the justice of revolution,the false rulers (both of the mind and the body, as well as the internalizedtyrannies of fear and limitation) will either evolve and abdicate, or bereduced to "animal" states much like those of the monkeys in Blake’s earlierrefutation of the angel. This is displayed by the image of Nebuchadnezzar(fig. 13) at the bottom of the page and just preceding the "Lion &amp;Ox" epigram. The ancient Babylonian king who went insane and "did eat grassas an oxen" (Daniel iv:33), is shown retreating in fear back into a darkeningforest, moving away from Blake’s illumination. According to Damon, "Blakeconsiders this as signifying the madness of the materialist with singlevision: he becomes bestial in seeking his sustenance in material thingsonly" (297).</font><p><font face="Geneva">However, the great of mind--as defined by Blake--willalways be intrinsically unlimited because their conceptions of realityare open and dictated by inspirational intuitions rather than the repressivefears which drive oppression. This combined statement of illustration andepigram at the end of the plate acts as an apt conclusion to the main partof the book, as well as announcing the coming epilogue (prologue?), "ASong of Liberty." The "Song" prefigures all of Blake’s later revolutionaryworks and prophecies. It is, as we shall see, an outline of the illuminated"Bible of Hell" which Blake was to give to humanity, whether or not manyever read it in his own <i>mortal</i> lifetime.</font><p><font face="Geneva"><u>PLATES 25-27 -- A SONG OF LIBERTY</u>:</font><p><font face="Geneva">This last section of the book differs subtly yetsignificantly from that which precedes it (fig’s. 14-16). The text is morespacious and free, more light and open. These three pages are either morefloral or more lively than the dark and conflicted ones of the book towhich they are the epilogue. Bursting with botanical life, exuberant animalsand flying human figures, this section enacts pictorially what it declarestextually: Liberation. In the Chorus section at the very end we see thesoul both on the earth as bounding horses, and ascending as a bird of apotheosis.This lucidity and balanced clarity of vision comes as a relief and a rewardfor the arduous progression that the book has brought its reader through;yet it only confirms the power and proportion of Blake’s art.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Blake concludes his dialogic discourse, then, witha prophetic presentation of the means of revolutionary change and a demonstrationof the fact that no imposed and stubborn ordering of power or meaning maystand long before it is overturned by the cyclic force of creation. Inthe "Song of Liberty" Blake gives us for the first time explicit character-izationsof the principles which he would later, in such books as <u>The Book ofUrizen</u> and <u>The Four Zoas</u>, name as Enitharmon, Orc and Urizen.Here he introduces the prophetic model which would take him the rest ofhis life to properly develop, the raw form of an epic which would eventuallyencompass and allow for all and everything. Here the principle of Libertyis given to provide a call to action toward revolution, one pursuant uponall that has preceded it in the book.</font><p><font face="Geneva">In other words, Blake’s revolution is to be basedupon the very Liberty which he seeks to instigate within the self, onewhich effect-ively eliminates tyranny’s effects upon the self-exercisingliberties of the freed imagination. Literal revolution is for Blake, then,unnecessary, or at best only secondary. Teleologies of the mind have firstto be abolished, such that the polemics of politics and caste are seenas mere illusory hurdles within the pragmatic side of life. There is nonatural basis for tyrannical orderings, no inherent divine right of thepowerful, when it is recognized that the fact of the natural cosmos ischange and the dialogical correspondences of oppositional forces. For Blake,teleological thinking could not possibly be founded in the universe proceedingfrom the Divine sources of creation. This would be a universe too smallfor the illumined mind, and so could not have been created by any realkind of God. For Blake, the real form of the Divine is a human one, oneformed by the imagination in harmony with the body. Teleologies and determinism,then, can only be the productions of the fallen mind, or Urizen. Theseimposed models of human destiny are the jealousies of oppressive age inthe face of youthful vigor and freedom; they are the attempts of Urizento repress and control Orc, thereby limiting all growth of Man to thatwhich may be structured by rationalism.</font><p><font face="Geneva">In Blake’s larger ontological myth, creation fallsinto fragmentation when Albion becomes attached to the beauty of a singularaspect of his comprehensive being and, seeing and intellectualizing (thusobjectifying) the beautiful and feminine form of Vala, tumbles into anunconsciousness of the whole of his being. This gives rise to the tormentedsubdivision of his constituent elements, the Zoas; and as they are no longerable to work in harmony within Albion’s being, they enter into war withone another and even subdivide themselves into gendered spectral forms.One of these Zoas is Urizen--significant of the mental powers pervertedand inverted, involuting against the universe--who tumbles down first intothe fallen state from the "head" of Albion. He falls into depths of Urthona,personified as Los the blacksmith and redemptive artist, who builds a worldof matter to stop the fall from continuing on forever into the indefinite.Added to this dyadic situation of intellect and imagination in conflict,the forces of Luvah and Tharmas, of passion and cohesion, constitute thestatus of the universal psyche fallen into chaos and confusion. The energyof creativity, of Los working upon his anvil, engenders Orc (Luvah reborn)upon Enitharmon and allows for the possibility of the overthrow of Urizen’soppression and the building up of Golgonooza, which is the earthly foundationof the reconstituted New Jerusalem. From this "hell" a gradual weddingof the productions of time and relativity may commence until Jerusalemis embraced by Christ, and the integrity of Albion is restored. All ofthis is present, like a germinating seed, in this concluding section of<u>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</u>.</font><p><font face="Geneva">In "The Song of Liberty" Los’ feminine emanation,Enitharmon, is called the "Eternal Female," and is shown in the pains ofgiving birth to Orc, who brings forth the revolutionary energies of Luvahagainst the tyrannical Urizen and his rationalistic "ten commands." "Shadowsof Prophecy shiver," and a list of empires past and contemporary are evokedin the face of the coming upheaval Orc represents. Now life-denying empiresare "into the deep down falling," not the principles of the eternal Man;and this means that the energies of Orc are working against fallen ordersfor the redintigration and salvation of mankind.</font><p><font face="Geneva">On the pre-cataclysmic mountains of Atlantis Orcstands, in a time which is both primordial and ever-occurring, and is noticedby the envying and world-dominating Urizen, the "starry king" of the fallenintellect. The jealous Urizen, raised to ire over the appearance of a forcewhich he must know he cannot ultimately control, hurls Orc by his hairout over the deep. This action is doomed to failure, however, as the propheticvoice of Blake enters to say, in sublime epiphany of prophetic hope andrevolutionary faith, "The fire, the fire is falling!" "Look up! look up!"cries this voice to the people of the nations and races, rallying themto the purpose, to "enlarge" their countenances and expand their comprehensionand perception of reality. Orc is first described as if in death: "Thefiery limbs, the flaming hair, shot like the sinking sun into the westernsea;" but then, to the dismay of Urizen, he rises (like a model for Christ)in resurrection: "...Where the son of fire in his eastern cloud, whilethe morning plumes her Golden breast, / Spurning the clouds written withcurses, stamps the stony law to dust, loosing: the eternal horses fromthe dens of night...." Urizen falls, in his jealous haste, from his starryrealms, while Orc is ascendant with a new dawn for the earth. This is thefirst hope for redintegration of the fragmented soul of mankind. A Chorussings here at the end of a descent into hell--presumably one of rejoicinghumanity--revealing the heavenly reward of purgatorial art. The dark fateof self-limitation and socialized oppression are lifted as the "Priestsof the Raven of dawn" are vanquished or transformed into all-embracingangels who may, "no longer in deadly black, with hoarse note curse thesons of joy." Restrictions are removed to the cry of "Empire is no more!"and human potential is freed up to again experience the epiphany of theinfinity and holiness of all that is, "For every thing that lives is Holy."</font><p><font face="Geneva">In Blake’s view we are all ultimately consubstantialwith Albion or Christ; and in the psyche we are Jerusalem, either in disrepairor redintigrating, depending upon the level of realized vision of the individual.Liberation of the imagination is a monadic and microcosmic reconstitutionof the integrity of the universe. This enlightenment differs radicallyfrom the rationalistic and mechanistic one prevalent in Blake’s own time.It is also a <i>revolution</i> quite distinct from the violent and futileones which ensued on the political maps of his world. Since the divinemay only be known in human form, we are responsible for our own world andconstantly for its creation. Rather than war and tyranny, Blake proposesa sane and earthy solution: that we live in creative appreciation and interdependence,that we build together the eternal and transtemporal world where imaginationmay be unreigned and free to experience in absolute wonder the illimitableand ineluctable potentialities of being.</font><p><font face="Geneva">Works Cited / Bibliography:</font><p><font face="Geneva">Ackroyd, Peter. <u>Blake: A Biography</u>.
