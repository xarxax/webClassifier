Editor's Notes by Blake Linton Wilfong</B></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
"With the Night Mail" (1905) and its sequel "As Easy as A.B.C." (1912)
predicted that by the year 2000, airships (also called dirigibles—from the French
word <I>diriger</I> "to steer" because they were steerable balloons) would
prove superior to airplanes, and rule the skies.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It almost happened! Consider:
the first successful airship, a steam-driven cigar-shaped balloon, flew 17
miles over Paris in 1852--more than 50 years before Kitty Hawk. From 1910 to
1914, when airplanes were still flimsy toys, the German Airship
Transportation Company carried mail and 35,000 passengers without fatality.
In 1919, the British dirigible <I>R-34</I> made the first
transatlantic round-trip flight. The gigantic German airship <I>Graf
Zeppelin</I>, over 800 feet long and 100 in diameter, flew around the world
in 1929. Only after the <I>Hindenburg</I> explosion of 1937 did
dirigible passenger service end. If the invention of the airplane
had been delayed just a few more years, we might be traveling in high-tech
airships today. So Kipling's stories now make a marvelous "alternate history".<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Lighter-than-air conveyances had also already played major roles in science
fiction. Edgar Allan Poe's "The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall" (1835)
and "The Balloon Hoax" (1844), Jules Verne's <I>Five
Weeks in a Balloon</I> (1863) and <I>The Mysterious Island</I> (1874),
and Mark Twain's <I>Tom Sawyer Abroad</I> (1894) all feature such craft.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
"With the Night Mail" is narrated from the viewpoint of a journalist
accompanying a "postal packet" on an intercontinental mail run. I have
illustrated the story with some of the news reports and advertisements Kipling
fabricated for its magazine publication, and also with images of real airships that
had already been flown by Kipling's time.

At 9:00 of a gusty winter night I stand on the lower stages of one of the
General Post Office outward mail towers. My purpose: a run to Quebec in
"Postal Packet 162 or such other as may be appointed"; the
Postmaster General himself has countersigned the order. This talisman opens
all doors, even those in the dispatching-caisson at the foot of the tower,
where they are delivering the sorted Continental mail. The bags lie packed
close as herrings in the long gray underbodies our G.P.O. still calls
"coaches". Five coaches are filled as I watch, and shot up the guides to
be locked onto their waiting packets 300 feet nearer the stars.
<P>
Mr. L. L. Geary, Second Dispatcher of the Western Route, courteously
conducts me from the dispatching-caisson to the Captains' Room where the
mail captains come on for their turn of duty. He introduces me to the
captain of the "162"--Captain Purnall, and his relief, Captain Hodgson.
One is small and dark; the other large and red; but each has the brooding
sheathed glance characteristic of eagles and aeronauts. You can see it in
the pictures of our racing professionals, from L. V. Rautsch to little Ada
Warrleigh--that fathomless abstraction of eyes habitually turned through
naked space.
<P>
On the notice-board in the Captains' Room, the pulsing arrows of 20
indicators register, degree by geographical degree, the progress of
homeward-bound packets. The word "Cape" rises across the face of a dial; a
gong strikes: the South African midweekly mail is in at the Highgate
Receiving Towers. It reminds me comically of the little bell which in
pigeon-fanciers' lofts notifies the return of a homer.

"Time to go," says Captain Purnall. We shoot up via passenger-lift to
the top of the dispatch-towers. "Our coach will lock on when it's filled and
the clerks are aboard."
<P>
"No. 162" awaits in Slip E of the topmost stage. The great curve of her
back shines frostily under the lights, and some minute alteration of trim
makes her rock a little in her holding-down slips.
<P>
Captain Purnall frowns and dives inside. Hissing softly, "162" comes to
rest, level as a rule. From her North Atlantic Winter nose-cap (worn bright
as diamond with boring through uncounted leagues of hail, snow, and ice) to
the inset of her three built-out propeller-shafts is 240 feet. Her extreme
diameter, carried well forward, is 37. Contrast this with the 900 by 95 of
any crack liner, and you will realize the power that must drive a hull
through all weathers at more than the emergency speed of the
<I>Cyclonic</I>!
<P>
The eye detects no joint in her skin plating save the sweeping hair-crack of
the bow-rudder--Magniac's rudder that assured us the dominion of the
unstable air and left its inventor penniless and half-blind. It is
calculated to Castelli's "gull-wing" curve. Raise a few feet of that all but
invisible plate half an inch and she yaws five miles to port or starboard
ere regaining control. Give her full helm and she returns on her track like
a whiplash. Cant the whole forward--a touch on the wheel suffices--and she
sweeps up or down. Open the complete circle and she presents to the air a
mushroom-head that will bring her up all standing within half a mile.
<P>
"Yes," says Captain Hodgson, answering my thought, "Castelli thought he'd
discovered the secret of controlling airplanes, not dirigibles. Magniac
invented his rudder to help war-boats ram each other; but war went out of
fashion and Magniac went out of his mind because he said he couldn't serve
his country anymore. Do any of us ever know what we're really doing?"
<P>
"If you want to see the coach locked you'd better board now," says Mr.
Geary. I enter the door amidships. Nothing here is for display. The
inner skin of the gas-tanks comes down to within a foot of my head and turns
over just short of the bilges. Liners and yachts disguise their tanks with
decoration, but the G.P.O. serves them raw under a lick of gray official
paint. The inner skin shuts off 50 feet of the bow and stern, but the
bow-bulkhead is recessed for the lift-shunting apparatus as the stern is
pierced for the shaft-tunnels. The engine-room lies almost amidships.
Forward, extending to the bow tanks, is an aperture--now a bottomless
hatch--into which our coach will be locked. One looks down over the coamings
300 feet to the dispatching-caisson whence voices boom upward. Our coach
rises thunderously on its guides, enlarging rapidly from postage stamp to
pontoon boat size. The two clerks, its crew, do not even look up as it
arrives. The Quebec letters fly under their fingers into docketed racks,
while both captains and Mr. Geary verify that the coach is locked home. A
clerk passes the waybill over the hatch-coaming. Captain Purnall thumb-marks
and passes it to Mr. Geary. Receipt has been given and taken. "Pleasant
run," says Mr. Geary, disappearing through the door which a foot-high
pneumatic compressor locks after him.
<P>
"A-ah!" sighs the compressor released. Our holding-down clips part with a
tang. We are clear.
<P>
Captain Hodgson opens the great colloid underbody porthole through which I
watch over-lighted London slide eastward as the gale grabs us. Then the
first of the low winter clouds cuts off the view and darkens Middlesex. On
the south edge of it I see a postal packet's light ploughing through the
white fleece. She gleams momentarily like a star ere dropping toward the
Highgate Receiving Towers. "The Bombay Mail," says Captain Hodgson, and
looks at his watch. "She's 40 minutes late."
<P>
"What's our level?" I ask.
<P>
"4,000. Aren't you coming up on the bridge?"
<P>
The bridge is dominated by a view of Captain Hodgson's legs where he stands
in the Control Platform that runs thwart-ships overhead. The bow colloid is
unshuttered and Captain Purnall, one hand on the wheel, is feeling for a
fair slant. The dial shows 4,300 feet.
<P>
"It's steep tonight," he mutters, as tier on tier of cloud drops under.
"This time o' year we generally pick up an easterly draft below 3,000. I
hate slathering through fluff."
<P>
"5,000--6,000--6,800"--the dip-dial reads ere we find the easterly drift,
heralded by a flurry of snow at the thousand fathom level. Captain Purnall
rings up the engines and keys down the governor on the switch before him.
No sense urging machinery when Aeolus gives you good knots for nothing!
We are away in earnest now--our nose notched home on our chosen star. At
this level the lower clouds are laid out, all neatly combed by the dry
fingers of the East. Farther below is the strong westerly blow through which
we rose. Overhead, a film of southerly drifting mist draws a theatrical
gauze across the firmament. Moonlight turns the lower strata to silver
without a stain except our shadow. Bristol and Cardiff Double Lights (those
statelily-inclined beams over Severnmouth) are dead ahead; for we keep the
Southern Winter Route. Coventry Central, the pivot of the English system,
stabs upward every 10 seconds its spear of diamond light to the north; and a
point or two off our starboard bow The Leek, the great cloud-breaker of
Saint David's Head, swings its unmistakable green beam 25 degrees each way.
There must be half a mile of fluff over it in this weather, but it does not
affect The Leek.

"Our planet's overlighted if anything," says Captain Purnall at the wheel,
as Cardiff-Bristol slides under. "I remember the old common white verticals
that showed maybe 300 feet up in a mist, if you knew where to look. One
could get lost coming home then, an' have some fun. Now, it's like driving
down Piccadilly."
<P>
He points to the pillars of light where the cloud-breakers bore through the
cloud-floor. We see nothing of England's outlines: only a white pavement
pierced in all directions by these manholes of variously-colored fire--Holy
Island's white and red--St. Bee's interrupted white, etc. as far as the eye
can reach. Blessed be Sargent, Ahrens, and the Dubois brothers, who invented
the cloud-breakers whereby we travel in security!
<P>
"Are you going to lift for The Shamrock?" asks Captain Hodgson. Cork Light
(green, fixed) enlarges as we rush to it. Captain Purnall nods. There is
heavy traffic hereabouts--the cloud-bank beneath us is streaked with running
fissures of flame where the Atlantic boats are hurrying Londonward just
clear of the fluff. Under Conference rules, the 5,000-foot lanes are
reserved for mail-packets, but hurried foreigners often take liberties with
English air. "No. 162" lifts to a long-drawn wail of the breeze in the
fore-flange of the rudder and we make Valencia (white, green, white) at a
safe 7,000 feet, dipping our beam to an incoming Washington packet.
<P>
No clouds cover the Atlantic; faint streaks of cream around Dingle Bay show
where driven seas hammer the coast. A big S.A.T.A. liner (<I>Societe Anonyme
des Transports Aeriens</I>) dives and lifts half a mile below, searching for
some break in the solid west wind. Lower still lies a disabled Dane, telling
the liner all about it in International. Our General Communication dial has
caught her talk and begins to eavesdrop. "Perhaps you'd like to listen,"
Captain Hodgson says.

"<I>Argol</I> of St. Thomas," the Dane whimpers. "Report owners three
starboard shaft collar-bearings fused. Can make Flores as we are, but
impossible further."
<P>
The liner acknowledges and recommends inverting the bearings. <I>Argol</I>
answers that she has already done so, and rants about cheap German
enamels for collar-bearings. The Frenchman assents cordially, cries,
"<I>Courage, mon ami</I>," and switches off.
<P>
Their lights sink under the curve of the ocean.
<P>
"That's one of Lundt & Bleamers' boats," says Captain Hodgson. "Serves 'em
right, putting German compos in their thrust-blocks. Reminds me, wouldn't
you like to look around the engine-room?"
<P>
I eagerly follow Captain Hodgson from the Control Platform, stooping to
avoid the bulge of the tanks. Fleury's gas can lift anything, as the
famous trials of '89 showed, but its almost infinite powers of expansion
necessitate vast tank room. Even in this thin air the lift-shunts are busy
taking out one-third of its normal lift, and still "162" must be checked by
an occasional downdraw of the rudder or our flight would become a climb to
the stars. Captain Purnall prefers an overlifted to an underlifted ship; but
no two captains trim ship alike. "When <I>I</I> take the bridge," says
Captain Hodgson, "you'll see me shunt 40% of the lift out of the gas and run
her on the upper rudder. With a swoop upward instead of a swoop downward,
<I>as</I> you say. Either way will do. It's only habit. Watch our dip-dial!
Tim fetches her down once every 30 knots, regular as breathing."
<P>
So the dip-dial confirms. For five minutes the arrow creeps from 6,700 to
7,300. Then the faint "szgee" of the rudder, and back slides the arrow to
6,000 on a falling slant of 10 or 15 knots.
<P>
"In heavy weather you jockey her with the screws as well," says Captain
Hodgson, and, unclipping the jointed bar which divides the engine-room from
the bare deck, he leads me onto the floor.
<P>
Here we find Fleury's Paradox of the Bulkheaded Vacuum--which we accept now
without thought--literally in full blast. The three engines are H.T.&T.
assisted-vacuo Fleury turbines running from 3,000 to the Limit--that is, up
to the point when the blades make the air "bell"--cut out a vacuum for
themselves precisely as overdriven marine propellers used to do. "162's"
Limit is low due to the small size of her nine screws, which, though handier
than the old colloid Thelussons, "bell" sooner. The midships engine,
generally used as a reinforce, is not running; so the port and starboard
turbine vacuum-chambers draw direct into the return-mains.
<P>
The turbines whistle reflectively. From the low-arched expansion-tanks on
either side the valves descend pillarwise to the turbine-chests, and thence
the obedient gas whirls through the spirals of blades with a force that
would whip the teeth out of a power-saw. Behind, is its own pressure held in
leash or spurred on by the lift-shunts; before it, the vacuum where Fleury's
Ray dances in violet-green bands and whirled turbillons of flame. The
jointed U-tubes of the vacuum-chamber are pressure-tempered colloid (no
glass could endure the strain) and a junior engineer with tinted spectacles
watches the Ray intently. It is the heart of the machine--a mystery to this
day. Even Fleury who begat it and, unlike Magniac, died a multimillionaire,
could not explain how the restless little imp shuddering in the U-tube can,
in the fractional fraction of a second, strike the furious blast of gas into
a chill greyish-green liquid that drains from the far end of the vacuum
through the eduction-pipes and the mains back to the bilges. Here it returns
to its gaseous state and climbs to work afresh. Bilge-tank, upper tank,
dorsal-tank, expansion-chamber, vacuum, main-return (as a liquid), and
bilge-tank once more is the ordained cycle. Fleury's Ray sees to that; and
the engineer with the tinted spectacles sees to Fleury's Ray. Should a speck
of oil--even the natural grease of the human finger--touch the hooded
terminals, Fleury's Ray will wink and disappear and must be laboriously
built up again. This means half a day's work for all hands and an expense of
170-odd pounds to the G.P.O. for radium-salts, etc.
<P>
"Look at our thrust-collars. You won't find much German compo there.
Full-jeweled," boasts Captain Hodgson as the engineer shunts open the top of
a cap. Our shaft-bearings are C.M.C. (Commercial Minerals Company) stones,
ground as carefully as the lens of a telescope. They cost &#163;37 apiece.
So far we have not arrived at their term of life. These bearings came from
"No. 97", which took them over from the old <I>Dominion of Light</I> which
had them out of the wreck of the <I>Perseus</I> airplane back when men still
flew wooden kites over oil engines!
<P>
They are a shining reproof to all low-grade German "ruby" enamels, so-called
"boort" facings, and the dangerous and unsatisfactory alumina compounds
which please dividend-hunting owners and drive skippers crazy.
<P>
The rudder-gear and gas lift-shunt, seated side by side under the
engine-room dials, are the only machines in visible motion. The former sighs
occasionally as the oil plunger rises and falls half an inch. The
latter, cased and guarded like the U-tube aft, exhibits another Fleury Ray,
but inverted and more green than violet. Its function is to shunt the lift
out of the gas, and this it will do without watching. That is all! A tiny
pump-rod wheezing and whining to itself beside a sputtering green lamp. 150
feet aft down the flat-topped tunnel of the tanks a violet light, restless
and irresolute. Between the two, three white-painted turbine trunks, like
eel-baskets laid on their side, accentuate the empty perspectives. You can
hear the trickle of liquefied gas flowing from vacuum into the bilge-tanks
and the soft <I>gluck-glock</I> of gas-locks closing as Captain Purnall
brings "162" down by the head. The hum of the turbines and the boom of the
air on our skin is no more than a cotton-wool wrapping to the universal
stillness. And we are running an 18-second mile.
<P>
I peer from the fore end of the engine-room over the hatch-coamings into the
coach. Mail-clerks are sorting the Winnipeg, Calgary, and Medicine Hat bags;
but a pack of cards is ready on the table.
<P>
Suddenly a bell thrills; the engineers run to the turbine-valves and stand
by; but the spectacled slave of the Ray in the U-tube never lifts his head.
We are hard-braked and going astern; there is language from the Control
Platform.
<P>
"Tim's sparking badly about something," says the unruffled Captain Hodgson.
"Let's look."
<P>
Captain Purnall is not the suave man we left half an hour since, but the
embodied authority of the G.P.O. Ahead of us floats a dingy, ancient,
aluminum-patched, twin-screw tramp, with no more right to the 5,000-foot
lane than has a horse-cart to a mordern road. She carries an obsolete
"barbette" conning tower--a six-foot affair with railed platform
forward--and our warning beam plays upon it as a policeman's lantern flashes
on a thief. A shirt-sleeved, shock-headed navigator emerges reluctantly.
Captain Purnall wrenches open the colloid to talk man to man. There are
times when Science does not satisfy.

"What under the stars are you doing here, you sky-scraping chimney sweep?"
he shouts as we drift side by side. "Do you know this is a Mail-lane?
You call yourself a sailor, sir? You ain't fit to peddle toy balloons to an
Eskimo. I should have you towed stern first to Disko and broke up! Your name
and number! Report and get down, and be--"

The stranger bellows: "Look at my propellers! A wulli-wa down below has
knocked us into umbrella-frames! We've been blown up about 40,000 feet! My
mate's arm's broke; my engineer's head's cut open; my Ray went out when the
engines smashed; and...and...for pity's sake give me my height, Captain!"
<P>
"6,800. Can you hold it?" Captain Purnall, concern displacing anger, leans
half out of the colloid, staring and snuffing. The stranger leaks pungently.
<P>
"We'll blow into St. John's with luck. We're trying to plug the fore-tank
now, but she's simply whistling it away," her captain wails.
<P>
"She's sinking like a log," says Captain Purnall in an undertone. "Call up
the Banks Mark Boat, George." Our dip-dial shows that we, keeping abreast
the tramp, have dropped 500 feet already.
<P>
Captain Purnall presses a switch and our signal beam begins to swing through
the night, twizzling spokes of light across infinity.
<P>
"That'll fetch something," he says, while Captain Hodgson works the General
Communicator. He has called up the North Banks Mark Boat, a few hundred
miles west, and is reporting the case.
<P>
"I'll stand by you," Captain Purnall roars to the lone figure on the conning
tower.
<P>
"Is it that bad?" comes the answer. "She isn't insured. She's mine."
<P>
"Might have guessed," mutters Hodgson. "The worst gamble, ownership!"
<P>
"Can't I fetch St. John's with this breeze?" the voice quavers.

"Stand by to abandon ship. Haven't you <I>any</I> lift in you, fore or aft?"
<P>
"Nothing but the midship tanks, and they're none too tight. My Ray gave out
and--" he coughs in the reek of escaping gas.
<P>
"Poor devil!" This does not reach our friend. "What does the Mark Boat say,
George?"
<P>
"Asks if there's any danger to traffic. Says she's in a bit of weather
herself, and can't quit station. I've turned in a General Call, so even if
they don't see our beam someone's bound to help--or else we must. Shall I
clear our slings? Hold on! Here we are! A Planet liner, too! She'll be up in
a tick!"
<P>
"Tell her to ready her slings," cries his brother captain. "There won't
be much time to spare... Tie up your mate," he roars to the tramp.
<P>
"My mate's alright. It's my engineer. He's gone crazy."
<P>
"Shunt the lift out of him with a spanner. Hurry!"
<P>
"But I can make St. John's if you'll stand by."
<P>
"You'll make the deep, wet Atlantic in 20 minutes. You're less than 5,800
now. Get your papers."
<P>
A Planet liner, eastbound, heaves up in a superb spiral and takes the air of
us humming. Her underbody colloid is open and her transporter-slings hang
down like tentacles. We shut off our beam as she delicately maneuvers
over the tramp's conning tower. The mate comes up, arm strapped to his side,
and stumbles into the cradle. A man with a ghastly scarlet head follows,
shouting that he must go back and build up his Ray. The mate assures him
that he will find a nice new Ray all ready in the liner's engine-room. The
bandaged head goes up wagging excitedly. A youth and a woman follow. The
liner cheers hollowly above us, and we see the passengers' faces at the
saloon colloid.
<P>
"That's a pretty girl. What's the fool waiting for now?" says Captain
Purnall.
<P>
The skipper finally comes up--at which we little humans in the void cheer
louder than ever--with the ship's kitten. Up fly the liner's hissing slings;
her underbody crashes home and she hurtles away again. The dial shows less
than 3,000 feet.
<P>
The Mark Boat signals we must attend to the derelict, now whistling her
death-song, as she falls beneath us in long sick zigzags.
<P>
"Keep our beam on her and send out a General Warning," says Captain Purnall,
following her down.
<P>
No need. Every liner in air knows the meaning of that vertical beam and
gives us and our quarry a wide berth.
<P>
"But she'll drown in the water, won't she?" I ask.
<P>
"Not always," he answers. "I've known a derelict to upend and sift her
engines out of herself and flicker around the Lower Lanes for three weeks on
her forward tanks only. We'll run no risks. Pith her, George, and look
sharp. There's weather ahead."
<P>
Captain Hodgson opens the underbody colloid, swings the heavy pithing-iron
out of its rack which in liners is generally cased as a smoking-room settee,
and at 200 feet releases the catch. We hear the whir of the crescent-shaped
arms opening as they descend. The derelict's forehead is punched in and rent
diagonally. She falls stern first, our beam upon her; slides like a lost
soul down that pitiless ladder of light, and the Atlantic takes her.
<P>
"A filthy business," says Hodgson. "I wonder what it was like in the old
days?"
<P>
The thought had crossed my mind too. What if that wavering carcass had been
filled with men, each of them taught (<I>that</I> is the horror of it!) that
after death he might go forever to unspeakable torment?
<P>
And scarcely a generation ago <I>we</I> ourselves ripped and rammed and
pithed to admiration.
<P>
Tim, from the Control Platform, shouts that we are to don our inflators
and bring him his at once.

We hurry into the heavy rubber suits--the engineers are already dressed--and
inflate at the air pump taps. G.P.O. inflators are thrice as thick as a
racing man's "flickers," and chafe abominally under the armpits. George
takes the wheel until Tim has blown himself up to extreme rotundity. If you
kicked him off the c.p. to the deck he would bounce back. But it is "162"
that will do the kicking.
<P>
"The Mark Boat's stark ravin' mad," he snorts, returning to command. "She
says there's a bad blow-out ahead and wants me to pull over to Greenland.
I'll see her pithed first! We wasted half an hour fussing over that dead
duck down under, and now I'm expected to go rubbin' my back all round the
Pole. What does she think a postal packet's made of? Gummed silk? Tell her
we're coming on straight, George."
<P>
George buckles him into the Frame and switches on the Direct Control. Now
under Tim's left toe lies the port-engine Accelerator; under his left heel
the Reverse, and so with the other foot. The lift-shunt stops stand out on
the rim of the steering wheel where the fingers of his left hand can play on
them. At his right hand is the midships engine lever, ready to be thrown
into gear at a moment's notice. He leans forward in his belt, eyes glued to
the colloid, one ear cocked toward the General Communicator. Henceforth he
is the strength and direction of "162", through whatever may befall.
<P>
The Banks Mark Boat is reeling out pages of A.B.C. Directions to the traffic
at large. We are to secure all "loose objects"; hood up our Fleury Rays; and
"on no account attempt to clear snow from our conning towers till the
weather abates." Underpowered craft, we are told, can ascend to the limits
of their lift, mail-packets to look out for them accordingly; the lower
lanes westward are pitting badly, "with frequent blow-outs, vortices,
laterals, etc."
<P>
Still the clear dark holds up unblemished. The only warning is the electric
skin-tension (I feel like a pincushion) and an irritability which the
General Communicator's gibbering increases almost to hysteria.

We have made 8,000 feet since we pithed the tramp and our turbines are
giving us an honest 210 knots.
<P>
Far to the west an elongated blur of red, low down, shows us the North
Banks Mark Boat. There are specks of fire around her rising and
falling--bewildered planets about an unstable sun--helpless shipping hanging
onto her light for company's sake. No wonder she could not quit station.
<P>
She warns us to look out for the backwash of the bad vortex in which (her
beam shows it) she is even now reeling.
<P>
The pits of gloom about us fill with faintly luminous films--wreathing,
uneasy shapes. One forms itself into a globe of pale flame that waits
shivering with eagerness till we sweep by. It leaps monstrously across the
blackness, alights on the tip of our nose, pirouettes there an instant, and
swings off. Our roaring bow sinks as though that light were lead--then
recovers to lurch and stumble again beneath the next blow-out. Tim's fingers
on the lift-shunt strike chords of numbers--1:4:7--2:4:6--7:5:3, etc.; for
he is running by his tanks only, lifting or lowering her against the uneasy
air. All three engines are at work; the sooner we have skated over this thin
ice the better. Higher we dare not go. The whole upper vault is charged with
pale krypton vapors, which our skin friction may excite to unholy
manifestations. Between the upper and lower levels--5,000 and 7,000, hints
the Mark Boat--we may perhaps bolt through if... Our bow clothes itself in
blue flame and falls like a sword. No human skill can keep pace with the
changing tensions. A vortex has us by the beak and we dive down a 2,000 foot
slant at an angle (the dip-dial and my bouncing body record it) of 35. Our
turbines scream shrilly; the propellers cannot bite on the thin air; Tim
shunts the lift out of five tanks at once and by sheer weight drives her
bullet-wise though the maelstrom till she cushions with a jar on an up-gust,
3,000 feet below.
<P>
"<I>Now</I> we've done it," says George in my ear. "Our skin-friction, that
last slide, has played Old Harry with the tensions! Look out for laterals,
Tim; she'll want some holding."
<P>
"I've got her," is the answer. "Come <I>up</I>, old woman."
<P>
She comes up nobly, but the laterals buffet her left and right like the
pinions of angry angels. She is jolted off course four ways at once, and
cuffed into place again, only to be swung aside and dropped into new chaos.
We are never without a corposant grinning on our bows or rolling head over
heels from nose to midships, and to the crackle of electricity around and
within us is added once or twice the rattle of hail--hail that will never
fall on any sea. Slow we must or we may break our back, pitch-poling.
<P>
"Air's a perfectly elastic fluid," roars George above the tumult. "About as
elastic as a head sea off the Fastnet, ain't it?"
<P>
He is less than just to the good element. If one intrudes when the Heavens
are balancing their volt-accounts; if one disturbs the High Gods'
market-rates by hurling steel hulls at 90 knots across tremblingly adjusted
electric tensions, one must not complain of any rudeness in the reception.
Tim meets it with an unmoved countenance, one corner of his underlip caught
up on a tooth, his eyes fleeting into the blackness 20 miles ahead, and
fierce sparks flying from his knuckles at every turn of the hand. Now and
again he shakes his head to clear the sweat trickling from his eyebrows, and
George, watching his chance, slides down the life-rail and swabs his face
quickly with a big red handkerchief. I never imagined a human being could so
continuously labor and so collectedly think as Tim does now as the flurry
reaches its worst. For a hellish half-hour, we are dragged hither and yon by
warm or frozen suctions, belched up on the slopes of wulli-was, spun down by
vortices and clubbed aside by laterals under a dizzying rush of stars in the
company of a drunken moon. I hear the rushing click of the
midship-engine-lever sliding in and out, the low growl of the lift-shunts,
and, louder than the yelling winds without, the scream of the bow-rudder
gouging into any lull that promises hold for an instant. At last we begin to
claw up on a cant, bow-rudder and port-propeller together; only the nicest
balancing of tanks saves us from spinning like the rifle-bullet of the old
days.
<P>
"We've got to hitch to windward of that Mark Boat somehow," George cries.
<P>
"There's no windward," I protest feebly, where I swing shackled to a
stanchion. "How can there be?"
<P>
He laughs--as we pitch into a thousand foot blow-out--that red man laughs
beneath his inflated hood!
<P>
"Look!" he says. "We must clear those refugees with a high lift."
<P>
The Mark Boat is below and a little southwest of us, fluctuating in the
center of her distraught galaxy. The air is thick with moving lights at
every level. I take it most of them are trying to lie head to wind, but, not
being hydras, they fail. An under-tanked Moghrabi boat rises to the limit of
her lift, and, finding no improvement, drops a couple of thousand. There she
meets a superb wulli-wa, and blows upward spinning like a dead leaf. Instead
of shutting off she goes astern and, naturally, rebounds as from a wall
almost into the Mark Boat, whose language (our G.C. takes it in) is humanly
simple.
<P>
"If they'd only ride it out quietly it 'ud be better," says George in a
calm, while we climb like a bat above them all. "But some skippers
<I>will</I> navigate without enough lift. What does that Tad-boat think
she's doing, Tim?"
<P>
"Playin' kiss in the ring," is Tim's unmoved reply. A Trans-Asiatic Direct
liner has found a smooth and butted into it full power. But there is a
vortex at the tail of that smooth, so the T.A.D. is flipped out like a pea
from off a fingernail, braking madly as she flees down and all but
over-ending.
<P>
"Now I hope she's satisfied," says Tim. "I'm glad I'm not a Mark Boat... Do
I want help?" The General Communicator dial has caught his ear. "George, you
may tell that gentleman with my love--love, remember, George--that I do not
want help. Who <I>is</I> the officious sardine-tin?"
<P>
"A Rimouski drogher on the lookout for a tow."
<P>
"How kind. This postal packet isn't being towed at present."
<P>
"Those droghers will go anywhere on a chance of salvage," George explains.
<P>
A long-beaked, bright steel 90-footer floats at ease momentarily within
hail of us, her slings coiled ready for rescues, and a single hand in her
open tower. He is smoking. Surrendering to the insurrection of the airs
through which we tear our way, he lies in absolute peace. I see the smoke of
his pipe ascend untroubled ere his boat drops like a stone in a well.
<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=LEFT><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER><TR BGCOLOR=BLACK>

</TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE>
We have just cleared the Mark Boat and her disorderly neighbors when a
shooting star to northward fills the sky with the bright blink of a
meteorite dissipating itself in our atmosphere.
<P>
Says George, "That may iron out all the tensions." Even as he speaks the
storm ends: conflicting winds come to rest; the levels fill; the laterals
die out in long, easy swells; the airways are smoothed before us. Within
three minutes the covey around the Mark Boat ships their power-lights and
whirs away on their businesses.
<P>
"What happened?" I gasp. The nerve-storm within and volt-tingle without have
passed; my inflators weigh like lead.
<P>
"That old shooting star's skin-friction has discharged the different levels.
I've seen it happen before. Phew! What a relief!"
<P>
We drop from ten to six thousand and doff our clammy suits. Tim shuts off
and steps out of the Frame. The Mark Boat is coming up behind us. He opens
the colloid in that heavenly stillness and mops his face.
<P>
"Hello, Williams!" he cries. "A degree or two out o' station, ain't you?"
<P>
"Maybe," is the answer from the Mark Boat. "I've had company this evening."
<P>
"So I noticed. Wasn't that quite a little draft?"
<P>
"I warned you. Why didn't you pull out north? The eastbound packets have."
<P>
"Me? Not till I'm running a Polar consumptives' sanatorium boat. I was
squinting through a colloid before you were out of your cradle, son."
<P>
"I'd be the last to deny it," the captain of the Mark Boat replies softly.
"The way you handled her just now--I'm a pretty fair judge of traffic in a
volt-hurry--it was a thousand revolutions beyond anything I've ever seen."
<P>
Tim's back supples visibly to this oiling. Captain George on the c.p. winks
and points to the portrait of a singularly attractive maiden pinned up on
Tim's telescope bracket above the steering wheel.
<P>
I see. Wholly and entirely do I see!
<P>
There is talk overhead of "coming round to tea on Friday," a brief report of
the derelict's fate, and Tim volunteers as he descends: "For an A.B.C. man
young Williams is less of a high-tension fool than some... Were you thinking
of taking her on, George? Then I'll just have a look at that
port-thrust--seems to me it's a trifle warm--and we'll jog along."

<FONT SIZE=2><P>
The story of the recent Cretan crisis, as told in the <I>A.B.C. Monthly<BR>
Report</I>, is not without humor. Till the 25th October Crete, as all<BR>
our planet knows, was the sole surviving European repository of<BR>
"autonomous institutions," "local self-government," and the rest<BR>
of the archaic lumber devised in the past for the confusion of<BR>
human affairs. She has lived practically on the tourist traffic<BR>
attracted by her annual pageants of Parliaments, Boards, Municipal<BR>
Councils, etc., etc. Last summer the islanders grew wearied, as<BR>
their premier explained, of "playing at being savages for pennies,"<BR>
and proceeded to pull down all the landing-towers on the island<BR>
and shut off general communication till such time as the A.B.C.<BR>
should annex them. For side-splitting comedy we would refer our<BR>
readers to the correspondence between the Board of Control and<BR>
the Cretan premier during the "war". However, all's well that ends<BR>
well. The A.B.C. has taken over the administration of Crete on<BR>
normal lines; and tourists must go elsewhere to witness the<BR>
"debates," "resolutions," and "popular movements" of yore. The<BR>
only people to suffer will be the Board of Control, which is<BR>
grievously overworked already. It is easy enough to condemn the<BR>
Cretans for their laziness; but when one recalls the large,<BR>
prosperous, and presumably public-spirited communities which<BR>
during the last few years have deliberately thrown themselves into<BR>
the hands of the A.B.C., one cannot be too hard on St. Paul's old<BR>
friends.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
The Mark Boat hums off joyously and hangs herself up in her appointed eyrie.
Here she will stay a shutterless observatory; a lifeboat station; a salvage
tug; a court of ultimate appeal-cum-meteorological bureau for 300 miles in
all directions, till Wednesday next when her relief slides across the stars
to take her buffeted place. Her black hull, double conning tower, and
ever-ready slings represent all that remains to the planet of that odd old
word "authority". She is responsible only to the Aerial Board of
Control--the A.B.C. of which Tim speaks so flippantly. But that
semi-elected, semi-nominated body of a few score persons of both sexes,
controls this planet. "Transportation is Civilization," our motto runs.
Theoretically, we do what we please so long as we do not interfere with the
traffic <I>and all it implies</I>. Practically, the A.B.C. confirms or
annuls all international arrangements and, to judge from its last report,
finds our tolerant, humorous, lazy little planet only too ready to shift the
whole burden of public administration onto its shoulders.
<P>
I discuss this with Tim, sipping mat&eacute; on the c.p. while George fans
her along over the white blur of the Banks in beautiful upward curves of 50
miles each. The dip-dial translates them on the tape in flowing freehand.
<P>
Tim gathers up a skein of it and surveys the last few feet, which record
"162's" path through the volt-flurry.
<P>
"Haven't had a fever-chart like this in five years," he says ruefully.
<P>
A postal packet's dip-dial records every yard of every run. The tapes then
go to the A.B.C., which collates and makes composite photographs of them for
the instruction of captains. Tim studies his irrevocable past, shaking his
head.
<P>
"Hello! Here's a 1,500-foot drop at 55 degrees! We must have been standing
on our heads then, George."
<P>
"You don't say," George answers. "I fancied I noticed it at the time."
<P>
George may not have Captain Purnall's catlike swiftness, but he is an
artist to the tips of the broad fingers that play on the shunt-stops. The
delicious flight-curves come away on the tape without a waver. The Mark
Boat's verticle spindle of light lies down to eastward, setting in the face
of the following stars. Westward, where no planet should rise, the triple
verticals of Trinity Bay (we keep still to the Southern route) make a
low-lifting haze. We seem the only thing at rest under all the heavens;
floating at ease till Earth's revolution shall turn up our landing-towers.
<P>
And minute by minute our silent clock gives us a 16-second mile.
<P>
"Some fine night," says Tim, "we'll be even with that clock's Master."
<P>
"He's coming now," says George, over his shoulder. "I'm chasing the night
west."
<P>
The stars ahead dim no more than if a film of mist had been drawn under
unobserved, but the deep air-boom on our skin changes to a joyful shout.
<P>
"The dawn-gust", says Tim. "It'll go on to meet the Sun. Look! There's the
dark being crammed back over our bows! Come to the after-colloid. I'll show
you something."
<P>
The engine-room is hot and stuffy; the clerks in the coach are asleep, and
the Slave of the Ray is ready to follow them. Tim slides open the aft
colloid and reveals the curve of the world--the ocean's deepest
purple--edged with fuming and intolerable gold. Then the Sun rises and
through the colloid strikes out our lamps. Tim scowls in his face and
mutters, "He's going twice as fast as us. Just you wait a few years, my
shining friend, and we'll take steps that will amaze you. <I>We</I>'ll
Joshua you!"

Yes, that is our dream: to turn all Earth into the Vale of Ajalon at our
pleasure. So far, we can drag out the dawn to twice its normal length in
these latitudes. But someday--even on the Equator--we shall hold the Sun
level in his full stride.
<P>
We look down on a sea thronged with heavy traffic. A big submersible breaks
water suddenly. Another and another follows with a swash, a suck, and a
savage bubbling of relieved pressures. The deep-sea freighters are rising to
lung up after the long night, and the leisurely ocean is patterned with
peacock's eyes of foam.
<P>
"We'll lung up, too," says Tim, and when we return to the c.p. George shuts
off, the colloids are opened, and fresh air sweeps her out. There is no
hurry. The old contracts (they will be revised at the end of the year) allow
12 hours for a run which any packet can finish in 10. So we breakfast in the
arms of an easterly slant which pushes us along at a languid 20.
<P>
To enjoy life, begin on a sunny morning half a mile or so above the dappled
Atlantic cloud-belts and after a volt-flurry which has cleared and tempered
your nerves. We idly discuss the thickening traffic with the superiority
that comes of having a high level reserved to ourselves--then fall silent.
Is it our imaginations, or can we smell even up here the salty sea breeze,
harking us back to the romance of the tall ships of old?
<P>
At last, George gently reminds us of duty. "Are we to spend our whole lives
here, Tim?" says he with a twinkle in his eye.
<P>
"Flap ahead, then. Who's hindering?" the senior captain laughs, as we go in.
<P>
We hold a good lift to clear the coastwise and Continental shipping; and we
need it. Though our route is hardly a populated one, there is a steady
trickle of traffic this way along. We meet Hudson Bay furriers out of the
Great Preserve, hurrying to make their departure from Bonavista with sable
and black frox for the insatiable markets. We over-cross Keewatin liners,
small and cramped, but their captains, who see no land between Trepassy and
Blanco, know what gold they bring back from West Africa. Trans-Asiatic
Directs we meet, soberly ringing the world around the 50th Parallel at an
honest 70 knots; and white-painted Ackroyd & Hunt fruiters out of the south
flee beneath us, ventilated hulls whistling like Chinese kites. Their market
is in the North among the northern sanatoria where you can smell their
grapefruit and bananas across the cold snows. Agrentine beef boats we sight
too, of enormous capacity and unlovely outline. They, too, feed the northern
health stations in icebound ports where submersibles dare not rise.
<P>
Yellow-bellied ore-flats and Ungava petrol-tanks punt down leisurely out of
the north, like strings of unfrightened wild duck. It does not pay to "fly"
minerals and oil a mile farther than necessary; but the risks of
transhipping to submersibles in the ice pack off Nain or Hebron are so great
that these heavy freighters fly down to Halifax direct, and scent the air as
they go. They are the biggest tramps aloft except the Athabasca grain-tubs.
But these last, now that the wheat is moved, are busy, over the world's
shoulder, timber-lifting in Siberia.
<P>
We hold to the St. Lawrence (it is astonishing how the old waterways still
pull us children of the air), and follow his broad line of black between its
drifting ice-blocks, all down the Park that the wisdom of our fathers--but
everyone knows the Quebec run.

We drop to the Heights Receiving Towers 20 minutes early, and there hang at
ease till the Yokohama Intermediate Packet can pull out and give us our
proper slip. It is curious to watch the action of the holding-down clamps
all along the frosty riverfront as the boats clear or come to rest. A big
