<p>It appears that you were looking for the page /robots.txt. Sorry, but that's not here anymore.  make changes now and then, so this can happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're looking for my <em>Space Ghost Coast to Coast</em> episode guide, please check out the
<a href="/sg/guide/">new and improved version</a>.</li>
<li>If you're looking for a transcript for an episode of said program, I've recently moved them to a
new location. Actually, they're being done in a slightly different way, the best way to view them
is to check out the above <a href="/sg/guide/">episode guide</a>.
<li>If you're looking for something else, but can't find it, then I'd suggest you look again, because
there really isn't anything else that's been moved recently. The main areas of this site are the
<a href="/">home page</a> and the <a href="/sg/">Ghost Planet Central</a> sections. Browse around there,
I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for. If not, you can always <a href="mailto:snard12@yahoo.com">email
me</a>.
