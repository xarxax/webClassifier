<DT><font size="+1">H</font>OW do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
<DT>I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
<DT>My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
<DT>For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
<DT>I love thee to the level of everyday's
<DT>Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
<DT>I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
<DT>I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
<DT>I love thee with the passion put to use
<DT>In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
<DT>I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
<DT>With my lost saints, -I love thee with the breath,
<DT>Smiles, tears, of all my life! - and, if God choose,
<DT>I shall but love thee better after death.

<Dt><font size="+1">W</font>HAT was he doing, the great god Pan,
<Dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down in the reeds by the river?
<Dt>Spreading ruin and scattering ban,
<Dt>Splashing and paddling with hoofs of a goat,
<Dt>And breaking the golden lilies afloat
<Dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the dragon-fly on the river.
<p>
<Dt>He tore out a reed, the great god Pan,
<Dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the deep cool bed of the river:
<Dt>The limpid water turbidly ran,
<Dt>And the broken lilies a-dying lay,
<Dt>And the dragon-fly had fled away,
<Dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere he brought it out of the river.
<p>
<Dt>High on the shore sat the great god Pan
<Dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While turbidly flowed the river;
<Dt>And hacked and hewed as a great god can,
<Dt>With his hard bleak steel at the patient reed,
<Dt>Till there was not a sign of the leaf indeed
<Dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prove it fresh from the river.
<p>
<Dt>He cut it short, did the great god Pan,
<Dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(How tall it stood in the river!)
<Dt>Then drew the pith, like the heart of a man,
<Dt>Steadily from the outside ring,
<Dt>And notched the poor dry empty thing
<Dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In holes, as he sat by the river.
<p>
<Dt>"This is the way," laughed the great god Pan
<Dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Laughed while he sat by the river),
<Dt>"The only way, since gods began
<Dt>To make sweet music, they could succeed."
<Dt>Then, dropping his mouth to a hole in the reed,
<Dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He blew in power by the river.
<p>
<Dt>Sweet, sweet, sweet, O Pan!
<Dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piercing sweet by the river!
<Dt>Blinding sweet, O great god Pan!
<Dt>The sun on the hill forgot to die,
<Dt>And the lilies revived, and the dragon-fly
<Dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came back to dream on the river.
<P>
<dt>Yet half a beast is the great god Pan,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To laugh as he sits by the river,
<dt>Making a poet out of a man:
<dt>The true gods sigh for the cost and pain, --
<dt>For the reed which grows nevermore again
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a reed with the reeds in the river.

<DT><font size="+1">F</font>IVE months ago the stream did flow,
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lilies bloomed within the sedge,
<DT>And we were lingering to and fro,
<DT>Where none will track thee in this snow,
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the stream, beside the hedge.
<DT>Ah, Sweet, be free to love and go!
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For if I do not hear thy foot,
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frozen river is as mute,
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowers have dried down to the root:
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And why, since these be changed since May,
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shouldst thou change less than they.
<P>
<DT>And slow, slow as the winter snow
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tears have drifted to mine eyes;
<DT>And my poor cheeks, five months ago
<DT>Set blushing at thy praises so,
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put paleness on for a disguise.
<DT>Ah, Sweet, be free to praise and go!
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For if my face is turned too pale,
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was thine oath that first did fail, --
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was thy love proved false and frail, --
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And why, since these be changed enow,
<DT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should I change less than thou.

<UL><DL><p>
<DT><font size="+1">I</font> TELL you, hopeless grief is passionless;
<DT>That only men incredulous of despair,
<DT>Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air
<DT>Beat upward to God's throne in loud access
<DT>Of shrieking and reproach. Full desertness,
<DT>In souls as countries, lieth silent-bare
<DT>Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare
<DT>Of the absolute Heavens. Deep-hearted man, express
<DT>Grief for thy Dead in silence like to death--
<DT>Most like a monumental statue set
<DT>In everlasting watch and moveless woe
<DT>Till itself crumble to the dust beneath.
<DT>Touch it; the marble eyelids are not wet:
<DT>If it could weep, it could arise and go.

<dt><font size="+1">'B</font>UT where do you go?' said the lady, while both sat under the yew,
<dt>And her eyes were alive in their depth, as the kraken beneath the sea-blue.<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>II</b><p>
<dt>'Because I fear you,' he answered;--'because you are far too fair,
<dt>And able to strangle my soul in a mesh of your gold-coloured hair.'<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>III</b><p>
<dt>'Oh that,' she said, 'is no reason! Such knots are quickly undone,
<dt>And too much beauty, I reckon, is nothing but too much sun.'<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>IV</b><p>
<dt>'Yet farewell so,' he answered; --'the sunstroke's fatal at times.
<dt>I value your husband, Lord Walter, whose gallop rings still from the limes.<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>V</b><p>
<dt>'Oh that,' she said, 'is no reason. You smell a rose through a fence:
<dt>If two should smell it what matter? who grumbles, and where's the pretense?<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>VI</b><p>
<dt>'But I,' he replied, 'have promised another, when love was free,
<dt>To love her alone, alone, who alone from afar loves me.'<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>VII</b><p>
<dt>'Why, that,' she said, 'is no reason. Love's always free I am told.
<dt>Will you vow to be safe from the headache on Tuesday, and think it will hold?<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>VIII</b><p>
<dt>'But you,' he replied, 'have a daughter, a young child, who was laid
<dt>In your lap to be pure; so I leave you: the angels would make me afraid."<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>IX</b><p>
<dt>'Oh that,' she said, 'is no reason. The angels keep out of the way;
<dt>And Dora, the child, observes nothing, although you should please me and stay.'<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>X</b><p>
<dt>At which he rose up in his anger,--'Why now, you no longer are fair!
<dt>Why, now, you no longer are fatal, but ugly and hateful, I swear.'<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>XI</b><p>
<dt>At which she laughed out in her scorn: 'These men! Oh these men overnice,
<dt>Who are shocked if a colour not virtuous is frankly put on by a vice.'<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>XII</b><p>
<dt>Her eyes blazed upon him--'And <i>you</i>! You bring us your vices so near
<dt>That we smell them! You think in our presence a thought 'twould defame us to hear!<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>XIII</b><p>
<dt>'What reason had you, and what right,--I appeal to your soul from my life,--
<dt>To find me so fair as a woman? Why, sir, I am pure, and a wife.<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>XIV</b><p>
<dt>'Is the day-star too fair up above you? It burns you not. Dare you imply
<dt>I brushed you more close than the star does, when Walter had set me as high?<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>XV</b><p>
<dt>'If a man finds a woman too fair, he means simply adapted too much
<dt>To use unlawful and fatal. The praise! --shall I thank you for such?<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>XVI</b><p>
<dt>'Too fair?--not unless you misuse us! and surely if, once in a while,
<dt>You attain to it, straightaway you call us no longer too fair, but too vile.<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>XVII</b><p>
<dt>'A moment,--I pray your attention!--I have a poor word in my head
<dt>I must utter, though womanly custom would set it down better unsaid.<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>XVIII</b><p>
<dt>'You grew, sir, pale to impertinence, once when I showed you a ring.
<dt>You kissed my fan when I dropped it. No matter! I've broken the thing.<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>XIX</b><p>
<dt>'You did me the honour, perhaps, to be moved at my side now and then
<dt>In the senses--a vice, I have heard, which is common to beasts and some men.<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>XX</b><p>
<dt>'Love's a virtue for heroes!--as white as the snow on high hills,
<dt>And immortal as every great soul is that struggles, endures, and fulfils.<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>XXI</b><p>
<dt>'I love my Walter profoundly,--you, Maude, though you faltered a week,
<dt>For the sake of . . . what is it--an eyebrow? or, less still, a mole on the cheek?<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>XXII</b><p>
<dt>'And since, when all's said, you're too noble to stoop to the frivolous cant
<dt>About crimes irresistable, virtues that swindle, betray and supplant.<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>XXIII</b><p>
<dt>'I determined to prove to yourself that, whate'er you might dream or avow
<dt>By illusion, you wanted precisely no more of me than you have now.<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>XXIV</b><p>
<dt>'There! Look me full in the face!--in the face. Understand, if you can,
<dt>That the eyes of such women as I am are clean as the palm of a man.<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>XXV</b><p>
<dt>'Drop his hand, you insult him. Avoid us for fear we should cost you a scar--
<dt>You take us for harlots, I tell you, and not for the women we are.<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>XXVI</b><p>
<dt>'You wronged me: but then I considered . . . there's Walter! And so at the end
<dt>I vowed that he should not be mulcted, by me, in the hand of a friend.<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>XXVII</b><p>
<dt>'Have I hurt you indeed? We are quits then. Nay, friend of my Walter, be mine!
<dt>Come, Dora, my darling, my angel, and help me to ask him to dine.'<p>

<i>Alas, alas! my children, why do you look upon me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-- the <b>Medea</b> of Euripedes</i>
<UL><DL><P>
<dt><font size="+1">D</font>O ye hear the children weeping, O my brothers,
<dd>    Ere the sorrow comes with years?
<dt>They are leaning their young heads against their mothers,
<dd>    And <i>that</i> cannot stop their tears.
<dt>The young lambs are bleating in the meadows,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The young birds are chirping in the nest,
<dt>The young fawns are playing with the shadows,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The young flowers are blowing toward the west --
<dt>But the young, young children, O my brothers,
<dd>    They are weeping bitterly!
<dt>They are weeping in the playtime of the others,
<dd>    In the country of the free.
<p>
<dt>Do you question the young children in the sorrow
<dd>    Why their tears are falling so?
<dt>The old man may weep for his tomorrow
<dd>    Which is lost in Long Ago;
<dt>The old tree is leafless in the forest,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The old year is ending in the frost,
<dt>The old wound, if stricken, is the sorest,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The old hope is hardest to be lost;
<dt>But the young, young children, O my brothers,
<dd>    Do you ask them why they stand
<dt>Weeping sore before the bosoms of their mothers,
<dd>    In our happy Fatherland?
<p>
<dt>They look up with their pale and sunken faces,
<dd>    And their looks are sad to see,
<dt>For the man's hoary anguish draws and presses
<dd>    Down the cheeks of infancy;
<dt>"Your old earth," they say, "is very dreary,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Our young feet," they say, " are very weak;
<dt>Few paces have we taken, yet are weary --
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Our grave-rest is very far to seek;
<dt>Ask the aged why they weep, and not the children,
<dd>    For the outside earth is cold,
<dt>And we young ones stand without, in our bewildering,
<dd>    And the graves are for the old.
<p>
<dt>"True," say the children, "it may  happen
<dd>    That we die before our time;
<dt>Little Alice died last year; her grave is shapen
<dd>    Like a snowball, in the rime.
<dt>We looked into the pit prepared to take her;
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Was no room for any work in the close clay!
<dt>From the sleep wherein she lieth none will wake her,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Crying, 'Get up, little Alice! it is day.'
<dt>If you listen by that grave, in sun and shower,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  With your ear down, little Alice never cries;
<dt>Could we see her face, be sure we should not know her,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For the smile has time for growing in her eyes;
<dt>And merry go her moments, lulled and stilled in
<dd>    The shroud by the kirk-chime.
<dt>It is good when it happens," say the children,
<dd>    "That we die before our time."
<p>
<dt>Alas, alas, the children! they are seeking
<dd>    Death in life, as best to have!
<dt>They are binding up their hearts away from breaking,
<dd>    With a cerement from the grave.
<dt>Go out, children, from the mine and from the city,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sing out, children, as the little thrushes do;
<dt>Pluck your handfuls of the meadow-cowslips pretty.
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Laugh aloud, to feel your fingers let them through!
<dt>But they answer, "Are your cowslips of the meadows
<dd>    Like our weeds anear the mine?
<dt>Leave us quiet in the dark of the coal-shadows,
<dd>    From your pleasures fair and fine!
<p>
<dt>"For oh," say the children, "we are weary,
<dd>    And we cannot run or leap;
<dt>If we cared for any meadows, it were merely
<dd>    To drop down in them and sleep.
<dt>Our knees tremble sorely in the stooping,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We fall upon our faces, trying to go;
<dt>And, underneath our heavy eyelids drooping
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The reddest flower would look as pale as snow,
<dt>For, all day, we drag our burden tiring
<dd>    Through the coal-dark, underground;
<dt>Or, all day, we drive the wheels of iron
<dd>    In the factories, round and round.
<p>
<dt>"For all day the wheels are droning, turning;
<dd>    Their wind comes in our faces,
<dt>Till our hearts turn, our heads with pulses burning,
<dd>    And the walls turn in their places;
<dt>Turns the sky in the high window, blank and reeling,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Turns the long light that drops adown the wall,
<dt>Turn the black flies that crawl along the ceiling --
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  All are turning, all the day, and we with all.
<dt>And all day the iron wheels are droning,
<dd>    And sometimes we could pray,
<dt>'O ye wheels' (breaking out in a mad moaning),
<dd>    'Stop! be silent for today!' "
<p>
<dt>Aye, be silent!  Let them hear each other breathing
<dd>    For a moment, mouth to mouth!
<dt>Let them touch each other's hands, in a fresh wreathing
<dd>    Of their tender human youth!
<dt>Let them feel that this cold metallic motion
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Is not all the life God fashions or reveals;
<dt>Let them prove their living souls against the notion
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  That they live in you, or under you, O wheels!
<dt>Still, all day, the iron wheels go onward,
<dd>    Grinding life down  from its mark;
<dt>And the children's souls, which God is calling sunward,
<dd>    Spin on blindly in the dark.
<p>
<dt>Now tell the poor young children, O my brothers,
<dd>    To look up to Him and pray;
<dt>So the blessed One who blesseth all the others,
<dd>    Will bless them another day.
<dt>They answer, "Who is God that He should hear us,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  While the rushing of the iron wheels is stirred?
<dt>When we sob aloud, the human creatures near us
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pass by, hearing not, or answer not a word.
<dt>And <i>we</i> hear not (for the wheels in their resounding)
<dd>    Strangers speaking at the door --
<dt>Is it likely God with angels shining round Him,
<dd>    Hears our weeping any more?
<p>
<dt>"Two words, indeed, of praying we remember,
<dd>    And at midnight's hour of harm,
<dt>'Our Father,' looking upward in the chamber,
<dd>    We say softly for a charm.
<dt>We know no other words except 'Our Father,'
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And we think that, in some pause of angels' song,
<dt>God may pluck them with the silence sweet to gather,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And hold both within His right hand which is strong.
<dt>'Our Father!' If He heard us, He would surely
<dd>    (For they call Him good and mild)
<dt>Answer, smiling down the steep world very purely,
<dd>    'Come and rest with me, my child.'
<p>
<dt>"But, no!" say the children, weeping faster,
<dd>    "He is speechless as a stone;
<dt>And they tell us, of His image is the master
<dd>    Who commands us to work on.
<dt>Go to!" say the children -- "up in Heaven,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Dark, wheellike, turning clouds are all we find.
<dt>Do not mock us; grief has made us unbelieving --
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We look up for God, but tears have made us blind."
<dt>Do you hear the children weeping and disproving,
<dd>    O my brothers, what ye preach?
<dt>For God's possible is taught by His world's loving,
<dd>    And the children doubt of each.
<p>
<dt>And well may the children weep before you!
<dd>    They are weary ere they run;
<dt>They have never seen the sunshine, nor the glory
<dd>    Which is brighter than the sun.
<dt>They know the grief of man, without its wisdom;
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  They sing in man's despair, without its calm;
<dt>Are slaves, with the liberty of Christdom,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Are martyrs, by the pang without the palm;
<dt>Are worn as if with age, yet unretrievingly
<dd>    The harvest of its memories cannot reap --
<dt>Are orphans of the earthly love and heavenly.
<dd>    Let them weep!  let them weep!
<p>
<dt>They look up with their pale and sunken faces,
<dd>    And their look is dread to see,
<dt>For they mind you of their angels in high places,
<dd>    With eyes turned on Deity.
<dt>"How long," they say, "how long, O cruel nation,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Will you stand, to move the world, on a child's heart --
<dt>Stifle down with a mail&egrave;d heel its palpitation,
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And tread onward to your throne amid the mart?
<dt>Our blood splashes upward, O gold-heaper,
<dd>    And your purple shows your path!
<dt>But the child's sob in the silence curses deeper
<dd>    Than the strong man in his wrath."
