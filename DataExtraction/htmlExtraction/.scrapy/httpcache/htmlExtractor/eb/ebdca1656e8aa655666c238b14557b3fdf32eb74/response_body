<H1>Shooting Joan Burroughs</H1> 
<H2>by George Laughead</H2>

<P><B>[Beat Generation writer William S. Burroughs at home in Lawrence,
KS, during 1997. From <I>Beat Fools: James Grauerholz and Me--40 Years of
Weirdness</I>. It all started when I was James Grauerholz's teacher in Fall
1970. He was a freshman student in my "Electronic Media and Society" class, the
first at the University of Kansas to use a William Burroughs book (<I>Nova
Express</I>, 1965) as required reading. James Grauerholz went on to become
William's boy. It has been confusing ever since. William Burroughs died
August 2, 1997.]</B></P>



<P>"Do you believe in UFOs?" William S. Burroughs asked.</P> 

<P>The effect of vodka & Cokes, while already being stoned from the joint
I rolled at William's request - "I'm old - my thumbs don't work" - made
William Burroughs' voice, that most famous low-growling voice, hard to
understand.</P>

<P>We had been talking in William's bedroom while I worked, sitting at his
one-drawer wood desk, looking out at the backyard fishpond and his
Reichian orgone box. The nervousness of being around William increased
due to his reading out loud from Mario Puzo's <I>The Last Don</I>.</P>



<P>"He wanted blood. He cut the guy to pieces. He cut off his cock and
nuts and breasts.... He enjoys doing it and that is very dangerous for the
Family...." </P>

<P>"That's power," William stated, then read on. From William Burroughs'
mouth, Puzo is fucking alarming.</P>

<P>Pointing to a painting on his bedroom wall, he asked, "Do you know who
that is?" The photograph, in the center of William's painting, was of
Samuel Beckett.</P>

<P>"Beckett?" </P>

<P>"Yes. What a writer," William said.</P> 

<P>"Did you ever meet him?" I asked.</P> 

<P>"No, never did." Odd that when William woke-up each day, he looked at
Beckett, hanging over piled-up books. I noticed that the <I>Selected
Letters</I> of Jack Kerouac was on top. So much history in one
corner.* </P>

<P>And books everywhere, cases of books, piles of books. William's
bookshelves, each by a comfortable reading chair, held a range of subjects
and authors. The dining/TV room books seemed to focus on the mystical, in
addition to many versions of William's and his friends' works and
biographies.</P>

<P>Budge's books <I>The Mummy</I> and <I>Ancient Egypt</I>, were on top
with a carved coconut monkey, small gargoyles, potions in bottles, a
cat-type skull, and a small stuffed alligator. The other books included
the Allen Ginsberg biography <I>Dharma Lion</I>, a German-version of
William's <I>Cities of the Red Night</I>, his <I>My Education</I>,
<I>Naked Lunch</I> and others, in different languages, Samuel Beckett's
and Joseph Conrad's biographies, Dr. Timothy Leary's <I>The Game of
Life</I>, and Victor Bockris' <I>Lou Reed</I> biography. Books on guns and
knife magazines and more books.</P>

<P>Back to the question about spacemen. "What?" I nervously asked, now
sitting at his small dining table.</P>

<P>"U F Os," Burroughs yelled. "U F Os. Do you believe in UFOs? I do."</P>

<P>It was March 26, 1997. James Grauerholz, Burroughs' secretary and
editor, was in the kitchen with Daniel Diaz, cooking dinner. Before I
could answer with clich√©s about spacemen, Dan joined us at the small
dining table. He had moved to my house to finish high school, leaving an
abusive parent in St. Louis - a mother that had tried to kill him twice.
William and he talked about what he had been through. </P>



<P>We were in William Burroughs' small two-bedroom red cottage on Learnard
Ave. in Lawrence, Kansas, a university town that James Grauerholz had
moved William years earlier, in 1981. I had been an instructor at the
University of Kansas, and met James when he was my student in the fall of
1970, a freshman from Coffeyville, Kansas. I used Burroughs' <I>Nova
Express</I> as a required text, perhaps the first college class to do so.
James moved to New York in 1974 and started his long relationship with
William.</P>
 
<P>As James continued cooking the green beans and steaks, adding to the
conversation from the kitchen, William repeatedly filled our drinks. He
was in an odd mood, having just found out that week how sick his close
friend Beat poet Allen Ginsberg had become; Allen died two weeks later, on
April 5, 1997. </P>

<P>We had spent a long time with William as he fed his many fish, in two
ponds behind and beside his house. His Reichian 'orgone' box was also
behind the house. Sitting in it for a while, I truly felt nothing, but the
view was unique - William had painted faces on the garage windows facing
the circular opening in the box door. </P>

<P>"SHOOT THE BITCH AND WRITE A BOOK! THAT'S WHAT I DID," William
Burroughs suddenly shouted, standing up fast.</P>

<P>"Did he just say what I think?" I quietly asked Dan and James.</P>

<P>"Yes!" Dan said.</P>

<P>James Grauerholz had a strange look on his face - "It's so out of
character," he quickly added. Not out of character to readers of William
Burroughs, I thought. (Nor to Joan Vollmer Burroughs.)</P>

<P>Later that year, on the 4th of July, James invited me over to William's
for dinner and fireworks. We watched the Mars Rover landing, passed a pipe
and drank some loza brandy that I had brought back that day from Sarajevo,
along with homemade Balkan baklava. </P>

<P>William ate the baklava fast, with delight, although Tom "TP" Peschio
talked him out of immediately drinking my 100 proof brandy gift, along
with his vodka & Cokes. After all, he was 83. Although it was to be
his last month on earth - we didn't know that night.</P>

<P>William looked over the many pictures I had taken of the war damage in
Sarajevo and Dubrovnik. He started remembering Dubrovnik and the woman
that he had married there in 1937. It was a marriage arranged for her to
get out of Nazi-held Europe. A divorce occurred before William began the
ill-fated relationship with Joan Vollmer Burroughs, the relationship that
ended with her death in the infamous "William Tell" shooting in Mexico
City.</P>

<P>"Shoot the bitch and write a book. That's what I did." That still
echoes. Later, Grauerholz denied even hearing the statement, not that I
ever gave a damn whether it was murder or not.* </P>

<P>William Burroughs being a murderer might keep him out of the "Western
Cannon" of literature. This was not something William probably cared
about, as far as I knew. How could a true Beat care about that? James Grauerholz, Burroughs'
adopted son, having inherited all of Burroughs'
copyrights, works hard to move him into the respectable column of writers.
Reformed. Cleaned-up. New image. And you don't get into the "Western
Cannon" if you murder your wife. </P>

<P>But William Burroughs' time, his history, is in the past - he is
already a classic writer, with much of the shock-value gone.  He was truly
a genius and a gentleman.</P>

<P>That 4th of July night, after fireworks in his backyard, William walked
me to the front door in his ritual for saying goodbye to visitors.</P>

<P>"When I visit next," I said, "I'll bring you Bosnian food."</P>

<P>"That would be nice," he quietly said.</P>
 
<P>William Burroughs stood on his porch and waved good-bye as I got into
my van and started to drive away to James Grauerholz's house to stay the
night. I honked my horn once - again, part of the ritual. He stood hunched
over, a little old man. He waved and waved. </P>

<P>It would be the last time I would see William alive. It was a great 4th
of July. Thankful that I knew him, I don't care if William murdered Joan
Vollmer Burroughs or not.</P>
 
<P>"There are no accidents," William Burroughs wrote. "There are no
accidents."</P>
