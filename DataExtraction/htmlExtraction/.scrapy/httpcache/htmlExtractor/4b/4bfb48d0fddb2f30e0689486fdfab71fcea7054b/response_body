<FONT FACE="Imprint MT Shadow" COLOR="#000080"><P>The Sacred Science Institute would like to participate in the current efforts to develop the Glass Bead Game on the Internet by providing those participating in this endeavor with the content necessary for a true rendering of ultimate conception of the game. As many people know, the Glass Bead Game is a term coined by Herman Hesse, in his book  </FONT><A HREF="http://www.sacredscience.com/store/commerce.cgi?product=OTHER"><I><FONT FACE="Imprint MT Shadow">Magister Ludi, The Glass Bead Game (Available Through Seeker's Sanctum, OTHER ITEMS).</I></FONT></A><FONT FACE="Imprint MT Shadow" COLOR="#800080"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Imprint MT Shadow" COLOR="#000080">Hesse explains the game as developing out of musicology and mathematics into a futuristic game woven as a symphony of knowledge and ideas. The game is more or less left to the reader’s imagination with a few hints at sources and influences but with no explanation of how it really works.</P>
<P>We see the Glass Bead Game as a metaphor for a tradition of esoteric philosophical cosmology which has existed throughout every culture known to man. This philosophical cosmology is an expression of the fundamental system of order existent in the universe. These systems of cosmology are usually expressed in symbolic forms such as sacred geometry, alchemy, hieroglyphics, mythology, harmonics, arithmetic, astronomy, magic, and the like, but what they all have in common is a unified vision of the process of manifestation of the universe from the absolute to the relative.</P>
<P>The Glass Bead Game is the artistic, philosophical or cosmological manipulation of the symbolic forms which express these systems of knowledge. These symbolic forms, or what we would call the Glass Beads represent a system of language unknown to all but a few who have searched for or been initiated into this rare and most valuable wisdom. Schwaller de Lubicz called this form of expression "symbolique", or the "Language of the Gods", or the "Language of the Birds". He explains it as a language that uses symbols as letters in an alphabet expressing a unknown language. When one is able to read this language, one can read Egyptian hieroglyphics, Medieval alchemical texts or Gothic cathedrals, and realize that they all say the same thing. He also informs us that there is no way to study "symbolique", but at the same time recommends sacred geometry as the best place to start.</P>
<P>Our intention in creating this Glass Bead Game is to establish a forum and context for the unfolding of this metaphor. It will take some time to lay the groundwork for what is unquestionable the deepest form of expression ever conceived by mankind, or never conceived by mankind as the case may be, but we feel the Internet opens a doorway which has never before existed. In the past esoteric cosmology has been restricted to silent halls of the mystery schools or to the solitary passing of knowledge from teacher to student, or to a selection of rare, abstract texts, some of which are included on this we site. Now, with the Internet, a new forum of mass communication and interaction has been created which foreshadows possibilities never before conceived. We hope to help open this channel of communication to a new direction of exploration.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Imprint MT Shadow" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000080"><P>&nbsp;</FONT><FONT FACE="Imprint MT Shadow" COLOR="#000080">Since the foundation of the Glass Bead Game is the knowledge of which the game is a symphonic integration, we will begin the game by offering some of the rarest and most valuable books and sources for people to prepare to explore this abstract direction. The reader will find at the </FONT><A HREF="http://www.sacredscience.com/"><FONT FACE="Imprint MT Shadow">SACRED SCIENCE INSTITUTE</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Imprint MT Shadow" COLOR="#000080">, hundreds of books in our online store, the </FONT><A HREF="http://www.sacredscience.com/"><FONT FACE="Imprint MT Shadow">SEEKER'S SANCTUM</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Imprint MT Shadow" COLOR="#000080">, and hundreds of original rare, antiquarian books will soon be available through our Antiquarian Department, which support an alternative vision of reality. The direction of this vision is the direction of the Glass Bead Game. We plan over the next six months to expand this selection of materials to several hundred titles, to offer reading lists and suggested courses of study, and to offer and link to knowledge and services which will further lead in this direction. As a supplement to this selection, we recommend that interested persons search the Internet for other references to the Glass Bead Game, where they will find a number of fascinating ideas relating to this new direction.</P>
