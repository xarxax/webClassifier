<P><FONT face="arial,helvetica">Sugar Knowledge International Limited, known throughout the world's sugar industry as <B>SKIL</B>, was established in 1980 to provide consultancy services to the cane sugar sector.  It was intended that advice would be available for both agricultural and factory operations.  From these modest beginnings it has grown into a company providing a broad range of professional services for all aspects of the beet and cane sugar industries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="arial,helvetica">The founders of <B>SKIL</B>, and all the current directors, built their careers working for multinational sugar companies such as Tate + Lyle, Booker and British Sugar.  This ensures that services are provided with a clear understanding of the corporate context including, perhaps most importantly, full commercial awareness.  The company, however, jealously guards its independence from any sugar group and is one of the few truly independent organisations offering professional services to the sugar industry internationally.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="arial,helvetica">It is difficult to identify a single project as typical of the work undertaken by the company because of the diversity shown in the project listings.  The work for PTP XXIV / XXV in Indonesia comes closest because it involves several projects ranging from the initial concept to subsequent expansion.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="arial,helvetica">PTP XXIV / XXV, an Indonesian Government company, appointed <B>SKIL</B> in 1981 to assist in establishing sugar estates in the outer islands.  <B>SKIL</B> oversaw the development and initial operation of two large estates financed by the World Bank and other International Lending Agencies.  <B>SKIL</B> was also retained in later years to assist with their subsequent expansion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="arial,helvetica">Today <B>SKIL</B> is an independent professional services company with the resources necessary to provide consultancy, project engineering, project management and operational management to both the beet and cane sugar industries, including the utilisation of molasses and other by-products.  The company has the flexibility to work with its clients in the way most appropriate to the particular project.  Its clients have the assurance of working with a UK registered company with full Professional Indemnity and Public Liability insurances.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="arial,helvetica">Since its establishment, <B>SKIL</B> has completed projects in most parts of the sugar world and worked with many International Lending Agencies:</FONT></P>
<ul>
<P><FONT face="arial,helvetica"><li> studies for new sugar developments and acquisition of existing operations</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="arial,helvetica"><li> operational reviews and remedial assistance for agricultural, factory and refinery operations</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="arial,helvetica"><li> design and supervision of agricultural and factory refurbishments</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="arial,helvetica"><li> design and project management of new developments and expansions</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="arial,helvetica"><li> training of staff and management both on site and via external visits</FONT></P>
</ul>
<P><FONT face="arial,helvetica">A list of the main projects undertaken is available.</FONT></P>

<H2><FONT face="arial,helvetica" COLOR="#006697" SIZE=4><B>SKIL</B> is steadily expanding its role in the sugar industry, offering a comprehensive range of services:</FONT></H2>
<ul>
<P><FONT face="arial,helvetica"><li> operational consultancy in the field and factory to resolve acute problems and guide their recovery through refurbishment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="arial,helvetica"><li> development planning and conceptual design at both new and existing sites.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="arial,helvetica"><li> assistance with raising of project finance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="arial,helvetica"><li> engineering design and commissioning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="arial,helvetica"><li> contract administration and construction supervision of projects.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="arial,helvetica"><li> operational management of cane sugar estates.</FONT></P>
</ul>
<P><FONT face="arial,helvetica">Most organisations require assistance from time to time, often during projects when work loads peak but also when operational problems arise.  <B>SKIL</B>, recognising this, has responded by ensuring that it is quickly able to offer the appropriate help.</FONT></P>
