</A></I></H2>
<i>Chorus.</i>
<UL><DL>
<dt><font size="+1">C</font>OME we shepherds who have seen
<dt>Day's king deposed by Night's queen.
<dt>Come lift we up our lofty song,
<dt>To wake the Sun that sleeps too long.
<p>
<dt>He in this our general joy,
<dd>  Slept, and dreamt of no such thing
<dt>While we found out the fair-ey'd boy,
<dd>  And kissed the cradle of our king;
<dt>Tell him he rises now too late,
<dt>To show us aught worth looking at.
<p>
<dt>Tell him we now can show him more
<dd>  Than he e'er show'd to mortal sight,
<dt>Than he himself e'er saw before,
<dd>  Which to be seen needs not his light:
<dt>Tell him Tityrus where th' hast been,
<dt>Tell him Thyrsis what th' hast seen.
<p>
</UL></DL>
<i>Tityrus.</i>
<UL><DL>
<dt>Gloomy night embrac'd the place
<dd>  Where the noble infant lay:
<dt>The babe looked up, and show'd his face,
<dd>  In spite of darkness it was day.
<dt>It was thy day, Sweet, and did rise,
<dt>Not from the east, but from thy eyes.
<p>
</UL></DL>
<i>Thyrsis.</i>
<UL><DL>
<dt>Winter chid the world, and sent
<dd>  The angry North to wage his wars:
<dt>The North forgot his fierce intent,
<dd>  And left perfumes, instead of scars:
<dt>By those sweet eyes' persuasive powers,
<dt>Where he meant frosts, he scattered flowers.
<p>
</UL></DL>
<i>Both.</i>
<UL><DL>
<dt>We saw thee in thy balmy nest,
<dd>  Bright dawn of our eternal day;
<dt>We saw thine eyes break from the east,
<dd>  And chase the trembling shades away:
<dt>We saw thee (and we blest the sight)
<dt>We saw thee by thine own sweet light.
<p>
</UL></DL>
<i>Tityrus.</i>
<UL><DL>
<dt>I saw the curl'd drops, soft and slow
<dd>  Come hovering o'er the place's head,
<dt>Offring their whitest sheets of snow,
<dd>  To furnish the fair infant's bed.
<dt>Forbear (said I) be not too bold,
<dt>Your fleect is white, but 'tis too cold.
<p>
</UL></DL>
<i>Thyrsis.</i>
<UL><DL>
<dt>I saw th'officious angels bring,
<dd>  The down that their soft breasts did strow,
<dt>For well they now can spare their wings,
<dd>  When Heaven itself lies here below.
<dt>Fair youth (said I) be not too rough,
<dt>Thy down though soft's not soft enough.
<p>
</UL></DL>
<i>Tityrus.</i>
<UL><DL>
<dt>The babe no sooner 'gan to seek
<dd>  Where to lay his lovely head,
<dt>But straight his eyes advis'd his cheek,
<dd>  'Twixt mother's breasts to go to bed.
<dt>Sweet choice (said I) no way but so,
<dt>Not to lie cold, yet sleep in snow.
<p>
</UL></DL>
<i>Chorus.</i>
<UL><DL>
<dt>Welcome to our wond'ring sight
<dd>  Eternity shut in a span!
<dt>Summer in winter! Day in night!
<dd>  Heaven in Earth! and God in Man!
<dt>Great little one, whose glorious birth,
<dt>Lifts Earth to Heaven, stoops heaven to earth.
<p>
<dt>Welcome, though not to gold, nor silk,
<dd>  To more than C&aelig;sar's birthright is,
<dt>Two sister-seas of virgin's milk,
<dd>  WIth many a rarely-temper'd kiss,
<dt>That breathes at once both maid and mother,
<dt>Warms in the one, cools in the other.
<p>
<dt>She sings thy tears asleep, and dips
<dd>  Her kisses in thy weeping eye,
<dt>She spreads the red leaves of thy lips,
<dd>  That in their buds yet blushing lie.
<dt>She 'gainst those mother diamonds tries
<dt>The points of her young eagle's eyes.
<p>
<dt>Welcome, (though not to those gay flies
<dd>  Guilded i'th' beams of earthly kings
<dt>Slippery souls in smiling eyes)
<dd>  But to poor Shepherds, simple things,
<dt>That use no varnish, no oil'd arts,
<dt>But lift clean hands full of clear hearts.
<p>
<dt>Yet when young April's husband showers
<dd>  Shall bless the fruitful Maia's bed,
<dt>We'll bring the first-born of her flowers,
<dd>  To kiss thy feet, and crown thy head.
<dt>To thee (dread lamb) whose love must keep
<dt>The shepherds, while they feed their sheep.
<p>
<dt>To seek Majesty, soft king
<dd>  Of simple graces, and sweet loves,
<dt>Each of us his lamb will bring,
<dt>Each his pair of silver doves.
<dt>At last, in fire of thy fair eyes,
<dt>We'll burn, our own best sacrifice.

(As she is usually expressed with a Seraphim beside her.)<p>
<UL><DL><P>
<dt><font size="+1">W</font>ELL meaning readers! you that come as friends
<dt>And catch the precious name this piece pretends;
<dt>Make not too much haste to admire
<dt>That fair-cheeked fallacy of fire.
<dt>That is a Seraphim, they say
<dt>And this the great Teresia.
<dt>Readers, be rul'd by me; and make
<dt>Here a well-plac'd and wise mistake
<dt>You must transpose the picture quite,
<dt>And spell it wrong to read it right;
<dt>Read him for her, and her for him;
<dt>And call the saint the Seraphim.
<p>
<dt>Painter, what did'st thou understand
<dt>To put her dart into his hand!
<dt>See, even the years and size of him
<dt>Shows this the mother Seraphim.
<dt>This is the mistress flame; and duteous he
<dt>Her happy fireworks, here comes down to see.
<dt>O most poor-spirited of men!
<dt>Had thy cold pencil kist her pen
<dt>Thou couldst not so unkindly err
<dt>To show us this faint shade for her.
<dt>Why man, this speaks pure mortal frame;
<dt>And mocks with female frost love's manly flame.
<dt>One would suspect, thou meant'st to paint
<dt>Some weak, inferior, woman saint.
<dt>But had thy pale-fac'd purple took
<dt>Fire from the burning cheeks of that bright book
<dt>Thou wouldst on her have leapt up all
<dt>That could be found seraphical;
<dt>Whate'er this youth of fire wears fair,
<dt>Rosy fingers, radiant hair,
<dt>Glowing cheek, and glistering wings,
<dt>All those fair and flagrant things,
<dt>But before all, that fiery dart
<dt>Had fill'd the hand of this great heart.
<p>
<dt>Do then as equal right requires,
<dt>Since his the blushes be, and hers the fires,
<dt>Resume and rectify thy rude design;
<dt>Undress thy Seraphim into mine.
<dt>Redeem this injury of thy art;
<dt>Give him the veil, give her the dart.
<p>
<dt>Give him the veil; that he may cover
<dt>The red cheeks of a rivall'd lover.
<dt>Asham'd that our world, now, can show
<dt>Nests of new Seraphims here below.
<p>
<dt>Give her the dart for it is she
<dt>(Fair youth) shoots both thy shaft and thee.
<dt>Say, all ye wise and well-pierc'd hearts
<dt>That live and die amidst her darts,
<dt>What is't your tasteful spirits do prove
<dt>In that rare life of her, and love?
<dt>Say and bear witness. Sends she not
<dt>A Seraphim at every shot?
<dt>What magazines of immortal arms there shine!
<dt>Heav'n's great artillery in each love-spun line.
<dt>Give then the dart to her who gives the flame;
<dt>Give him the veil, who kindly takes the shame.
<p>
<dt>But if it be the frequent fate
<dt>Of worst faults to be fortunate;
<dt>If all's prescription; and proud wrong
<dt>Hearkens not to an humble song;
<dt>For all the gallantry of him,
<dt>Give me the suff'ring Seraphim.
<dt>His be the bravery of all those bright things,
<dt>The glowing cheeks, the glistering wings;
<dt>The rosy hand, the radiant dart;
<dt>Leave her alone, the Flaming Heart.
<p>
<dt>Leave her that; and thou shalt leave her
<dt>Not one loose shaft but love's whole quiver.
<dt>For in love's field was never found
<dt>A nobler weapon than a wound.
<dt>Love's passives are his activ'st part.
<dt>The wounded is the wounding heart.
<dt>O heart! the equal poise of love's both parts
<dt>Big alike with wound and darts.
<dt>Live in these conquering leaves; live all the same;
<dt>And walk through all tongues one triumphant flame.
<dt>Live here, great heart; and love and die and kill;
<dt>And bleed and wound; and yield and conquer still.
<dt>Let this immortal life where'er it comes
<dt>Walk in a crowd of loves and martyrdoms.
<dt>Let mystic deaths wait on't; and wise souls be
<dt>The love-slain witnesses of this life of thee.
<dt>O sweet incendiary! show here thy art,
<dt>Upon this carcass of a hard, cold heart,
<dt>Let all thy scatter'd shafts of light, that play
<dt>Among the leaves of thy large books of day,
<dt>Combined against this breast at once break in
<dt>And take away from me my self and sin,
<dt>This gracious robbery shall thy bounty be;
<dt>And my best fortunes such fair spoils of me.
<dt>O thou undaunted daughter of desires!
<dt>By all thy dow'r of lights and fires;
<dt>By all the eagle in thee, all the dove;
<dt>By all thy lives and deaths of love;
<dt>By thy large draughts of intellectual day,
<dt>And by thy thirsts of love more large than they;
<dt>By all thy brim-fill'd bowls of fierce desire
<dt>By the last morning's draught of liquid fire;
<dt>By the full kingdom of that final kiss
<dt>That seiz'd thy parting soul, and seal'd thee his;
<dt>By all the heav'ns thou hast in him
<dt>(Fair sister of the Seraphim!)
<dt>By all of him we have in thee;
<dt>Leave nothing of my self in me.
<dt>Let me so read thy life, that I
<dt>Unto all life of mine may die.

<UL><DL><P>
<dt><font size="+1">W</font>HOE'ER she be,
<dt>That not impossible she
<dt>That shall command my heart and me;
<p>
<dt>Where'er she lie,
<dt>Lock'd up from mortal Eye,
<dt>In shady leaves of Destiny:
<p>
<dt>Till that ripe Birth
<dt>Of studied fate stand forth,
<dt>And teach her fair steps to our Earth;
<p>
<dt>Till that divine
<dt>Idea, take a shrine
<dt>Of crystal flesh, through which to shine:
<p>
<dt>Meet you her my wishes,
<dt>Bespeak her to my blisses,
<dt>And be ye call'd my absent kisses.
<p>
<dt>I wish her beauty,
<dt>That owes not all his duty
<dt>To gaudy tire, or glist'ring shoe-tie.
<p>
<dt>Something more than
<dt>Taffeta or tissue can,
<dt>Or rampant feather, or rich fan.
<p>
<dt>More than  the spoil
<dt>Of shop, or silkworm's toil
<dt>Or a bought blush, or a set smile.
<p>
<dt>A face that's best
<dt>By its own beauty drest,
<dt>And can alone commend the rest.
<p>
<dt>A face made up
<dt>Out of no other shop,
<dt>Than what nature's white hand sets ope.
<p>
<dt>A cheek where youth,
<dt>And blood, with pen of truth
<dt>Write, what the reader sweetly ru'th.
<p>
<dt>A cheek where grows
<dt>More than a morning rose:
<dt>Which no box his being owes.
<p>
<dt>Lips, where all day
<dt>A lover's kiss may play,
<dt>Yet carry nothing thence away.
<p>
<dt>Looks that oppress
<dt>Their richest tires but dress
<dt>And clothe their simplest nakedness.
<p>
<dt>Eyes, that displaces
<dt>The neighbour diamond, and outfaces
<dt>That sunshine by ther own sweet graces.
<p>
<dt>Tresses, that wear
<dt>Jewels, but to declare
<dt>How much themselves more precious are.
<p>
<dt>Whose native ray,
<dt>Can tame the wanton day
<dt>Of gems, that in their bright shades play.
<p>
<dt>Each ruby there,
<dt>Or pearl that dare appear,
<dt>Be its own blush, be its own tear.
<p>
<dt>A well tam'd heart,
<dt>For whose more noble smart,
<dt>Love may be long choosing a dart.
<p>
<dt>Eyes, that bestow
<dt>Full quivers on love's bow;
<dt>Yet pay less arrows than they owe.
<p>
<dt>Smiles, that can warm
<dt>The blood, yet teach a charm,
<dt>That chastity shall take no harm.
<p>
<dt>Blushes, that bin
<dt>The burnish of no sin,
<dt>Nor flames of aught too hot within.
<p>
<dt>Joys, that confess,
<dt>Virtue their mistress,
<dt>And have no other head to dress.
<p>
<dt>Fears, fond and flight,
<dt>As the coy bride's, when night
<dt>First does the longing lover right.
<p>
<dt>Tears, quickly fled,
<dt>And vain, as those are shed
<dt>For a dying maidenhead.
<p>
<dt>Days, that need borrow,
<dt>No part of their good morrow,
<dt>From a forespent night of sorrow.
<p>
<dt>Days, that in spite
<dt>Of darkness, by the light
<dt>Of a clear mind are day all night.
<p>
<dt>Nights, sweet as they,
<dt>Made short by lovers' play,
<dt>Yet long by th' absence of the day.
<p>
<dt>Life, that dares send
<dt>A challenge to his end,
<dt>And when it comes say <i>Welcome friend.</i>
<p>
<dt>Sidneyan showers
<dt>Of sweet discourse, whose powers
<dt>Can crown old winter's head with flowers,
<p>
<dt>Soft silken hours,
<dt>Open suns; shady bowers,
<dt>'Bove all: Nothing within that lowers.
<p>
<dt>Whate'er delight
<dt>Can make day's forehead bright;
<dt>Or give down to the wings of night.
<p>
<dt>In her whole frame,
<dt>Have nature all the name,
<dt>Art and ornament the shame.
<p>
<dt>Her flattery,
<dt>Picture and poesy,
<dt>Her counsel her own virtue be.
<p>
<dt>I wish, her store
<dt>Of worth, may leave her poor
<dt>Of wishes; And I wish -- no more.
<p>
<dt>Now if time knows
<dt>That her whose radiant brows,
<dt>Weave them a garland of my vows;
<p>
<dt>Her whose just bays,
<dt>My future hopes can raise,
<dt>A trophy to her present praise;
<p>
<dt>Her that dares be,
<dt>What thse lines wish to see:
<dt>I seek no further, it is she.
<p>
<dt>'Tis she, and here
<dt>Lo I unclothe and clear,
<dt>My wishes' cloudy character.
<p>
<dt>May she enjoy it,
<dt>Whose merit dare apply it,
<dt>But modesty dares still deny it.
<p>
<dt>Such worth as this is,
<dt>Shall fix my flying wishes,
<dt>And determine them to kisses.

<H2><IMG SRC="marker2.gif"><I><A name="5"> <font color="#004080">Music's Duel</font></A></I></H2>
<UL><DL><P>
<dt><font size="+1">N</font>OW Westward <i>Sol</i> had spent the richest Beams
<dt>Of Noon's high Glory, when hard by the streams
<dt>Of <i>Tiber</i>, on the scene of a green plat,
<dt>Under protection an an Oak, there sat
<dt>A sweet Lute's-master, in whose gentle aires
<dt>He lost the Day's heat, and his own hot cares.
<dd>  Close in the covert of the leaves there stood
<dt>A Nightingale, come from the neighboring wood:
<dt>(The sweet inhabitant of each glad Tree,
<dt>Their Muse, their <i>Syren</i>, harmless <i>Syren</i> she)
<dt>There stood she list'ning, and did entertain
<dt>The Music's soft report, and mold the same
<dt>In her own murmurs, that what ever mood
<dt>His curious fingers lent, her voice made good;
<dt>The man preceiv'd his Rival, and her Art,
<dt>Dispos'd to give the light-foot Lady sport
<dt>Awakes his Lute, and 'gainst the fight to come
<dt>Informs it, in a sweet <i>Praeludium</i>
<dt>Of closer strains, and ere the war begin,
<dt>He lightly skirmishes on every string
<dt>Char'd with a flying touch; and staightway she
<dt>Carves out her dainty voice as readily,
<dt>Into a thousand sweet distinguish'd Tones,
<dt>And reckons up in soft divisions,
<dt>Quick volumes of wild Notes, to let him know
<dt>By that shrill taste, she could do something, too.
<dd>  His nimble hands instinct then taught each string
<dt>A cap'ring cheerfulness, and made them sing
<dt>Toi their own dance; now negligently rash
<dt>He throws his Arm, and with a long-drawn dash
<dt>Blends all together; then distinctly trips
<dt>>From this to that; then quick returning skips
<dt>And snatches this again, and pauses there.
<dt>She measures every measure, every where
<dt>Meets art with art; sometimes as if in doubt
<dt>Not perfect yet, and fearing to be out
<dt>Trails her plain Ditty in one long-spun note,
<dt>Through the sleek passage of her open throat;
<dt>A clear unwrinckled song, then doth she point it
<dt>With tender accents, and severely joint it
<dt>By short diminutives, that being rear'd
<dt>In controverting warbles evenly shar'd,
<dt>With her sweet self she wrangles; He amaz'd
<dt>That from so small a channel should be rais'd
<dt>The torrent of a voice, whose melody
<dt>Could melt into such sweet variety
<dt>Strains higher yet; that tickled with rare art
<dt>The tatling strings (each breathing in his part)
<dt>Most kindly do fall out; the grumbling Base
<dt>In surly groans disdains the Treble's Grace.
<dt>The high-perch'd Treble chirps at this, and chides,
<dt>Until his finger (Moderator) hides
<dt>And closes the sweet quarrel, rousing all
<dt>Hoarse, shrill, at once; as when the Trumpets call
<dt>Hot Mars to th'Harvest of Death's Field, and woo
<dt>Men's hearts into their hands; this lesson too
<dt>She gives him back; her supple Breast thrills out
<dt>Sharp Aires, and staggers in a warbling doubt
<dt>Of dallying sweetness, hovers o"er her skillk,
<dt>And folds in wav'd notes with a trembling bill,
<dt>The pliant Series of her slippery song.
<dt>Then starts she suddenly into a Throng
<dt>Of short thick sobs, whose thund'ring volleys float,
<dt>And roll themselves over her lubrick throat.
<dt>In panting murmurs, 'still'd out of her Breast
<dt>That ever-bubbling spring; the sugar'd Nest
<dt>Of her delicious soul, that there does lie
<dt>Bathing in streams of liquid Melody;
<dt>Music's best seed-plot, whenced in ripen'd Aires
<dt>A Golden-headed Harvest fairly rears
<dt>His Honey-dripping tops, plow'd by her breath
<dt>Which there reciprocally laboreth
<dt>In that sweet soil.  It seems a holy choir
<dt>Founded to th' Name of great <i>Apollo's</i> lyre.
<dt>Whose silver-roof rings with the sprightly notes
<dt>Of sweet-lipp'd Angel-Imps, that swill their throats
<dt>In cream of Morning <i>Helicon</i>, and then
<dt>Prefer soft Anthems to the Ears of men,
<dt>To woo them from their Beds, still murmuring
<dt>That men can sleep while they their Matins sing:
<dt>(Most divine service) whose so early lay
<dt>Prevents the Eye-lids of the blushing Day.
<dt>There might you hear her kindle her soft voice,
<dt>In the close murmur of a sparkling noise.
<dt>And lay the ground-work of her hopeful song,
<dt>Still keeping in the forward stream, so long
<dt>Till a sweet whirl-wind (striving to get out)
<dt>Heaves her soft Bosom, wanders round about,
<dt>And makes a pretty Earthquake in her Breast,
<dt>Till the fledg'd Notes at length forsake their Nest;
<dt>Fluttering in wanton shoals, and to the Sky
<dt>Wing'd with their own wild Echo's prattling fly.
<dt>She opes the floodgate, and lets loose a Tide
<dt>Of streaming sweetness, which in state doth ride
<dt>On the wav'd back of every swelling strain,
<dt>Rising and falling in a pompous train.
<dt>And while she thus discharges a shrill peal
<dt>Of flashing Aires, she qualifies their zeal
<dt>With the cool Epode of a graver Note,
<dt>Thus high, thus low, as if her silver throat
<dt>Would reach the brazen voice of War's hoarse Bird;
<dt>Her little soul is ravisht, and so pour'd
<dt>Into loose ecstasies, that she is plac't
<dt>Above her self, Music's <i>Enthusiast</i>.
<dd>  Shame now and anger mixt a double stain
<dt>In the Musician's face: "Yet once again
<dt>(Mistress) I come; now reach a strain my Lute
<dt>Above her mock, or be for ever mute.
<dt>Or tune a song of victory to me,
<dt>Or to thy self, sing thine own Obsequy."
<dt>So said, his hands sprightly as fire he flings,
<dt>And with a quavering coyness tastes the strings.
<dt>The sweet-lipp'd sisters musically frighted,
<dt>Singing their fears are fearfully delighted.
<dt>Trembling as when <i>Apollo's</i> golden hairs
<dt>Are fann'd and frizzled, in the wanton aires
<dt>Of his own breath, which married to his Lyre
<dt>Doth tune the <i>Spheres</i>, and make Heav'n's self look higher.
<dt>>From this to that, from that to this he flies
<dt>Feels Music's pulse in all her Arteries,
<dt>Caught in a net which there <i>Apollo</i> spreads,
<dt>His fingers struggle with the vocal threads,
<dt>Following those little rills, he sinks into
<dt>A Sea of <i>Helicon</i>; his hand does go
<dt>Those parts of sweetness which with <i>Nectar</i> drop,
<dt>Softer than that which pants in <i>Hebe's</i> cup.
<dt>The humourous strings expound his learned touch,
<dt>By various Glosses; now they seem to grutch,
<dt>And murmur in a buzzing din, then jingle
<dt>In shrill-tongu'd accents, striving to be single.
<dt>Every smooth turn, every delicious stroke
<dt>Gives life to some new Grace; thus doth h'invoke
<dt>Sweetness by all her Names; thus, bravely thus
<dt>(Fraught with a fury so harmonious)
<dt>The Lute's light <i>Genius</i> now does proudly rise,
<dt>Heav'd on the surges of swoll'n Rhapsodies.
<dt>Whose flourish (Meteor-like) doth curl the air
<dt>With flash of high-borne fancies; here and there
<dt>Dancing in lofty measures, and anon
<dt>Creeps on the soft touch of a tender tone,
<dt>Who trembling murmurs melting in wild aires
<dt>Runs to and fro, complaining his sweet cares
<dt>Because those precious mysteries that dwell,
<dt>In Music's ravish't soul he dare not tell,
<dt>But whisper to the world; thus do they vary
<dt>Each string his Note, as if they meant to carry
<dt>Their Master's blest soul (snatcht out at his Ears
<dt>By a strong Ecstacy) through all the spheres
<dt>Of Music's heaven; and seat it there on high
<dt>In th'<i>Empyraeum</i> of pure Harmony.
<dt>At length (after so long, so loud a strife
<dt>Of all the strings, still breathing the best life
<dt>Of blest variety attending on
<dt>His fingers' fairest revolution
<dt>In many a sweet rise, many as sweet a fall)
<dt>A full-mouth <i>Diapason</i> swallows all.
<dd> This done, he list what she would say to this,
<dt>And she, although her Breath's late exercise
<dt>Had dealt too roughly with her tender throat,
<dt>Yet summons all her sweet powers for a Note
<dt>Alas! in vain! for while (sweet soul) she tries
<dt>To measure all those wild diversities
<dt>Of chatt'ring strings, by the small size of one
<dt>Poor simple voice, rais'd in a Natural Tone,
<dt>She fails, and failing grieves, and grieving dies.
<dt>She dies, and leaves her life the Victor's prize,
<dt>Falling upon his Lute; O fit to have
<dt>(That liv'd so sweetly) dead, so sweet a Grave!
