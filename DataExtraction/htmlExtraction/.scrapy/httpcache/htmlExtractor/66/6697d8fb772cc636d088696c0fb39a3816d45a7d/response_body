<h4>Anonymous Speech</h4>
<br />

<p>
COMRADES: the world is built upon our dead
<br />
and our feet have created all the roads.
<br />
Also, beneath every sky, there is not an inch of shadow
<br />
for those of us who made the cupolas bloom.
<br />
<br />
Bread, blonde grandchild of the sower, a roof
<br />
- foliage of clay and sun that shelters the family - ,
<br />
the right to love and walk freely are not ours:
<br />
we are the slave traders of our own lives.
<br />
<br />
Happiness, that sea we&#8217;ve never seen,
<br />
the cities we&#8217;ll never visit
<br />
we lift up in our clenched fists like fruit,
<br />
announcing the most serious harvest of all time.
<br />
<br />
Only the right to die, comrades of the world!
<br />
A hundred hands divide the offerings of the earth.
<br />
Already the time has come to hurl ourselves into the streets and plazas
<br />
to reclaim the Work we ourselves built.

<h4>Biography for the Use of Birds</h4>
<br />

<p>I was born in the century of the death of the rose
<br />
when the motor had already driven out the angels.
<br />
Quito watched as the last stagecoach rolled away,
<br />
and at its passing trees ran by in perfect order,
<br />
and also hedges and houses of new parishes,
<br />
at the threshold of the countryside
<br />
where cows were slowly chewing silence
<br />
as wind spurred on its swift horses.
<br />
<br />
My mother, clothed in the setting sun,
<br />
stored her youth deep in a guitar
<br />
and only on certain evenings would she show it to her children,
<br />
wrapped in music, light, and words.
<br />
I loved the hydrography of rain,
<br />
 yellow fleas on apple trees,
<br />
and toads that rang two or three times
<br />
their thick wooden bells.
<br />
<br />
The great sail of the air manuevered endlessly.
<br />
The cordillera was a shore of the sky.
<br />
A storm came, and as drums rolled
<br />
its drenched regiments charged;
<br />
but then the sun&#8217;s golden patrols
<br />
restored translucent peace to the fields.
<br />
I watched men embrace barley,
<br />
horsemen sink into sky,
<br />
and laden wagons pulled by lowing oxen
<br />
travel down to the mango-fragrant coast.
<br />
<br />
There was a valley with farms
<br />
where dawn set off a trickle of roosters,
<br />
and to the west was a land where sugarcane
<br />
waved its peaceful banner, and cacao trees
<br />
stored in coffers their secret fortunes,
<br />
and the pineapple girded on its fragrant cuirass,
<br />
the nude banana its silken tunic.
<br />
<br />
It has all passed, in successive waves,
<br />
just as the useless ciphers of sea foam pass.
<br />
Entangled in seaweed, the years went by slowly
<br />
as memory became scarcely a water-lily,
<br />
its drowned face
<br />
looming up between two waters.
<br />
The guitar is only a coffin for songs
<br />
as the cock with its head wound laments
<br />
and all the earth&#8217;s angels have emigrated,
<br />
even the dark brown angel of the cacao tree
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h4>Sunday</h4>
<br />

<p>Fruit seller church
<br />
seated at the corner of life:
<br />
crystal orange windows,
<br />
the sugar cane organ.
<br />
<br />
Angels: little chicks
<br />
of Mother Mary.
<br />
<br />
The blue-eyed bell
<br />
wanders off on bare feet
<br />
throughout the countryside.
<br />
<br />
Sun clock:
<br />
angelic burro with its innocent sex;
<br />
wind, in Sunday best,
<br />
bringing news from the mountains.
<br />
<br />
Indian women with loads of vegetables
<br />
embracing foreheads.
<br />
<br />
The sky rolls up its eyes
<br />
when it sees the church bell
<br />
run barefoot from the church.
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h4>Ecuadorian Man under the Eiffel Tower</h4>
<br />

<p>
You turn into a plant on the coasts of time.
<br />
With a chalice of round sky
<br />
and tunnel for traffic,
<br />
you are the largest ceiba tree on earth.
<br />
<br />
The painter&#8217;s eye climbs up
<br />
through your scissor-stairs to blue.
<br />
Over a flock of roofs you stretch your neck
<br />
like a llama of Peru.
<br />
<br />
Robed in folds of wind,
<br />
with an ornamental comb of constellations,
<br />
you loom over
<br />
the circus of the horizon.
<br />
<br />
Mast of an adventure upon time!
<br />
<br />
Pride of five hundred and thirty cubits.
<br />
<br />
Pole of the tent raised by men
<br />
in a corner of history.
<br />
With gaseous lights your sketch in the night
<br />
reproduces the Milky Way.
<br />
<br />
First letter of a cosmic Alphabet,
<br />
pointing towards sky,
<br />
hope standing on stilts,
<br />
a glorified skeleton.
<br />
<br />
Iron that brands a flock of clouds,
<br />
mute sentinel of an Industrial Age.
<br />
<br />
The tides of heaven
<br />
silently undermine your column.
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h4>Nothing</h4>
<br />

<p>
In bookstores there are no books,
<br />
in books no words,
<br />
in words no essence:
<br />
there are only husks.
<br />
<br />
In museums and waiting rooms
<br />
are painted canvases and fetishes.
<br />
In the Academy there are only recordings
<br />
of the wildest dances.
<br />
<br />
In mouths there is only smoke,
<br />
in the eyes only distance.
<br />
There is a drum in each ear.
<br />
A Sahara yawns in the mind.
<br />
<br />
Nothing frees us from the desert.
<br />
Nothing saves us from the drum.
<br />
Painted books shed their pages,
<br />
becoming husks of Nothing.
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h4>Power Of The Word</h4>
<br />

<p>
You, panther and statue, angel of fruit,
<br />
sexual bread shop, monument of wheat,
<br />
with throat pierced by the dart
<br />
of a sudden word, have fallen into shadows.
<br />
<br />
Oh deadly and fiery word that arrives
<br />
to engrave itself so accurately in marble,
<br />
like the rifle that blindly strikes down
<br />
the soldier from a distance.
<br />
<br />
Panther of wheat, you now lie like
<br />
a toppled statue on an empty beach.
<br />
The sea foam of oblivion washes up around you -
<br />
 O prone pillars where doves nest!
<br />
<br />
Blue lightning of the word
<br />
has scattered your useless wings and fruit,
<br />
and, in shadows, your abandoned body is
<br />
a frigid bread shop washed out by the moon.
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h4>Sketch Of Contemporary Man</h4>
<br />

<p>
The world is covered with cradles
<br />
that sing in the night.
<br />
<br />
Man lives accumulating blocks of stone
<br />
for the houses of the future man.
<br />
<br />
Weighed down by climates,
<br />
making his way among towers, chimneys and antennae,
<br />
a traveler each day in his own city,
<br />
he is shipwrecked by five o&#8217;clock
<br />
among an electric vegetation of advertisements.
<br />
<br />
Master of machines,
<br />
he lives in skyscrapers.
<br />
You are in the North, South, East and West:
<br />
white man, yellow man, black man.
<br />
<br />
In his hands bloom
<br />
itineraries of boats and trains.
<br />
Nourished by newspapers
<br />
mornings are summed up in his eyes.
<br />
<br />
The railroad plows through the earth,
<br />
turning up shavings of landscapes;
<br />
piloted by the man with perfect hands
<br />
an airplane rises against the geography.
<br />
<br />
Man shouts
<br />
in Mexico and Berlin, in Moscow and Buenos Aires
<br />
as his telegrams cover the planet.
<br />
<br />
This is the landscape of our night:
<br />
the city girds on its belt of trains,
<br />
as searchlights extend their snail&#8217;s antenna
<br />
and an airplane, a celestial shipwreck, descends.
<br />
<br />
Man, inventor of the future, arises
<br />
surrounded by machines,
<br />
posters of Lenin, street plans of New York
<br />
and panoramas of the world.

<h4>Loneliness of Cities</h4>
<br />

<p>
Without knowing my number,
<br />
enclosed by walls and borders,
<br />
I walk around with a prisoner&#8217;s moon
<br />
and perpetual shadow chained to my ankle.
<br />
<br />
Living frontiers arise
<br />
a step beyond my footsteps.
<br />
<br />
There is neither north nor south, east or west,
<br />
only a multiplied loneliness exists,
<br />
a loneliness divided by a cipher of men.
<br />
Time&#8217;s race around the circus of the clock,
<br />
luminous navels of streetcars,
<br />
bells with athletic shoulders,
<br />
walls that spell out two or three colored words,
<br />
are the materials of loneliness.
<br />
<br />
Image of solitude:
<br />
bricklayer singing on a scaffold,
<br />
fixed raft in the sky.
<br />
Images of solitude:
<br />
a traveler submerged in a newspaper,
<br />
a waiter hiding a photograph in his vest pocket.
<br />
<br />
The city has a mineral appearance.
<br />
Urban geometry is less beautiful
<br />
than the geometry we learned at school.
<br />
A triangle, egg, cube of sugar
<br />
initiated us into a celebration of forms.
<br />
Circumferences only came later:
<br />
the first woman, and the first moon.
<br />
<br />
Where were you, loneliness,
<br />
that I never knew you before I turned twenty?
<br />
On trains, in mirrors, in photographs,
<br />
you are always at my side now.
<br />
<br />
Country people are less alone
<br />
because they are one with the land:
<br />
trees are their sons,
<br />
they see weather changes in their own flesh,
<br />
and are taught by the saints&#8217; calendar of little animals.
<br />
<br />
This solitude is nourished by books,
<br />
solitary walks, pianos, and fragments of crowds,
<br />
by cities and skies conquered by machines,
<br />
sheets of foam
<br />
unfolding toward the limits of the seas.
<br />
Everything has been invented,
<br />
but nothing has been invented to deliver us from loneliness.
<br />
<br />
Playing cards guard the secret of garrets,
<br />
sobs are formed to be smoked away in a pipe,
<br />
and there have been attempts to inter solitude in a guitar.
<br />
It&#8217;s known that loneliness walks through vacant apartments,
<br />
has commerce with the clothing of suicides,
<br />
and confuses messages in the telegraph wires.
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h4>Biography</h4>
<br />

<p>
The window born of a desire for sky
<br />
has stationed itself in the black wall like an angel:
<br />
it&#8217;s friend to man,
<br />
a carrier of air.
<br />
<br />
It converses with pools of the earth,
<br />
with childlike mirrors of houses,
<br />
and tiled roofs on strike.
<br />
<br />
From high up, windows,
<br />
with their diaphanous diatribes,
<br />
face the multitudes.
<br />
<br />
The maestro window
<br />
diffuses its light into the night.
<br />
It extracts the square root of a meteor,
<br />
totals columns of constellations.
<br />
<br />
The window is the gunwale of earth&#8217;s ship;
<br />
a surf of clouds peacefully surrounds it.
<br />
The captain Spirit, eyes washed
<br />
by blue tempests, searches for the island of God.
<br />
<br />
The window distributes to everyone
<br />
a quart of light, a bucket of air.
<br />
The window, plowed by clouds,
<br />
is the small property of the sky.

<h4>The Return Journey</h4>
<br />

<p>
My life was a geography
<br />
I surveyed over and over again,
<br />
a book of maps or dreams.
<br />
In America I awakened.
<br />
<br />
Were these perhaps dreams of rivers and towns?
<br />
Was there nothing real about these countries?
<br />
Are there three steps in my journey:
<br />
dreaming, waking, and dying?
<br />
<br />
I&#8217;ve fallen asleep among statues
<br />
and upon waking found myself alone.
<br />
Where are the benevolent shadows?
<br />
Did I love and in truth was I loved?
<br />
<br />
It was a geography of dream,
<br />
a magical history.
<br />
I know by memory the islands and faces
<br />
visited or, perhaps, dreamed.
<br />
<br />
Upon the spoils of the universe
<br />
- fruit, woman, the immensity -
<br />
fell all of my inebriated senses,
<br />
like drunken pirates of the sea.
<br />
<br />
At last I found in harbor,
<br />
a naked girl, perfectly shaped:
<br />
in her great, tremulous water
<br />
I quenched my human thirst.
<br />
<br />
Later came the maiden of wheat,
<br />
the vegetal virgin;
<br />
but, always, from each door
<br />
the eternal Other called me.
<br />
<br />
From snow to palm tree
<br />
I saw cities of the earth
<br />
where God had cleaned the windows
<br />
and no one wanted to die.
<br />
<br />
I saw the arid earth of the bull
<br />
- last refuge of blue -
<br />
and a country where pine trees
<br />
raised their green obelisks to the light.
<br />
<br />
Did I dream this face on the wall,
<br />
that hand upon my skin?
<br />
This street of apples
<br />
and doves, did I dream it all?
<br />
<br />
The harbor like equal sections
<br />
of a crystal watermelon,
<br />
and islands like seeds:
<br />
was this a dream and nothing more?
<br />
<br />
Is this dust the mortal ash
<br />
that still clings to my feet?
<br />
Were they not harbors but years,
<br />
those places I anchored in?
<br />
<br />
Only in the most distinct languages
<br />
did I become fluent in solitude
<br />
and graduated as a doctor of dreams.
<br />
I came to America to awake.
<br />
<br />
Again, in my throat burns
<br />
the thirst to live, the thirst to die,
<br />
and so I humbly bend down
<br />
to this earth of maize.
<br />
<br />
Land of fruit and tombs,
<br />
sole property of the sun:
<br />
I come from the world - O great dream! -
<br />
with a map scrolled in my voice.
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h4>A Dream Of Farmhouses</h4>
<br />

<p>
My shadow, penetrated by dewy pastures,
<br />
by constellations imprisoned in farmhouses,
<br />
the breathing of sleeping men
<br />
in their temporary tombs,
<br />
advances down a road that discovers horizons.
<br />
The cosmic anguish of frogs pierces me,
<br />
the metaphysical frogs that converse with stars.
<br />
Each frog, counterfeiter of silence,
<br />
loses, one by one,
<br />
its copper coins.
<br />
<br />
Beneath the mountain is a nude river
<br />
like an archangel in its crystal suit of armor.
<br />
Listen: the horse lifts iron hooves
<br />
and with slow dance-like movements
<br />
plunges into the water of dreams.
<br />
<br />
Beloved land: I feel you living inside me
<br />
with the totality of your shapes and beings.
<br />
The murmur of your trees circulates among my bones.
<br />
While everything around me sleeps,
<br />
I work like a bee in the hive of the spirit.
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h4>Indian Rebellion</h4>
<br />

<p>
Refracted into brilliance,
<br />
last candles hiss
<br />
in the mountain&#8217;s rainy mist.
<br />
<br />
Village Indians carry sunrise
<br />
on the blades of their sickles
<br />
into the lowlands.
<br />
<br />
In steam from mountain ponchos,
<br />
the color of apples,
<br />
flutter birds and voices.
<br />
<br />
Wind from the highlands
<br />
descends in concave brims of hats
<br />
toward the lowlands, fat with sheaves.
<br />
<br />
In carts of air
<br />
mule driver roads carry clusters of songs
<br />
through the night.
<br />
<br />
The Indian rebellion carries morning
<br />
in the protest of their shovels.
