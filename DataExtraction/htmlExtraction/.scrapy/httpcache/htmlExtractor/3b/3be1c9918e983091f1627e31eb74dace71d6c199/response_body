Thank you for stopping by at our Franz Kafka site.
This site is a project started by participants of the spring 1996 
Franz-Kafka graduate seminar taught by Dr. Clark Muenzer at the <A 
HREF="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/german.html">German department</A> of the 
<A 
HREF="http://www.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh</A>.
<P>

We haven't had the time to apply a lot of changes lately, neither have we
answered a lot of the email we've received. I hope that this will change
soon - let's say my March 1998 there should be new material on this
site...
<P>

<H3>We offer:</H3><br>

We appreciate any comments

you can send us an e-mail 
from every page of our site. 
And here are some of the 
comments we received from 
people like you (the ones 
we liked most and the ones 
we despised most):

<b>Why is this site<br>
predominantly in<br>
English?</b><p>

The <b>real</b> answer to the above question is that by using English we
can serve the most people on the Internet. Period.<P>

Kafka is internationally known, and you wouldn't believe from which parts
of the world we receive desperate mails from people who seek help on a
paper on Franz Kafka! (Sorry, we are only students ourselves and no
experts on Kafka, really, and we have our own papers to write, so we
cannot help you more than we have done, presumably, by creating and
maintaining this site! And we are unable to host a Kafka listserv
mailinglist as well, even though we think that people would be
interested.)<p>

Anyway, the text we had here initially about Kafka not being a German
author fueled some interesting comments which can be found (together with
the old text) on the <A
HREF="http://www.pitt.edu/~kafka/comments.html">comments-page</A>.<P>
