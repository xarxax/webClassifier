								<B>WHAT WE DO</B>
								<br>
								We are a service oriented union metal fabrication shop that is qualified and 
								equipped to fabricate and/or install many different types of sheet and plate, 
								including but not limited to: stainless and carbon steels, aluminum and 
								structural steel.
								<br>
								<br>
								<B>WHO WE SERVE</B>
								<br>
								The majority of our customers are located within a 100 mile radius, but we have 
								done work as far away as Indiana. We obtain most of our work from the many 
								paper mills in the immediate area, steel mills, foundries, aluminum producers, 
								grain processors, general contractors, engineering firms, truck manufacturers, 
								and breweries. References available upon request.
								<br>
								<br>
								<B>OUR EMPLOYEES AND STAFF</B>
								<br>
								We take pride in the fact that we are able to employ a full time crew of highly 
								skilled craftsmen, most of which have been with us at least 10 years. In 
								addition, our supervisory people have all been with us 20 or more years.
								<br>
								<br>
								<B>EQUIPMENT AND CAPACITIES</B>
								<br>
								We are able to shear and form sheet and plate from 24 gauge to &frac12;" thick 
								by twenty feet long. We have four rolling machines that range from three feet 
								by 24 gauge to ten feet by &frac12;" mild steel. We can roll thicker plate, but 
								it is dependent upon width and radius. Our programmable cutting machine has an 
								eight foot by twenty foot table that can plasma 24 gauge through 2" stainless 
								and carbon steel and flame cut up to 6" plate. It also has a pneumatic marker 
								that can mark hole centers and break lines. In addition, our program enables us 
								to cut parts from your <a href="mailto:salesoffice@rjmetalfab.com">emailed</a> drawings 
								or make CAD drawings from your prints or hand sketches. We have an assortment 
								of saws that include cutoff, contour and miter. Our automatic cut off saw has a 
								capacity of 16"X 12". Our power punches go up to 70 ton, and we also have a multitude
                                                                of beam punches, pipe copers, and notchers.
								<br>
								<br>
								We are able to do most types of welding in our shop and in the field, including 
								TIG, MIG and stick. We also have city certified welders available to meet your 
								needs. Our rolling stock is road ready to meet any shutdown or emergency 
								request. Included in our field equipment is an assortment of forklifts, air compressors,                                                                      welders, carry deck crane and job shacks. We are constantly adding equipment to keep in 
                                                                step with the competition, and to help us complete your projects on time and within budget.
