  <h1>A short note on Dhrupad</h1>
  <p>Dhrupad is the oldest surviving form of Indian Classical music and traces its origin to the chanting of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic_chant" target="_blank">vedic hymns and mantras</a>.
 Though a highly developed classical art with a complex and elaborate 
grammar and aesthetics, it is also primarily a form of worship, in which
 offerings are made to the divine through sound or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C4%81da_yoga" target="_blank">nada</a>. Dhrupad can be seen at different levels as a meditation, a mantric recitation, a worship, a yoga or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantra" target="_blank">tantra</a> based on the knowledge of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadi_%28yoga%29">nadis</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakra">cakras</a> and also purely as a performing art portraying a universe of human emotions.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Dhrupad is a vocal tradition based on the practice of nada yoga, 
and is also performed on instruments like the Rudra Veena , the 
Sursringar. or the Rabab For the past five centuries Dhrupad has thrived 
primarily under the patronage of Mughal and Rajput kings. The 
descendants of Zakiruddin Khan and Allabande Khan adopted the name of 
the genre, the Dagar Bani of Dhrupad,as their family name and 
acquired renown as the Dagar brothers.</p>

  <p>They kept this art alive in the difficult period after 1947 when it lost the patronage of the royal courts. <a href="http://www.dhrupad.info/zakiruddin.htm">Zakiruddin</a> and <a href="http://www.dhrupad.info/allabande.htm">Allabande Khan</a>
 were brothers and disciples of their grand-uncle Baba Behram Khan, and 
served respectively in the royal courts of Udaipur and Alwar.</p>

  <p>They were the foremost Dhrupad singers of their times (late 
nineteenth and early twentieth century) and were greatly respected for 
their singing and erudition. Their performances are still remembered 
with awe and reverence. Please see more details about Zakiruddin and 
Allabande and their descendants,today, the Dagar Brothers <a href="http://www.dhrupad.info/dagar_brothers.htm">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="gutter"></div>
  <div class="text-column col-2">

  <p>Although Dhrupad and its preceding forms originated in the chanting
 of vedic hymns and mantras, it gradually evolved into an independent 
art form with its own complex conceptual basis and grammar. Dhrupad was 
originally sung in temples and later thrived under the patronage of 
Mughal and Rajput kings. Fundamental to Dhrupad singing is the practice 
of Nada Yoga, in which, through various yogic practices, the singer 
develops the inner resonance of the body, and can make the sound 
resonate and flow freely through the entire region from navel to head. 
This enables the singer to produce a vast palette of subtle tone colours
 and microtonal shades. The processes of Udatta, Anudatta and Svarita 
play the same fundamental role in Dhrupad singing as in Vedic 
recitation. These processes are fundamentally linked to the ancient grama, murcchana system of tonal relations,and the Dagar tradition is probably the last that uses this ancient system based on murcchanas and not the modern thata or mela system that evolved in the last few centuries. </p>

  <p>A Dhrupad performance starts with the alap which is a slow and 
elaborate development of a Raga (mode) using free flowing melodic 
patterns. The elaboration of Dhrupad alap is done using the syllables of
 a mantric phrase 'om antaran twam, taran taaran twam, ananta hari 
narayan om'. The phrases of Dhrupad alap are very slow and contemplative
 in the beginning, but the tempo increases in stages, and in the faster 
passages playful and vigorous ornaments predominate. The audio and video
 samples on this site give examples of different facets of Dhrupad. 
Dhrupad alāp is followed by the singing of a composition with rhythmic 
improvisation, to the accompaniment of a barrel drum called the pakhawaj
 (ancestor of the tabla).</p>

  <p>The Talas or cycles of beats commonly used are Cautal (12 beats), 
Dhamar (14 beats), Jhaptal (10beats), Sultal (10beats),Tivra (7 beats). 
In the videos on this page can be heard examples of Choutal and Dhamar. 
Dhrupad portrays a vast range of human emotions: serenity, compassion, 
sensuality, pathos, strangeness, anger and heroism and subtle shades of 
them all. In Dhrupad of the Dagar tradition the notes are not treated as
 fixed points, but as fluid entities with infinite microtonal shades.The
 music is deeply spiritual and meditative. The Dagar style of Dhrupad is
 defined by 52 musical concepts or Arkans (12 basic alankars and 40 more
 which amplify and refine them). These include concepts like Udatta, 
Anudatta, Svarita, Sapta Gupta, Sapta Prakata, Sakari etc. which have 
all but disappeared from Indian classical music and even from Dhrupad . 
In the various audio/video files on this site can be heard all these 
concepts as they are used in practice in Dhrupad performance.</p>
