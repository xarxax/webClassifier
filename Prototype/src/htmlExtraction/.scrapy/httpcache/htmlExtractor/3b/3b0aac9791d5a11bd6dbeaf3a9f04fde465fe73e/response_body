A friend of mine sent this poem to me, and I found it to be extremely touching.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

<P>The broken pillar of the wing jags from the clotted shoulder,<BR>
The wing trails like a banner in defeat, <BR>

<P>No more to use the sky forever but live with famine<BR>
And pain a few days:  cat nor coyote<BR>
Will shorten the week of waiting for death, there is game without talons.<BR>

<P>He stands under the oak-bush and waits <BR>
The lame feet of salvation; at night he remembers freedom<BR>
And flies in a dream, the dawns ruin it. <BR>

<P>He is strong and pain is worse to the strong, incapacity is worse.<BR>
The curs of the day come and torment him<BR>
At distance, no one but death the redeemer will humble that head, <BR>

<P>The intrepid readiness, the terrible eyes. <BR>
The wild God of the world is sometimes merciful to those<BR>
That ask mercy, not often to the arrogant. <BR>

<P>You do not know him, you communal people, or you have forgotten him; <BR>
Intemperate and savage, the hawk remembers him;<BR>
Beautiful and wild, the hawks, and men that are dying, remember him.<BR>

<P>I'd sooner, except the penalties, kill a man than a hawk; <BR>
but the great redtail<BR>
Had nothing left but unable misery<BR>
From the bone too shattered for mending, the wing that trailed under his talons when he moved. <BR>

<P>We had fed him six weeks, I gave him freedom,<BR>
He wandered over the foreland hill and returned in the evening, asking for death,<BR>
Not like a beggar, still eyed with the old<BR>
Implacable arrogance. <BR>

<P>I gave him the lead gift in the twilight.<BR>
What fell was relaxed, Owl-downy, soft feminine feathers;  but what<BR>
Soared: the fierce rush: the night-herons by the flooded river cried fear at its rising<BR>
Before it was quite unsheathed from reality. <BR>
