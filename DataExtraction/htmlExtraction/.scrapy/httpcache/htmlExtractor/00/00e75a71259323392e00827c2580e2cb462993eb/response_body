<H1><IMG SRC="marker2.gif"> <I><A NAME="3"> <font color="#004080">How They Brought The Good News From Ghent To Aix</font></A></I></H1>
<UL><DL><P>
<DT><font size="+1">I</font> SPRANG to the stirrup, and Joris, and he:
<DT>I galloped, Dirck galloped, we galloped all three;
<DT>"Good speed!" cried the watch as the gate-bolts undrew;
<DT>"Speed" echoed the wall to us galloping through.
<DT>Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest,
<DT>And into the midnight we galloped abreast.
<P>
<DT>Not a word to each other: we kept the great pace--
<DT>Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place;
<DT>I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight,
<DT>Then shortened each stirrup and set the pique right,
<DT>Rebuckled the check-strap, chained slacker the bit,
<DT>Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.
<P>
<DT>'Twas moonset at starting; but while we drew near
<DT>Lokeren, the cocks crew and twilight dawned clear;
<DT>At Boom a great yellow star came out to see;
<DT>At Dueffeld 'twas morning as plain as could be;
<DT>And from Mecheln church-steeple we heard the half-chime--
<DT>So Joris broke silence with "Yet there is time!"
<P>
<DT>At Aerschot up leaped of a sudden the sun,
<DT>And against him the cattle stood black every one,
<DT>To stare through the mist at us galloping past;
<DT>And I saw my stout galloper Roland at last,
<DT>With resolute shoulders, each butting away
<DT>The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray;
<P>
<DT>And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back
<DT>For my voice, and the other pricked out on his track;
<DT>And one eye's black intelligence,--ever that glance
<DT>O'er its white edge at me, its own master, askance;
<DT>And the thick heavy spume-flakes, which aye and anon
<DT>His fierce lips shook upward in galloping on.
<P>
<DT>By Hasselt Dirck groaned; and cried Joris, "Stay spur!
<DT>Your Roos galloped bravely, the fault's not in her;
<DT>We'll remember at Aix"--for one heard the quick wheeze
<DT>Of her chest, saw the stretched neck, and the staggering knees
<DT>And sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank,
<DT>As down on her haunches she shuddered and sank.
<P>
<DT>So we were left galloping, Joris and I,
<DT>Past Looz and past Tongres, no cloud in the sky;
<DT>The broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh;
<DT>'Neath our feet broke the brittle, bright stubble like chaff;
<DT>Till over by Dalhem a dome-spire sprang white,
<DT>And "Gallop" gasped Joris, "for Aix is in sight!"
<P>
<DT>"How they'll greet us!"--and all in a moment his roan
<DT>Rolled neck and croup over, lay dead as a stone;
<DT>And there was my Roland to bear the whole weight
<DT>Of the news which alone could save Aix from her fate,
<DT>With her nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim,
<DT>And with circles of red for his eye-sockets' rim.
<P>
<DT>Then I cast loose my buff-coat, each holster let fall,
<DT>Shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all,
<DT>Stoop up in the stirrups, leaned, patted his ear,
<DT>Called my Roland his pet-name, my horse without peer--
<DT>Clapped my hands, laughed and sung, any noise, bad or good,
<DT>Till at length into Aix Roland galloped and stood.
<P>
<DT>And all I remember is friends flocking round,
<DT>As I sate with his head 'twixt my knees on the ground;
<DT>And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine,
<DT>As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine,
<DT>Which (the burgesses voted by common consent)
<DT>Was no more than his due who brought good news from Ghent.

<H1><IMG SRC="marker2.gif"><I><A NAME="4"> <font size="+1">A Grammarian's Funeral<br>
Shortly After the Revival of Learning in Europe</font></A></I></H1>
<UL><DL><P>
<DT><font size="+1">L</font>ET us begin and carry up this corpse,
<dd>Singing together.
<DT>Leave we the common crofts, the vulgar thorpes
<dd>Each in its tether
<DT>Sleeping safe on the bosom of the plain,
<dd>Cared for till cock-crow:
<DT>Look out if yonder be not day again
<dd>Rimming the rock-row!
<DT>That's the appropriate country; there, man's thought,
<dd>Rarer, intenser,
<DT>Self-gathered for an outbreak, as it ought,
<dd>Chafes in the censer.
<DT>Leave we the unlettered plain its herd and crop;
<dd>Seek we sepulture
<DT>On a tall mountain, citied to the top,
<dd>Crowded with culture!
<DT>All the peaks soar, but one the rest excels;
<dd>Clouds overcome it;
<DT>No! yonder sparkle is the citadel's
<dd>Circling its summit.
<DT>Thither our path lies; wind we up the heights:
<dd>Wait ye the warning?
<DT>Our low life was the level's and the night's;
<dd>He's for the morning.
<DT>Step to a tune, square chests, erect each head,
<dd>'Ware the beholders!
<DT>This is our master, famous, calm, and dead,
<dd>Borne on our shoulders.
<P>
<DT>Sleep, crop and herd! sleep, darkling thorpe and croft.
<dd>Safe from the weather!
<DT>He, whom we convoy to his grave aloft,
<dd>Singing together,
<DT>He was a man born with thy face and throat,
<dd>Lyric Apollo!
<DT>Long he lived nameless: how should spring take note
<dd>Winter would follow?
<DT>Till lo, the little touch, and youth was gone!
<dd>Cramped and diminished,
<DT>Moaned he, "New measures, other feet anon!
<dd>My dance is finished"?
<DT>No, that's the world's way: (keep the mountain-side,
<dd>Make for the city!)
<DT>He knew the signal, and stepped on with pride
<dd>Over men's pity;
<DT>Left play for work, and grappled with the world
<dd>Bent on escaping:
<DT>"What's in the scroll," quoth he, "thou keepest furled?
<dd>Show me their shaping,
<DT>Theirs who most studied man, the bard and sage-
<dd>Give!"-So, he gowned him,
<DT>Straight got by heart that book to its last page:
<dd>Learned, we found him.
<DT>Yea, but we found him bald too, eyes like lead,
<dd>Accents uncertain:
<DT>"Time to taste life," another would have said,
<dd>"Up with the curtain!"
<DT>This man said rather, "Actual life comes next?
<dd>Patience a moment!
<DT>Grant I have mastered learning's crabbed text,
<dd>Still there's the comment.
<DT>Let me know all! Prate not of most or least,
<dd>Painful or easy!
<DT>Even to the crumbs I'd fain eat up the feast
<dd>Aye, nor feel queasy."
<DT>Oh, such a life as he resolved to live,
<dd>When he had learned it,
<DT>When he had gathered all books had to give!
<dd>Sooner, he spurned it.
<DT>Image the whole, then execute the parts-
<dd>Fancy the fabric
<DT>Quite, ere you build, ere steel strike fire from quartz,
<dd>Ere mortar dab brick!
<P>
<DT>(Here's the town gate reached: there's the market place
<dd>Gaping before us. )
<DT>Yea, this in him was the peculiar grace
<dd>(Hearten our chorus!)
<DT>That before living he'd learn how to live-
<dd>No end to learning:
<DT>Earn the means first-God surely will contrive
<dd>Use for our earning.
<DT>Others mistrust and say, "But time escapes:
<dd>Live now or never!"
<DT>He said, "What's time? Leave Now for dogs and apes!
<dd>Man has Forever."
<DT>Back to his book then: deeper drooped his head:
<dd>Calculus racked him:
<DT>Leaden before, his eyes grew dross of lead:
<dd>Tussis attacked him.
<DT>"Now, master, take a little rest!"-not he!
<dd>(Caution redoubled,
<DT>Step two abreast, the way winds narrowly!)
<dd>Not a whit troubled
<DT>Back to his studies, fresher than at first,
<dd>Fierce as a dragon
<DT>He (soul-hydroptic with a sacred thirst)
<dd>Sucked at the flagon.
<DT>Oh, if we draw a circle premature,
<dd>Heedless of far gain,
<DT>Greedy for quick returns of profit, sure
<dd>Bad is our bargain!
<DT>Was it not great? did not he throw on God
<dd>(He loves the burthen)
<DT>God's task to make the heavenly period
<dd>Perfect the earthen?
<DT>Did not he magnify the mind, show clear
<dd>Just what it all meant?
<DT>He would not discount life, as fools do here,
<dd>Paid by installment.
<DT>He ventured neck or nothing-heaven's success
<dd>Found, or earth's failure:
<DT>"Wilt thou trust death or not?" He answered "Yes:
<dd>Hence with life's pale lure!"
<DT>That low man seeks a little thing to do,
<dd>Sees it and does it:
<DT>This high man, with a great thing to pursue,
<dd>Dies ere he knows it.
<DT>That low man goes on adding one to one,
<dd>His hundred's soon hit:
<DT>This high man, aiming at a million,
<dd>Misses an unit.
<DT>That, has the world here-should he need the next,
<dd>Let the world mind him!
<DT>This, throws himself on God, and unperplexed
<dd>Seeking shall find him.
<DT>So, with the throttling hands of death at strife,
<dd>Ground he at grammar;
<DT>Still, through the rattle, parts of speech were rife:
<dd>While he could stammer
<DT>He settled Hoti's business-let it be!-
<dd>Properly based Oun-
<DT>Gave us the doctrine of the enclitic De,
<dd>Dead from the waist down.
<DT>Well, here's the platform, here's the proper place:
<dd>Hail to your purlieus,
<DT>All ye highfliers of the feathered race,
<dd>Swallows and curlews!
<DT>Here's the top peak; the multitude below
<dd>Live, for they can, there:
<DT>This man decided not to Live but Know-
<dd>Bury this man there?
<DT>Here-here's his place, where meteors shoot, clouds form,
<dd>Lightnings are loosened,
<DT>Stars come and go! Let joy break with the storm,
<dd>Peace let the dew send!
<DT>Lofty designs must close in like effects:
<dd>Loftily lying,
<DT>Leave him-still loftier than the world suspects,
<dd>Living and dying.

<H1><IMG SRC="marker2.gif"><I><A NAME="5"> <font color="#004080">My Last Duchess</font></A></I></H1>
<UL><DL><P>
<DT><font size="+1">T</font>HAT'S my last Duchess painted on the wall,
<DT>Looking as if she were alive.  I call
<DT>That piece a wonder, now: Fra Pandolf's hands
<DT>Worked busily a day, and there she stands.
<DT>Will 't please you to sit and look at her? I said
<DT>``Fra Pandolf'' by design, for never read
<DT>Strangers like you that pictured countenance,
<DT>The depth and passion of its earnest glance,
<DT>But to my self they turned (since none puts by
<DT>The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)
<DT>And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,
<DT>How such a glance came there; so, not the first
<DT>Are you to turn and ask thus.  Sir, 't was not
<DT>Her husband's presence only, called that spot
<DT>Of joy into the Duchess' cheek: perhaps
<DT>Fra Pandolf chanced to say, ``Her mantle laps
<DT>Over my lady's wrist too much,'' or ``Paint
<DT>Must never hope to reproduce the faint
<DT>Half-flush that dies along her throat:'' such stuff
<DT>Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough
<DT>For calling up that spot of joy.  She had
<DT>A heart--how shall I say?--too soon made glad,
<DT>Too easily impressed: she liked whate'er
<DT>She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.
<DT>Sir, 't was all one! My favor at her breast,
<DT>The bough of cherries some officious fool
<DT>Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule
<DT>She rode with round the terrace--all and each
<DT>Would draw from her alike the approving speech,
<DT>Or blush, at least.  She thanked men,--good! but thanked
<DT>Somehow,--I know not how--as if she ranked
<DT>My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name
<DT>With anybody's gift.  Who'd stoop to blame
<DT>This sort of trifling?  Even had you skill
<DT>In speech--(which I have not)--to make your will
<DT>Quite clear to such an one, and say, ``Just this
<DT>Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,
<DT>Or there exceed the mark''--and if she let
<DT>Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set
<DT>Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,
<DT>--E'en then would be some stooping; and I choose
<DT>Never to stoop.  Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt,
<DT>Whene'er I passed her; but who passed without
<DT>Much the same smile?  This grew; I gave commands;
<DT>Then all smiles stopped together.  There she stands
<DT>As if alive.  Will 't please you rise?  We'll meet
<DT>The company below, then.  I repeat,
<DT>The Count your master's known munificence
<DT>Is ample warrant that no just pretence
<DT>Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;
<DT>Though his fair daughter's self, as I avowed
<DT>At starting, is my object.  Nay, we'll go
<DT>Together down, sir.  Notice Neptune, though,
<DT>Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,
<DT>Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!

<DT><font size="+1">O</font>H, to be in England
<DT>Now that April's there,

<DT>Sees, some morning, unaware,
<DT>That the lowest boughs and the brush-wood sheaf

<DT>And after April, when May follows,

<DT>Hark, where my blossomed pear-tree in the hedge
<DT>Leans to the field and scatters on the clover
<DT>Blossoms and dewdrops--at the bent spray's edge--

<UL><DL><P>
<DT><font size="+1">G</font>ROW old along with me!
<DT>The best is yet to be,
<DT>The last of life, for which the first was made:
<DT>Our times are in his hand
<DT>Who saith, ``A whole I planned,
<DT>Youth shows but half; trust God: see all, nor be afraid!''
<P>
<DT>Not that, amassing flowers,
<DT>Youth sighed, ``Which rose make ours,
<DT>Which lily leave and then as best recall?''
<DT>Not that, admiring stars,
<DT>It yearned, ``Nor Jove, nor Mars;
<DT>Mine be some figured flame which blends, transcends them all!''
<P>
<DT>Not for such hopes and fears
<DT>Annulling youth's brief years,
<DT>Do I remonstrate: folly wide the mark!
<DT>Rather I prize the doubt
<DT>Low kinds exist without,
<DT>Finished and finite clods, untroubled by a spark.
<P>
<DT>Poor vaunt of life indeed,
<DT>Were man but formed to feed
<DT>On joy, to solely seek and find and feast;
<DT>Such feasting ended, then
<DT>As sure an end to men;
<DT>Irks care the crop full bird? Frets doubt the maw-crammed beast?
<P>
<DT>Rejoice we are allied
<DT>To that which doth provide
<DT>And not partake, effect and not receive!
<DT>A spark disturbs our clod;
<DT>Nearer we hold of God
<DT>Who gives, <i>then</i> of his tribes that take, I must believe.
<P>
<DT>Then, welcome each rebuff
<DT>That turns earth's smoothness rough,
<DT>Each sting that bids nor sit nor stand but go!
<DT>Be our joys three-parts pain!
<DT>Strive,and hold cheap the strain;
<DT>Learn, nor account the pang; dare, never grudge the throe!
<P>
<DT>For thence,--a paradox
<DT>Which comforts while it mocks,--
<DT>Shall life succeed in that it seems to fail:
<DT>What I aspired to be,
<DT>And was not, comforts me:
<DT>A brute I might have been, but would not sink i'the scale.
<P>
<DT>What is he but a brute
<DT>Whose flesh has soul to suit,
<DT>Whose spirit works lest arms and legs want play?
<DT>To man, propose this test--
<DT>Thy body at its best,
<DT>How far can that project thy soul on its lone way?
<P>
<DT>Yet gifts should prove their use:
<DT>I own the Past profuse
<DT>Of power each side, a perfection every turn:
<DT>Eyes, ears took in their dole,
<DT>Brain treasured up the whole;
<DT>Should not the heart beat once ``How good to live and learn''?
<P>
<DT>Not once beat ``Praise be thine!
<DT>I see the whole design,
<DT>I, who saw power, see now Love perfect too:
<DT>Perfect I call thy plan:
<DT>Thanks that I was a man!
<DT>Maker, remake, complete,--I trust what thou shalt do!''
<P>
<DT>For pleasant is this flesh;
<DT>Our soul, in its rose-mesh
<DT>Pulled over to the earth, still yearns for rest:
<DT>Would we some prize might hold
<DT>To match those manifold
<DT>Possessions of the brute,--gain most, as we did best!
<P>
<DT>Let us not always say,
<DT>``Spite of this flesh to-day
<DT>I strove, made head, gained ground upon the whole!''
<DT>As the bird wings and sings,
<DT>Let us cry, ``All good things
<DT>Are ours, nor soul helps flesh more, now, than flesh helps soul!''
<P>
<DT>Therefore I summon age
<DT>To grant youth's heritage,
<DT>Life's struggle having so far reached its term:
<DT>Thence shall I pass, approved
<DT>A man, for aye removed
<DT>From the developed brute; a God though in the germ.
<P>
<DT>And I shall thereupon
<DT>Take rest, ere I be gone
<DT>Once more on my adventure brave and new:
<DT>Fearless and unperplexed,
<DT>When I wage battle next,
<DT>What weapons to select, what armor to indue.
<P>
<DT>Youth ended, I shall try
<DT>My gain or loss thereby;
<DT>Leave the fire ashes, what survives is gold:
<DT>And I shall weigh the same,
<DT>Give life its praise or blame:
<DT>Young, all lay in dispute; I shall know, being old.
<P>
<DT>For note, when evening shuts,
<DT>A certain moment cuts
<DT>The deed off, calls the glory from the gray:
<DT>A whisper from the west
<DT>Shoots--``Add this to the rest,
<DT>Take it and try its worth: here dies another day.''
<P>
<DT>So, still within this life,
<DT>Though lifted o'er its strife,
<DT>Let me discern, compare, pronounce at last,
<DT>``This rage was right i' the main,
<DT>That acquiescence vain:
<DT>The Future I may face now I have proved the Past.''
<P>
<DT>For more is not reserved
<DT>To man, with soul just nerved
<DT>To act to-morrow what he learns to-day:
<DT>Here, work enough to watch
<DT>The Master work, and catch
<DT>Hints of the proper craft, tricks of the tool's true play.
<P>
<DT>As it was better, youth
<DT>Should strive, through acts uncouth,
<DT>Toward making than repose on aught found made:
<DT>So, better, age, exempt
<DT>From strife, should know, than tempt
<DT>Further.  Thou waitedst age: wait death nor be afraid!
<P>
<DT>Enough now, if the Right
<DT>And Good and Infinite
<DT>Be named here, as thou callest thy hand thine own,
<DT>With knowledge absolute,
<DT>Subject to no dispute
<DT>From fools that crowded youth, nor let thee feel alone.
<P>
<DT>Be there, for once and all,
<DT>Severed great minds from small,
<DT>Announced to each his station in the Past!
<DT>Was I, the world arraigned,
<DT>Were they, my soul disdained,
<DT>Right?  Let age speak the truth and give us peace at last!
<P>
<DT>Now, who shall arbitrate?
<DT>Ten men love what I hate,
<DT>Shun what I follow, slight what I receive;
<DT>Ten, who in ears and eyes
<DT>Match me: we all surmise,
<DT>They this thing, I that: whom shall my soul believe?
<P>
<DT>Not on the vulgar mass
<DT>Called ``work'' must sentence pass,
<DT>Things done, that took the eye and had the price;
<DT>O'er which, from level stand,
<DT>The low world laid its hand,
<DT>Found straightway to its mind, could value in a trice:
<P>
<DT>But all, the world's coarse thumb
<DT>And finger failed to plumb,
<DT>So passed in making up the main account;
<DT>All instincts immature,
<DT>All purposes unsure,
<DT>That weighed not as his work, yet swelled the man's amount:
<P>
<DT>Thoughts hardly to be packed
<DT>Into a narrow act,
<DT>Fancies that broke through language and escaped;
<DT>All I could never be,
<DT>All, men ignored in me,
<DT>This, I was worth to God, whose wheel the pitcher shaped.
<P>
<DT>Ay, note that Potter's wheel,
<DT>That metaphor! and feel
<DT>Why time spins fast, why passive lies our clay,--
<DT>Thou, to whom fools propound,
<DT>When the wine makes its round,
<DT>``Since life fleets, all is change; the Past gone, seize to-day.''
<P>
<DT>Fool! All that is, at all,
<DT>Lasts ever, past recall;
<DT>Earth changes, but thy soul and God stand sure:
<DT>What entered into thee,
<DT><i>That</i> was, is, and shall be:
<DT>Time's wheel runs back or stops: Potter and clay endure.
<P>
<DT>He fixed thee 'mid this dance
<DT>Of plastic circumstance,
<DT>This Present, thou, forsooth, would fain arrest:
<DT>Machinery just meant
<DT>To give thy soul its bent,
<DT>Try thee and turn thee forth, sufficiently impressed.
<P>
<DT>What though the earlier grooves,
<DT>Which ran the laughing loves
<DT>Around thy base, no longer pause and press?
<DT>What though, about thy rim,
<DT>Skull-things in order grim
<DT>Grow out, in graver mood, obey the sterner stress?
<P>
<DT>Look not thou down but up!
<DT>To uses of a cup,
<DT>The festal board, lamp's flash and trumpet's peal,
<DT>The new wine's foaming flow,
<DT>The Master's lips aglow!
<DT>Thou, heaven's consummate cup, what needst thou with earth's wheel?
<P>
<DT>But I need, now as then,
<DT>Thee, God, who mouldest men;
<DT>And since, not even while the whirl was worst,
<DT>Did I--to the wheel of life
<DT>With shapes and colors rife,
<DT>Bound dizzily--mistake my end, to slake thy thirst:
<P>
<DT>So, take, and use thy work:
<DT>Amend what flaws may lurk,
<DT>What strain o' the stuff, what warpings past the aim!
<DT>My times be in thy hand!
<DT>Perfect the cup as planned!
<DT>Let age approve of youth, and death complete the same!
