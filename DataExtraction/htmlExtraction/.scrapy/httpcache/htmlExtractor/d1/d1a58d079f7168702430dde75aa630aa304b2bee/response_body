                              C.  P.  Cavafy

A young poet visited me," he wrote.   "He was very poor, lived by
his literary work, and it seemed to me that he was grieved to see the
good house I was living in, my servant who brought him a nicely served
tea, my clothes made by a good tailor.   He said:  what a horrible
thing it is to have to struggle for a livelihood, to hunt subscribers
your periodical, and purchasers for your book.
<p>
I didn't want to leave him in his delusion, so I said a few words,
more or less as follows.   His position is difficult and disagreeable--
but how much my little luxuries cost me.   In order to obtain them I
departed from my natural course and became a government servant (how
absurd!) and I spend and lose all those precious hours a day-- to
which must be added the hours of weariness and sluggishness that
follow--  what a loss, and what a betrayal!   While this poor fellow
doesn't waste a single hour;   he's always faithful to his duty as a
child of Art.
<p>
How often during my work a fine idea comes to me,  a rare image,
and sudden ready-formed lines, and I'm obliged to leave them,  because
work can't be put off.   Then when I go home and recover a bit,  I try
to remember them, but they're gone.   And it's quite right.   It's as if
Art said to me:   'I'm not a servant, for you to turn me out when I
come, and to come when you want.   I'm the greatest lady in the world.
And if you deny me-- miserable traitor-- for your wretched "nice
house," and your wretched good clothes and your wretched social
position, be content with that (but how can you?) and for the
moments when I come and it happens that you're ready to receive me,
come outside your door to wait for me, as you ought to every day.'
<p>June 1905."
