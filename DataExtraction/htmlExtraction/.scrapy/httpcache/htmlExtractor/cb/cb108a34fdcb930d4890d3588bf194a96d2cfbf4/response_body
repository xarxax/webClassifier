          <strong>Welcome to Midwest Thermal-Vac.</strong> Founded in 1999 by 
          Fred Otto, MTV has become a leader in vacuum carburizing and heat treating 
          for the Aerospace, Motor sports, and Commercial Industries with multiple 
          quenching to handle just about any commercial material. </span> </div>

          <strong>Vacuum Carburizing.</strong> By achiving <a href="pdfs/2018 AS9100 CERT.pdf" class="style5" title="2018 AS9100 Certificate">ISO 
          9001 and AS9100</a> registration Midwest Thermal-Vac has taken considerable 
          measures to not only maintain it&#8217;s Industry leading status, but 
          exceed it. While this may be good enough for some heat treating facilities, 
          Midwest Thermal-Vac has successfully achieved Nadcap accreditation to 
          show that our pyrometry procedures are controlled, consistent and repeatable 
          enough to meet the highest standards and tolerances within the aerospace 
          community.<br>
      
            <br>
      
      MTV uses the patented <a href="pages/infracarb.html" class="style5">Infracarb</a> process from <a href="http://www.ecm-usa.com" title="ECM-USA" class="style5">ECM</a>, which allows low pressure Vacuum Carburizing, Carbonitriding and other case hardening
      applications to be done under vacuum. By taking advantage of the latest technology and processes, the potential for large savings is available through less distortion. This means less stock needs to be taken off during final grinding and consistent tolerances mean more usable pieces per lot and savings for our clients. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Traditional Vacuum Heat Treating</strong><br>
      
      MTV can also satisfy your needs for conventional solution, isothermal, spherodized or full annealing, homogenizing, normalizing, austenitizing and tempering tool steel. All stainless steel processes are also conducted under vacuum. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Our Goal</strong> at 
      Midwest Thermal-Vac is to be the
      &#8220;World Class Leader&#8221;
      in Vacuum processes specializing in
      Vacuum Carburizing and Heat treating <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Quality Assurance</strong><br>
      Staffed by the companies&#8217; two metallurgists and several engineering professionals, MTV&#8217;s facility features a complete metallurgical laboratory.<br>

             <span class="style2"><strong>Low-pressure carburizing</strong> Since being developed in the
               late 1960's, much progress and many improvements have been made. Modern technologies and 
			   recent advancements in low-pressure carburizing (LPC) within the last fifteen years have made many 
			   companies throughout the industry realize the many proven benefits of LPC, 
			   primarily it's capability of precise process control, can no longer be ignored.
               Tight control enables absolute repeatability, optimized
               part microstructure, enhanced
               mechanical properties, and reduced
               manufacturing costs.<BR>
			 <BR>
			   While some heat treat companies have just begun realizing the benefits and have begun offering 
			   LPC services, Midwest Thermal-Vac has been vacuum carburizing since 1999 and continues to be an industry leader.

             <strong>Vacuum carburizing technology</strong><br>
                 
             Demand for vacuum carburizing systems equipped
             with high-pressure gas quenching,
             oil quenching, or both has quadrupled
             since 2000, as the technology
             has replaced atmosphere carburizing
             and traditional oil quenching in
             many cases. New advances in <a href="http://www.industrialheating.com/Articles/Feature_Article/b91c79c356cb7010VgnVCM100000f932a8c0____" title="Vacuum furnace technology" class="style5">vacuum furnace technology</a> help integrate heat treating equipment on the shop floor and into the production flow of the manufacturing process.

            Temperature uniformity is critical for vacuum carburizing, especially 
            in the low-temperature ranges, and a maximum spread of ?0°F (?.5°C) 
            is required to maintain tight case depth control throughout the load. 
            This is equally important for vacuum carbonitriding cycles, which 
            are run as low as 1425°F (775°C). Highly loaded gears and shafts, 
            such as those in off-road vehicles under extreme race conditions, 
            require fracture toughness values two or three times those of conventional 
            vehicles. Tightly controlled low-pressure vacuum carburizing processes 
            deliver these high-performance values. <BR>

             <strong>Hardness:</strong> The new materials require
               better control of hardness and
               carbon distribution (case/core hardness,
               surface/near surface), optimized
               microstructures, and control
               of such factors as retained austenite,
               carbide size (type and distribution),
               and non-martensitic phases. Property
               control is also critical, especially
               for characteristics such as residual
               stress patterns and surface finish, and
               mechanical properties such as toughness,
               impact strength, and wear
               resistance.
               
               Improved performance demands
               in aircraft and rotorcraft not only are
               pushing the development of advanced
               materials, but also are driving
               prime contractors and their suppliers
               to low pressure vacuum carburizing.
