      <td>We expect poets to give a first-hand account of what poetry is. But some
poets, when they write criticism, produce a kind of prose that is itself on the
verge of being poetry. Valéry, Stevens and Marianne Moore belong to this
&quot;visionary company.&quot; And so does Barbara Guest, whose writings on
poetry, collected here, are among the most inspiring works of their kind. It is
a deep pleasure to know that such writing can still exist.

    <tr>
      <td>In this companion to her important poetry, Barbara Guest may be said
        to advance a poetics amazed in its dreaminess and lyrical in its
        critical register. No wonder the Symbolist poetics from which she takes
        her core meaning is as integral to her poetry as it is: it is the way
        she thinks! Her aphoristic plasticity is affirmative, affirmative in
        performing imaginative acts on our behalf.

    <tr>
      <td>Guest has earned her formidable reputation through dedication to
        modern lyric's difficult double-project of making song think and making
        thought sing, of stretching the very medium of conceptual thought —
        language — all the way toward music and affect, but without
        relinquishing any of the rigor of conceptual intellection. The essays,
        talks and addresses, and prose and verse meditations now gathered in
        Forces of Imagination offer welcome points of entry into Guest's
        challenging aesthetic.

      <td>Writing about thinkers, poets and writers as diverse as Baudelaire,
        Mallarmé, Plato, Walter Benjamin, Kant, Pasternak, Machado de Assis,
        H.D., Horace, Wallace Stevens and Pound; about radical and conservative
        poetics, modernism, postmodernism, the relationship between art and
        poetry; about the importance of imagination and surprise in poetry,
        Barbara Guest situates herself in a multi-faceted literary landscape
        spanning centuries and continents, at the same time providing brilliant
        insights into the roots and workings of contemporary poetry. This is an
        evocative collection of essays and poems on writing that might be quite
        provocative to a certain audience steeped in the poetics of academia.
        Fascinating reading for anyone interested in the possibilities of modern
        writing.
