		By now the story is all too familiar: a writer 
				comes along, dissatisfied with the status quo of writing, its 
				conventions and models, and yet yearns to communicate his vision 
				of a reality ignored by all those before him. He shocks the 
				literary establishment with his <i>aliterary</i> style and his 
				blunt language, his eagerness to &quot;make it new,&quot; as Ezra Pound 
				would say. He brings the American language alive on the page, 
				the way it is spoken by the average American, and thereby 
				delights readers who have long been disenchanted by literature's 
				antiseptic content and alienating austerity.<p>Of course, this 
				new author's work at first finds outlet only through 
				self-publication or the underground magazines and presses. But 
				word spreads quickly among readers excited by the vitality and 
				newness of approach and language. Despite this undeniable 
				popularity, however, and his influence on countless younger 
				American writers, established American critics, the New York 
				publishers, the professors of American literature all refuse to 
				recognize this new voice. At first, he was simply too shockingly 
				new to be taken seriously. Only after the author's death do the 
				articles, the dissertations, and the books begin to examine this 
				phenomenon. Only then does the author's work begin to appear in 
				all the major anthologies and to be taught regularly in courses 
				on American literature. The established authors of the time 
				gradually fade away, and the ones that were true mavericks and 
				undeniable influences take their places permanently in the major 
				anthologies of American literature.</p>
				<p>Charles Bukowski's career is a paradigm of the scenario 
				outlined above. He thus joins some illustrious company, like 
				Walt Whitman, William Carlos Williams, and Allen Ginsberg--all 
				now considered major figures in American literature, and all 
				either ignored or denounced early on by the literary 
				establishment. But if an author's popularity and influence <i>
				outside</i> of the New York publishing houses and the 
				departments of English is the yardstick, then Charles Bukowski 
				will also become an unavoidable part of any discussion of 
				post-war American literature.</p>
				<p>Born on 16 August 1920 in Andernach, West Germany, Bukowski 
				was brought to the United States at age 2. His mother, a native 
				German, and his father, an American serviceman, met during the 
				American occupation of Germany at the end of World War I. 
				According to Bukowski, his mother's family was like most after 
				the war, poor and undernourished and resentful of American 
				soldiers that had plenty of meat and took it for granted. One 
				day, according to the story, Bukowski's father knocked on the 
				door of his mother's family's living quarters, a floor above the 
				quarters occupied by the father's division. He offered the 
				family a piece of meat, and the mother, indignant at what she 
				had seen of the Americans' wastefulness, spat on the father's 
				shoes. Thereafter, understanding the severity of the German 
				family's plight and the depth of their resentment, Bukowski's 
				father stole away each evening with a piece of meat garnered 
				from the division's supply and offered it to the German family. 
				Touched by this gesture, Bukowski's mother's feeling softened 
				toward the man, and they eventually married. Bukowski's father 
				was apparently fairly fluent in German, but the couple returned 
				to the United States at the end of the father's term in Germany, 
				seeing in the U.S. the possibility of a brighter future.</p>
				<p>This bright future, though, soon evaporated at the onset of 
				the Great Depression. Bukowski's father, like many other fathers 
				at the time, was more often than not unemployed, and no doubt 
				much of the frustration of that experience was taken out on 
				Charles. For most of the memories that Charles Bukowski has of 
				his father, recounted in many poems and such stories as &quot;The 
				Death of the Father&quot; as well as the novel <i>Ham on Rye</i>, are 
				bad ones. Mention of the father in Bukowski's work usually 
				entails stories of beatings with a strap, verbal abuse, and a 
				blind resentment of other people. &quot;Wherever we went he got into 
				arguments with people&quot; (26), says the narrator of <i>Ham on Rye</i>.</p>
				<p>Bukowski's childhood and adolescence were, then, anything but 
				pleasant. At home, the situation was exacerbated by an extremely 
				bad case of <i>acne vulgaris</i> that produced boils all over 
				Bukowski's face and back, boils so painful that they had to be 
				surgically drilled so that they could drain properly. &quot;Acne 
				Vulgaris,&quot; says one of the doctors who works on the young 
				Bukowski in <i>Ham on Rye</i>, the autobiographical novel that 
				provides the only thorough account of his childhood, &quot;The worst 
				case I've seen in all my years of practice!&quot; (131). This malady 
				was of course impossible to disguise--indeed, Bukowski was 
				permanently pock-marked by the ordeal--and it made emotional 
				escape into adolescent friendships or cliques, where appearance 
				plays so often a vital role, next to impossible.</p>				



				<p>These two conditions of Bukowski's early life--his father's 
				abusive tendencies and Bukowski's disfigurement-- molded his 
				role as a perpetual outsider. As a loner he bore daily witness 
				to the cruelty, shallowness, and lack of sympathy in human 
				interaction. Because only &quot;the poor and the lost and the idiots&quot; 
				(<i>Ham on Rye</i> 155) seemed willing to befriend the young 
				Bukowski, he later became their spokesman throughout his work, 
				their honesty and hard-won dignity contrasted constantly with 
				the phoniness and superficiality of the indifferent masses.				</p>
				<p>But instead of harboring bitterness for a tumultuous and 
				solitary childhood, Bukowski has used the experiences and 
				insights gained from his position on the outside to his 
				advantage. As is the case with many reclusive adolescents, 
				Bukowski early on discovered the solitude and magic of the word. 
				&quot;I would take a little light in my bed,&quot; Bukowski says in a <i>
				High Times</i> interview of 1982, &quot;put it under the covers and 
				read, and it would get suffocating under there and hot, but it 
				made each page I turned all the more glorious, like I was taking 
				dope: Sinclair Lewis, Dos Passos, these are my friends under the 
				covers&quot; (98).</p>
				<p>And through the word he found an outlet through which to 
				express what he had seen of the world. He turned experiences 
				that may have made the average person bitter or destructive into 
				lessons concerning his art. Bukowski says of the repeated 
				floggings that he received at his father's hands, </p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>when they beat you long enough and hard enough you have 
					the tendency to say what you really mean; in other words, 
					they take all the pretenses out of you. If you can get out 
					of it, whatever is still there is usually something genuine. 
					Anyone who gets severe punishment during childhood can get 
					out of it quite strong, quite good, or can end up being a 
					rapist, a killer, end up in a madhouse or lost in all kinds 
					of different directions. So you see, my father was a great 
					literary teacher: He taught me the meaning of pain--pain 
					without reason (<i>High Times</i> 98).</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>And the <i>acne vulgaris</i>, too, by dint of its having made 
				the young Bukowski a social loner, placed Bukowski at a vantage 
				point from which he, with his talent, could make frank 
				observations and condemnations of humanity without fear of 
				losing a job or being excluded from a clique or political 
				faction. Ernest Fontana has aptly noted that &quot;because of his 
				acne (Bukowski) will never be able to look at his society from 
				the point of view of an insider. His acne is not only the 
				literal source of his alienation, but his disfiguring and 
				offensive boils are themselves metaphoric equivalents to 
				Bukowski's own writing, which expresses the offensive, `acned' 
				reality of Los Angeles working and sub- working class life 
				without stylistic ointment of clothing&quot; (6).</p>
				<p>Convinced, then, almost from the outset of the hopelessness 
				of humanity and lasting friendship, he largely rejected the 
				goals after which most strive. Instead, he found solace in 
				alcohol. &quot;Getting drunk was good,&quot; Bukowski says in <i>Ham on 
				Rye</i>. &quot;I decided that I would always like getting drunk. It 
				took away the obvious and maybe if you could get away from the 
				obvious often enough, you wouldn't become obvious yourself&quot; 
				(189). Drinking and remaining &quot;unobvious&quot; thus became Bukowski's 
				vocation, until, that is, he started writing seriously around 
				1960. Then drinking, remaining &quot;unobvious,&quot; and <i>writing</i> 
				were his vocations, and remain so to this day. Necessitated by 
				the fact that none of his vocations paid enough for him to 
				survive, he worked as dishwasher, truckdriver and loader, 
				mailman, guard, gas station attendant, stock boy, warehouseman, 
				shipping clerk, post office clerk, parking lot attendant, Red 
				Cross orderly, and elevator operator, among other things (<i>Contemporary 
				Authors</i> 109).</p>
				

				<p>Bukowski worked at a Los Angeles post office for eleven 
				years, the longest term of employment he ever held. And in 1969, 
				having had some hard-earned success as a writer through the 
				little magazines and small presses, he made the difficult 
				decision of quitting the post office and trying to make it as a 
				writer. He was forty-nine and on the verge of emotional 
				collapse; he was paying child-support and living in a rented 
				house. Steady or sufficient income through writing was far from 
				certain. In an unpublished letter to Carl Weissner, dated 
				&quot;sometime nov. 1969,&quot; Bukowski explains that &quot;I have one of two 
				choices--stay in the postoffice and go crazy...or stay out here 
				and play at writer and starve. I have decided to starve.&quot; Soon 
				thereafter he finished his first novel, <i>Post Office</i>. And 
				through Carl Weissner, a young German editor with whom he had 
				frequently corresponded regarding little magazine publications, 
				he sold the West German rights to <i>Notes of a Dirty Old Man</i>. 
				His income was still poor but sufficient to allow him to write 
				full-time.</p>
				<p>And write he did. To date, he has published over sixty 
				books--poetry, short stories, novels--and he has been translated 
				into all the European languages, including Greek and Serbo-Croat. 
				In some European countries, like France, Brazil Spain, Italy, 
				and West Germany, newspapers and magazines scurry for Bukowski-related 
				stories. In 1984, three of Bukowski's books were on the 
				bestseller list in Brazil at one time. And in West Germany, 
				where his audience has from the outset been the most 
				enthusiastic and prodigious, much more so than in the United 
				States, his books have sold over three million copies.</p>
				
				<p>Indeed, Bukowski's European success, which his American 
				critics conveniently ignore and his fans gloat knowingly over, 
				is a phenomenon yet to be systematically explained. Gerald 
				Locklin has suggested that Bukowski's &quot;flouting of the 
				conventions and proprieties of a `bourgeois' literature&quot; repels 
				readers in America. &quot;Where but in the English- speaking 
				countries,&quot; Locklin continues, &quot;could manners become elevated to 
				such a powerful aesthetic criterion in the first place?&quot; (159) 
				In an unpublished interview, Carl Weissner, Bukowski's West 
				German translator, points out that &quot;mostly the (West German) 
				critics stress the fact that he's hugely enjoyable..., (and they 
				like his attitude) of aloofness and an unwillingness to be 
				accepted into the fold and be a good citizen...But I think 
				Bukowski expresses something which is shared by a lot of people: 
				the unappetizing aspects of life and a willingness to sometimes 
				overdo it, mostly in a funny way.&quot; Bukowski himself in a letter 
				to the author explains his European success this way: &quot;I believe 
				that the (European) public is more open to gamble and new ways 
				of presentation. Here in the U.S. a more staid and safe 
				literature seems preferred. Here people don't want to be shaken 
				or awakened. They prefer to sleep through their lives. To them, 
				what is safe and old seems good.&quot;</p>
				<p>Charles Bukowski is a Western writer not by choice but by 
				circumstance. Chances are, had he been raised in Chicago, New 
				Orleans, Atlanta, or New York rather than in Los Angeles, he 
				would be a writer of those regions and not the West. Unlike many 
				Western writers, Bukowski is not concerned with exploring or 
				exploiting the traditions of the West; he does not, as a writer 
				like Edward Abbey would in <i>Good News</i>, discuss the 
				American West ever with an eye toward its past, its immigrants, 
				Indians, and unfulfilled or ruined promise of plenty. He does 
				not, as Ernest Fontana has noted, &quot;exploit the rich metaphoric 
				possibilities of the diverse topography of Southern California&quot; 
				(4). Los Angeles is, simply, the place that Charles Bukowski has 
				lived for most of his life. As he says in a <i>London Magazine</i> 
				interview of 1974, &quot;You live in a town all your life, and you 
				get to know every street corner. You've got the layout of the 
				whole land. You have a picture of where you are....Since I was 
				raised in L.A., I've always had the geographical and spiritual 
				feeling of being here. I've had time to learn this city. I can't 
				see any other place than L.A&quot; (38-39).</p>
				<p>Thus, while he does not concern himself with the mythological 
				possibilities of the West that an immigrant writer might be 
				likely to exploit, Bukowski does, as the quotation above 
				suggests, feel that Los Angeles possesses a unique &quot;spiritual&quot; 
				identity. And this identity is as inseparable from much of 
				Bukowski's work as are the Spanish bullfights and street cafes 
				from the best of Hemingway. Rather than bullfights and street 
				cafes, Bukowski's mileau is the horsetrack, the backstreet bars, 
				and the rooming houses of Los Angeles.</p>
				<p>And this is only logical, for these parts of Los Angeles have 
				been Bukowski's life-long home, his stomping grounds. He 
				apotheosizes these parts of Los Angeles like no writer before 
				him. He argues, like Hemingway would of his world, for Los 
				Angeles' distinctive culture and for its being the perfect 
				testing ground for a brand of endurance that Bukowski respects, 
				an endurance borne not of having played the games of the masses 
				but of having <i>avoided</i> the games of the masses--two cars, 
				a house in the suburbs, a steady job, a couple of kids--and 
				having survived. Los Angeles, to Bukowski, contains more of 
				these kinds of survivors than most cities, and it is a place 
				where one can escape from others long enough to remain &quot;sane.&quot; 
				In <i>Notes of a Dirty Old Man</i>, Bukowski exclaims, L.A., the 
				greatest city in the universe. Where each man and woman had a 
				special style and a natural cool. Even the fools had a certain 
				grace. L.A. was the end of a dead culture crawled west to get 
				away from itself. L.A. knew it was rotten and laughed at it. Ask 
				Chicago, ask New York City, they still think they are alive. No 
				good. ...While San Francisco chokes upon the glut of artists, 
				L.A. wheels, stands at the corner of Hollywood and Western, 
				munching a taco and enjoying the bluff and the sun...&quot; ( ).</p>
				<p>Charles Bukowski is above all a poet. Although his first 
				publication, at the age of twenty-four, was a short story called 
				&quot;20 Tanks from Kasseldon,&quot; soon afterwards he gave up writing 
				for ten years because he &quot;thought there was no way of crashing 
				through&quot; (<i>London Magazine</i> 44) to publication with the 
				large presses and slick magazines for a person who wanted to 
				describe a less-pleasant side of reality in blunt, 
				matter-of-fact terms. He was right. After a ten year hiatus and 
				a near-fatal bout with alcoholism that took him finally to the 
				L.A. County General Hospital, &quot;blood roaring out of (his) mouth 
				and...ass&quot; (<i>London Magazine</i> 45), because of a stomach 
				ulcer, he began writing poetry and submitting the poems to 
				little magazines. This time his efforts were appreciated. And so 
				began the gradual climb to his current status as the most 
				highly- acclaimed poet in the history of the small press in 
				America.</p>
				<p>Bukowski's style and his approach to poetry have varied 
				surprisingly little over the more than thirty-five years that he 
				has been practicing the art. His first two full- length 
				collections of poems, <i>It Catches My Heart in Its Hands</i> 
				and <i>Crucifix in a Death Hand</i>, parts of which are still 
				available in <i>Burning in Water Drowning in Flame</i>, 
				illustrate that most if not all of the trademark Bukowskian 
				qualities are present: a keen ear for the musical quality of 
				natural, everyday speech; an ability to infuse significance into 
				desperate, dreadful moments of his own life and those of others 
				without becoming bathetic or sentimental; a tremendous facility 
				of listing and juxtaposing details of everyday life with 
				abstraction either to set a scene or to vivify a theme; an 
				artistic distance from his subjects which allows him to find 
				humor and nuggests of wisdom in even the most dismal scenario, 
				his own or others'; and a propensity for the narrative poem, 
				which he will exploit further in later books.</p>
				<p>&quot;the tragedy of the leaves,&quot; the first poem in <i>Burning in 
				Water Drowning in Flame</i>, shows Bukowski at his tightest 
				lyrically. The first line, &quot;I awakened to dryness and the ferns 
				were dead,&quot; sets the reader down abruptly into a world as raped 
				of hope and promise as Eliot's first line in &quot;Gerontion&quot;: &quot;Here 
				I am, an old man in a dry month.&quot; But Bukowski's details remain 
				close to home, not alluding to mythologies but the realities of 
				the downtrodden, a permanent wasteland as much of circumstance 
				as of choice: &quot;and the empty bottles like bled corpses / 
				surrounded me with their uselessness.&quot; The poem sets a scene 
				soon to become familiar to Bukowski readers: stripped of hope 
				for work and seeing less sense in struggling with the average 
				man than dying as a no-sayer, the poem's protagonist remarks 
				upon the daily struggles of the desperate, finding some comfort, 
				finally, in the truths that allow him to understand their 
				frustration.</p>
				<p>Having received an eviction notice from a landlady, the poet 
				records his encounter with her: and I walked into a dark hall 
				where the landlady stood execrating and final, sending me to 
				hell, waving her fat, sweaty arms and screaming screaming for 
				rent because the world had failed us both.</p>
				<p>This final statement of the poem is made without self- pity 
				and without pity for the woman; it is matter-of-fact, a stance 
				that Bukowski's artistic distance from the subject allows. As 
				the poem's protagonist is drawn from Bukowski himself, the 
				distancing is all the more commendable. He constantly avoids, at 
				least in these early poems, overstating what he perceives as 
				facts of life. After first receiving the landlady's eviction 
				note, &quot;cracked in fine and / undemanding yellowness,&quot; for 
				instance, the poet calmly comments upon the situation: &quot;what was 
				needed now / was a good comedian, ancient style, a jester / with 
				jokes upon absurd pain; pain is absurd / because it exists, 
				nothing more&quot; (15). It is precisely the detachment of the 
				speaker, the lack of overt melodrama, in these early poems that 
				lends them their dramatic quality and that makes the general 
				pronouncements of the speaker, like &quot;pain is absurd / because it 
				exists,&quot; believable rather than pompous.</p>
				<p>&quot;the life of borodin&quot; is a fine early example of Bukowski's 
				empathetic abilities, his practice of holding up facts and 
				qualities in the lives of others as instances of an 
				individuality and endurance through hardship that is admirable, 
				and in which an obvious connection to the poet himself is 
				evident. But Bukowski is no ordinary eulogist. As with &quot;the 
				tragedy of the leaves,&quot; Bukowski's abstinence from melodrama or 
				overt praise saves the poems from being maudlin or <i>obvious</i>, 
				as Bukowski himself would say. And in &quot;the life of borodin,&quot; one 
				also witnesses the skillful reliance upon telling facts that 
				frees Bukowski from narrative flatulence. Remember, Bukowski 
				quietly exhorts the reader, Borodin &quot;was just a chemist / who 
				wrote music to relax; his house was jammed with people: / 
				students, artists, drunkards, bums, / and he never knew how to 
				say: no.&quot;</p>
				<p>Bukowski then recounts Borodin's childlike obsequiousness to 
				his wife. And he hints, in the juxtaposition of details, that 
				inner agony produces great art: &quot;she told him when to cut his 
				nails, / not to sing or whistle / or put too much lemon in his 
				tea / or press it with a spoon; / <i>Symphony #2, in B Minor</i> 
				/ <i>Prince Igor</i> / <i>On the Steppes of Central Asia</i> / 
				and he could sleep only by putting a piece / of dark cloth over 
				his eyes.&quot; The telling details of Borodin's inner struggle are 
				balanced perfectly in such lines with the stark details of the 
				insidious persecution he receives at home. By the end of the 
				poem, then, his fate is expected: &quot;in 1887 he attended a dance / 
				at the Medical Academy / dressed in a merrymaking costume; / at 
				last he seemed exceptionally gay / and when he fell to the 
				floor, / they thought he was clowning. / the next time you 
				listen to Borodin, / remember....&quot; But the emotional impact of 
				the poem is not diminished. For here, as in many other 
				empathetic poems, Bukowski does not tell but <i>show</i>; he 
				does not, essentially, preach to the reader. The reader is left 
				to interpret the poem, although of course led by the carefully 
				selected facts, and the only overt authorial presence is the 
				author's gentle recommendation to &quot;remember&quot; (19).</p>
				<p>&quot;borodin&quot; is, finally, as much a comment upon art itself as 
				upon Borodin. That is, at his emotional nadir, Borodin produced 
				powerful symphonies. One should note that even here, at this 
				early stage of Bukowsi's career, his theories of artistic merit 
				were not only formulated but practiced. And he has continues to 
				express them variously in poems up to the present. &quot;art,&quot; the 
				last poem in the 1979 book <i>Play the Piano Drunk Like a 
				Percussion Instrument Until the Fingers Begin to Bleed a Bit</i>, 
				articulates one of the lessons that &quot;the life of borodin&quot; taught 
				us. It reads simply, &quot;as the / spirit / wanes / the / form / 
				appears&quot; (125). So, of course, with Borodin.</p>
				<p>Yet there is an essential difference between a poem like &quot;borodin&quot; 
				and one like &quot;art,&quot; a difference that colors Bukowski's opus 
				much the same way it does that of other influential modern 
				poets, from Lawrence to Stevens and Moore. Taking &quot;borodin&quot; and 
				&quot;art&quot; together, one can see that &quot;borodin&quot;--like most of 
				Bukowski's empathetic poems--is illustrative of poetic theory, 
				and &quot;art&quot; is explanatory. Bukowski uses poetry, then, like 
				Lawrence did in many of the <i>Pansies</i>, like Stevens did in 
				&quot;Of Modern Poetry&quot; and many others, like Moore did in &quot;Poetry,&quot; 
				essentially to explain both his method and message in the 
				illustrative poems. Now whether this is a necessity is open to 
				debate. Generally, illustrative poems are always better accepted 
				critically, for they allow a degree of reader participation that 
				explanatory or declarative poems prevent. They <i>show</i> 
				rather than <i>tell</i>. <i>Pansies</i>, for example, were 
				Lawrence's most critically denounced poems; Stevens' &quot;Of Modern 
				Poetry&quot; and Moore's &quot;Poetry&quot; appear in most anthologies 
				generally so that students can compare their &quot;statements&quot; with 
				the practice evident in the poets' better-respected poems. &quot;Art&quot; 
				may someday, too, be placed in anthologies for this very reason. 
				The point I wish to make, however, is that Bukowski, contrary to 
				what some of his critics would have readers believe, is a 
				conscious craftsman with an ideology as well- developed as many 
				of our most respected poets.</p>
				<p>Bukowski has often said, as he did in a <i>South Bay</i> 
				interview of 1981, that &quot;Genius is the ability to say a profound 
				thing in a simple way&quot; (33). One could argue that the 
				implications of the philosophy--that saying something in a 
				&quot;simple&quot; way also entails its being said briefly--are what make 
				Bukowski first a poet and second a writer of fiction. He would 
				no doubt agree: &quot;I don't mean to make (poetry) holy,&quot; he says in
				<i>South Bay</i>. &quot;But it's #1. You don't play with it too 
				much...There's a little more intensity in the poem because I 
				have to say it in a shorter space&quot; (33).</p>
				<p>Definitions of &quot;shorter space,&quot; however, vary. Many of 
				Bukowski's story or narrative poems, which he has written from 
				the outset and which have brought him the most criticism from 
				readers used to the artificially tight but poetically 
				conventional diction of much modernist poetry, run for pages and 
				pages. Characteristic of Bukowski's story poems are a 
				deceptively easy, off-the-cuff tone, replete with qualifiers 
				like &quot;somehow,&quot; &quot;very,&quot; and &quot;rather,&quot; and plenty of simple 
				sentences combined almost always with coordinating conjunctions. 
				In short, Bukowski reproduces the language of the layman, the 
				language one might use during an articulate evening while 
				talking to a friend over a beer.</p>
				<p>One of the earliest examples of Bukowski's narrative or story 
				poems is &quot;a literary romance&quot; (<i>Burning in Water</i> 21- 22). 
				The tone immediately distinguishes itself from tighter, more 
				evocative poems like &quot;the tragedy of the leaves.&quot; Here are the 
				first four lines: &quot;I met her somehow through correspondence or 
				poetry or magazines / and she began sending me very sexy poems 
				about rape and lust, / and this being mixed in with a minor 
				intellectualism / confused me somewhat and I got in my car and 
				drove North....&quot; Bukowski proceeds North and tells a story about 
				his meeting with the woman with the very sexy poems, who was &quot;a 
				virgin, 35 years old&quot; and who had a life's work of &quot;ten or 
				twelve poems&quot; which the poet had to read. The narrator then 
				takes the woman to boxing matches, where he confirms that they 
				have nothing whatsoever in common. He leaves her, &quot;still a 
				virgin / and a very bad poetess.&quot; The poem concludes, as most of 
				Bukowski's story poems do, with a commentary upon the tale by 
				the narrator. This time, it's &quot;I think that when a woman has 
				kept her legs closed / for 35 years / it's too late / either for 
				love / or for / poetry.&quot;</p>
				<p>The frank, street-level language and the looseness of tone, 
				with line-breaks that seem totally arbitrary, along with a 
				conclusion that could easily be seen as no more than a crude 
				punchline, raised the brows of more than a few critics, and 
				continue to do so to this day. Joshua Kessler, reviewing for <i>
				Parnassus</i> in 1973, called Bukowski's poetry &quot;flat stuff 
				without one insight, without one flare-up of language, without 
				an interesting emotion, or even the attempt to devise a poem 
				structured to be conducive to an emotion,... (230). Hayden 
				Carruth, writing for <i>Harper's Magazine</i> in 1975, contended 
				that &quot;Whether or not Charles Bukowski's `poems' are actually 
				poems is open to legitimate debate, even after the loosening up 
				of our ideas about poetic form that has occurred in the past ten 
				or fifteen years&quot; (4). And even Robert Peters, one of the first 
				serious critics to write sympathetically of Bukowski, laments 
				the &quot;tiresome loquaciousness&quot; (28) that he saw as a recent 
				development in Bukowski's poetry in an article for <i>Margins</i> 
				in 1975. Peters charged that the poems moved as &quot;narrative 
				prose, cut up more or less projectively, into boozy 
				breath-groups. Nothing much of interest (poetically) catches the 
				ear...&quot; (28).</p>
				<p>It is true that in later books, especially in <i>Dangling in 
				the Tournefortia</i> (1981), Bukowski turns more often to the 
				narrative poem. But &quot;a literary romance,&quot; taken from the very 
				first full-length book of poetry, illustrates that Bukowski has 
				practiced this kind of poem from the outset. And as this kind of 
				poem shows the starkest break from the tenets of modern poetry, 
				which seem in large part those to which critics of Bukowski 
				adhere, they naturally cause the most consternation. 
				Furthermore, as the quotations above amply demonstrate, in 
				deciding whether such narratives as &quot;a literary romance&quot; can be 
				categorized as poetry or whether they are emotive or 
				&quot;interesting,&quot; critics have invariably failed to define the 
				terms upon which their arguments rest. They assume that the 
				condemning abstractions against which they prop their 
				arguments--i.e., what constitutes &quot;emotion,&quot; &quot;interest,&quot; or, 
				indeed, &quot;poetry&quot; itself--are universal givens. And they are, in 
				fact, <i>not</i> universal givens. Indeed, in pointing out that 
				&quot;our ideas about poetic form&quot; have loosened considerably in the 
				last fifteen years, Hayden Carruth unwittingly alludes to the 
				shaky foundations upon which our too-often unspoken criteria 
				rest.</p>
				<p>More than anything else, Charles Bukowski's narrative poetry 
				has reminded the literary public of just how man-made our 
				notions of &quot;good&quot; vs. &quot;bad&quot; poetry are. This has occurred much 
				to the disappointment of many literary critics and professors of 
				English, who, of course, have a stake in being able to &quot;profess&quot; 
				quality, to profess standards over which they preside. It has 
				occurred, on the other hand, much to the delight of thousands of 
				readers and writers previously soured by the theoretical, 
				opaque, or allusive qualities of much serious literature before 
				Bukowski. Countless little magazines of the present day are 
				literally filled with poets originally inspired by the loosening 
				up that poetry received at Bukowski's hands. And Bukowski does 
				write serious literature; of that there can be no doubt to those 
				who consider questions of class and sex relations, questions of 
				conformity and rebellion, questions of what constitutes bravery, 
				cowardice, love, and death of a serious nature. And that he 
				executes poems exploring these themes to the satisfaction of 
				arbiters of taste is attested to by his appearance in such 
				widely-used college-level anthologies as <i>The Norton Anthology 
				of Poetry</i> and <i>A Geography of Poets</i>. Theses and 
				dissertations have now been written on Bukowski; one scholarly 
				journal has devoted half an issue to his work; and academic 
				articles on Bukowski are appearing in learned journals with ever 
				greater frequency around the world.
