          <br>
          </font> <font size="3">A MILD SEPTEMBER morning. A man no longer young strolls thoughtfully 
          on a narrow footpath along a former railway line. Noises tell of a nearby 
          motorway but brambles, elders and hawthorns on each side hide all but 
          the straight empty path ahead until he sees a small clearing on his 
          right. Two girls sit here at the foot of an old telegraph pole. He pauses, 
          gazing up at the top of the pole, examining its cracked grey timber, 
          cross-pieces with insulators like small white jam pots from which dangle 
          broken wires. He has noticed the girls are in their teens, look surly 
          and depressed, wear clumsy thick-soled boots and baggy military trousers 
          from which rise pleasantly slim bodies. One says crossly, 'What are 
          you staring at?'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'At 
          the wires of that sad sad pole!' says the man without lowering his eyes, 
          'A few years ago they carried messages from this land of ours to a world-wide 
          commercial empire.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A few years? It was yonks ago,' 
          says the girl contemptuously. Without looking straight at her the man 
          glimpses a stud piercing her lower lip and one through the wing of a 
          nostril. He says, 'Yonks? Yes. I suppose this pole was defunct before 
          you were born.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continues looking up at it until 
          the other girl stands, stretches her arms, pretends to yawn, says 'I'll 
          better away,&#146; and goes off through the bushes. Her companion still 
          sits as she did before the stroller arrived.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minute later he takes a folded 
          newspaper from his coat pocket, unfolds it, lays it on the grass where 
          the departed girl sat, then sits carefully down with hands clasped round 
          the knee of a bent leg. Looking sideways at the girl (who still pretends 
          to ignore him) he says quietly, 'I must ask you a difficult question 
          about &#133; the eff word. Does it shock or annoy you? I don't mean 
          when used as a swear word, I hate swearing, I mean when used as a word 
          for the thing ... the act lovers do together. Eh?'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After allowing her a moment to reply 
          he speaks briskly as if they had reached an agreement.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Now I fully realize that a lovely 
          young woman like you -' (she sneers) '- don't sneer, has no wish to 
          eff with a boring old fart like me in bushes beside a derelict railway 
          line. But I suppose you are unemployed and need money?'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Fucking right I do!' she cries.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Don't swear. This is an unfair 
          world but I am no hypocrite, I am glad I have money you need. We should 
          therefore discuss how much I am willing to pay for what you are prepared 
          to do. I promise that a wee chat will probably give all the satisfaction 
          I need. I have never been greatly enamoured with the down-to-earth, 
          flat-out business of effing.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Ten pounds!' says the girl, facing 
          him at last. He nods and says, 'That is not unreasonable.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Ten pounds now! Nothing without 
          cash up front!' she says, holding out a hand. From a wallet within his 
          coat he gives her bank notes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Thanks,' she says, pocketing them 
          and standing up, 'Cheerio.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks up at her wistfully. She 
          says, 'You're too weird for me as well as too old and you're right. 
          This is an unfair world.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She goes off through the bushes. 
          He sighs and sits there, brooding.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then hears a rustling of leaves. 
          The other girl emerges and stands watching him. He ignores her until 
          she says, 'I didnae really go away. I was listening all the time behind 
          that bush I don't think you're weird. Not dangerous-weird. You're just 
          ... funny.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Name?' he asks drearily.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Davida.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I thought the Scottish custom of 
          making daughters' names out of fathers' names had died out.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It came back. What's your name?'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I'm giving nothing else away today, 
          Davida. Don't expect it.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is looking at her. She grins 
          cheerily back until he shrugs and pats the grass beside him. She hunkers 
          down slightly further away, hugging her legs with both arms and asking 
          brightly, 'What were you going to say to Sharon?'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You too want cash from me.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Aye, some, but not as much as Sharon. 
          Forget about money. Say what you like, I won't mind.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stares at her, opens his mouth, 
          swallows, shuts his eyes tight and mutters 'Bigpocketswithbuttonedflaps.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Eh?'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Big,' he explains deliberately, 
          'Pockets. With. Buttoned. Flaps. At last I have said it.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They turn you on?' says Davida, 
          looking at her pockets in a puzzled way.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yes!' he says defiantly, 'Because 
          violence is sexy! These pockets are military pockets with room for ammunition 
          clips and grenades and iron rations. On women they look excitingly . 
          . . deliciously . . . unsuitable.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yes, I suppose that's why they're 
          in fashion, but they're nothing to get excited about.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I enjoy being excited about them,' 
          he groans, covering his face with his hands.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Were you a school teacher?'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You'll get nothing more out of 
          me, Davida ... Why do you think I was a teacher?'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Because you're bossy as well as 
          polite. Yes, and teachers have to pretend to be better than normal folk 
          so they're bound to go a bit daft when they retire. What did you want 
          to do with Sharon's pockets that was worth ten quid?'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks obstinately away from her.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Did you want to stick your hands 
          in them like THIS?' she giggles, putting her hands in her 
          pockets, 'Did you want to fumble about in them like THIS?'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No more dirty talk!' orders a very 
          tall thin youth emerging from the bushes, 'How dare you molest this 
          young lady with obscene and suggestive insinuations?'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'ME molest HER? Ha!' cries the man 
          and lies back flat on the grass with hands clasped behind head. He thinks 
          it wise to look as relaxed and unchallenging as possible for he is now 
          greatly outnumbered. Beside the tall youth is a small youth who looks 
          more menacing because his face is expressionless, his head completely 
          bald, and beside him stands Sharon saying scornfully, 'Big pockets with 
          buttoned flaps!'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You should have left us alone a 
          bit longer,' grumbles Davida, 'He was starting to enjoy himself.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He was starting to enjoy his antisocial 
          fetishistic propensities with a lassie young enough to be his grand-daughter!' 
          cries the tall youth fiercely.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Molesting two lassies in fifteen 
          minutes!' says Sharon, 'We've witnesses to prove it. He's got to pay 
          us for that.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man says, 'I've paid you already.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That ... is not an attitude ... 
          I would advocate if you want to stay in one piece,' says the tall boy, 
          slowly taking from a big pocket in his trousers a knife with a long 
          blade. The smaller, more dangerous-looking youth says 'Hullo Mr McCorquodale.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man sits up to see him better 
          and asks, 'How's the family Shon?'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dad isnae out yet but Sheila's 
          doing well in TV rentals. She went to Australia.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yes, Sheila was the smartest of 
          you. I advised her to leave Scotland.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I KNEW he was a teacher,' says 
          Davida smugly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You stupid fucking cretin!' the 
          tall boy yells at the shorter one, 'If you'd kept out the way we could 
          have rolled him for all he's got, buggered off and nothing would have 
          happened! We don't live round here, we've no police record, nobody could 
          have found us! But now he knows you we'll have to evade identification by cutting 
          off his head and hands and burying them miles away!'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saws the air wildly with the 
          knife. The girls' faces express disgust. The smaller youth says mildly 
          'Don't do that to old Corky, he wasnae one of the worst.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Not one of the worst?' cries the 
          ex-teacher jumping lightly to his feet, 'Did I not make my gym a living 
          hell for you and your brothers? I also advise YOU,' he tells the taller 
          youth, 'to put that knife away. You obviously don't know how to handle 
          it.'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And you do?' says the tall boy 
          sarcastically.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yes son, I do. I belong to the 
          generation that did National Service. Your combat training is all from 
          television and video games. When eighteen I was taught armed AND unarmed 
          combat by professional killers in the British army. Davida! Sharon! 
          Shon! Persuade your friend to pocket that bread knife. Tell him he's 
          a fine big fellow but I'm stronger than I look and if he's really interested 
          in dirty fighting I can teach him tricks that'll have the eyes popping 
          out of his head. Tell him I gave Sharon all the money I carry so if 
          he needs more he'll have to come home with me.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And McCorquodale smiles wistfully 
          at the tall youth's combat trousers.</font></td>
