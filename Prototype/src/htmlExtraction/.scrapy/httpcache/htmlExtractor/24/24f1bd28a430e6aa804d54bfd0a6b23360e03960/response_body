<p>David Hannah was recruited to Reliance by longtime CEO William T. Gimbel, with whom he had established a close working relationship while leading the independent audit by Ernst &amp; Whinney (now Ernst &amp; Young LLP). He joined Reliance as its first Chief Financial Officer in 1981. After nearly a decade in the office, David exchanged his suit for a hard hat and safety goggles and spent a year as Division Manager of Reliance Steel Company in Los Angeles, gaining firsthand operational experience. Upon returning to headquarters, David&rsquo;s duties continued to increase: he was appointed a Director in 1992, served as President from 1995-2002, and has held his current role of Chief Executive Officer since 1999. He has further served Reliance as Chairman of the Board since 2007.</p>
<p>Having been with the company for over 30 years now, David considers that he has grown up here, mentored by past leaders, and has directed several significant Reliance milestones. These include the company&rsquo;s 1994 IPO, its entry in <em>Fortune </em>magazine&rsquo;s list of top 500 companies, and the completion of over 50 acquisitions, resulting in Reliance&rsquo;s robust performance, profitability, and top position in the metals service center industry. Under David&rsquo;s leadership, Reliance has come to be known industry wide as the Acquirer of Choice. He continues to be an officer and active board member of the Metals Service Center Institute, where he served as Chairman of the Board from May 2013 to May 2015.</p>
<p>In May 2015, Dave Hannah stepped down as Reliance&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer, yet remained active in the day-to-day operations of the company as Executive Chairman of the Board. He retired from this position in July 2016 but continues to serve as a Reliance Board Member.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Gregg Mollins&nbsp;calls himself a &ldquo;field man&rdquo;: he relishes meeting, interacting with, and &ndash; now, with 39 years&rsquo; experience &ndash; mentoring the people whose hard work and dedication make Reliance what it is. Admittedly &ldquo;not one for the books,&rdquo; Gregg directed his problem-solving instincts towards the metals business at a very young age. Starting off as a warehouseman, he worked his way up, not shying away from new opportunities or challenges, and thus gaining experience in all aspects of the business. After a decade of working for the company&rsquo;s competitors, Gregg joined the Reliance team as a Division Manager in Santa Clara. In five years he was able to turn the faltering division into a profitable operation, after which he was promoted to Reliance corporate headquarters as Vice President and understudy of longtime President Joe Crider. As leadership shifted following Reliance&rsquo;s IPO, Gregg became Chief Operating Officer in 1995. He joined the Board of Directors in 1997, and since 2002 he has served as the company&rsquo;s President, to whom all Senior Vice Presidents report. Gregg&lsquo;s hands-on approach keeps his travel schedule busy, and, especially as Reliance continues to grow, he continues to enjoy engaging with Reliance family members in person and Reliance operations on the ground. In May 2015, he succeeded David Hannah as Reliance&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Growing up in Pittsburgh, home of the American steel industry, <strong>Jim Hoffman</strong> practically had steel in his veins. Summer jobs in local steel mills were the norm, yet this experience, though grounding him in the basics of the industry, taught him that he actually didn&rsquo;t want to work in a steel mill. Despite his best efforts to avoid it, though, Jim found himself gaining more experience in steel and other metals. It was the sales and operations sides of the business, however, which piqued his interest and allowed him to apply his degree in Advertising and Marketing. After 11 years with United States Steel Corporation, Jim went on to a 17-year career with Earle M. Jorgensen Company, rising to the position of Chief Operating Officer in Chicago. EMJ was acquired by Reliance in 2006, and two years later Jim relocated to the West Coast to assume the position of Senior Vice President of Operations at Reliance&rsquo;s corporate office. Now, as Executive Vice President &amp; Chief Operating Officer, he&nbsp;oversees all of Reliance's operating businesses. Jim is also a Director at the Metals Service Center Institute.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A dissatisfying stint as a stock broker trainee caused <strong>Stephen P. Koch</strong> to apply for an open position at Chapel Steel; he was hired as Chapel&rsquo;s first full-time sales representative. In this new capacity he discovered that fulfilling customer needs while building relationships was tangible and rewarding, both personally and professionally. Steve&rsquo;s success in sales led him to the buying side of the business, where he developed mill relationships to satisfy the increasing demand for steel plate, Chapel&rsquo;s specialty. Over a 22-year career, he played an integral role in Chapel&rsquo;s expansion, and rose to serve as Executive Vice President and President after the company was acquired by Reliance in 2005. Steve transitioned to Reliance&rsquo;s corporate office to take on the position of Senior Vice President of Operations in 2010. Drawing from mentors, peers, and the larger Reliance family as well as his own reserve of experience, he enjoys the continued challenges, successes, and opportunities ahead for the diverse subsidiaries and divisions which he oversees.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A degree in Engineering helped <strong>Bill Sales</strong> land his first job out of college with Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corporation. Beginning with engineering individual pieces for specific projects, Bill then gained valuable exposure to and experience in the production and sales departments. Over a 16-year tenure, he gained increasingly broader bases of knowledge and responsibility from which to make strategic decisions that affected the company. His knowledge of the supply side of the metals industry made Bill a great fit to head up Reliance&rsquo;s non-ferrous operations, of which he took the helm in 1997. As Reliance increased its portfolio of specialty metals service centers, Bill&rsquo;s experience has been instrumental, from both strategic acquisition and operational standpoints. Having been with Reliance for over 15 years, Bill now maintains operations oversight of numerous Reliance&rsquo;s subsidiaries and divisions. In May 2015, he was promoted to the position of Executive Vice President of Operations. Additionally, he has been a director at the Metals Service Center Institute since 2011, and is the Chair of its Aluminum Products Division Council.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon the advice of a local CPA, <strong>Karla Lewis</strong> decided to become an accountant when she was in elementary school. She stayed the course, leaving the small farming town she grew up in to earn a BS in Business at Ohio State University, and later became a certified public accountant. A turning point came when Karla &ndash; unlike her peers, who opted to stay local or go to the East Coast &ndash; chose to do an internship in Los Angeles. When she graduated, the company (Ernst &amp; Young, LLP) hired her full time, and she made her permanent move west. One of her first clients was Reliance Steel &amp; Aluminum Co.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working on-site while conducting the independent audit, Karla had the opportunity to interact with many Reliance employees, both at the corporate headquarters and at some Reliance divisions. The insight she gleaned into Reliance&rsquo;s unique culture influenced Karla&rsquo;s decision to accept the position of Corporate Controller in 1992. Reliance was attractive not just because of the quality of people, but the opportunities for ongoing learning and development. In her two decades with Reliance, Karla has done just that. From Vice President and Corporate Controller, she progressively moved to Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and, from 2002 to 2015, served Reliance as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In May 2015, Karla was promoted to Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, she sits on the Board of Directors of the Metals Service Center Institute.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s not certain whether his father&rsquo;s career in the foundry business influenced <strong>Mike Shanley&rsquo;s</strong> start in the metals industry, or whether it was just a matter of chance and timing. After landing a temporary plant position at Liebovich Bros., Inc. in Rockford, Illinois, though, he didn&rsquo;t look back and he didn&rsquo;t leave. A rarity even in an industry of many &ldquo;old timers,&rdquo; Mike Shanley has spent his entire career at Liebovich &ndash; actively participating in and even shepherding the company&rsquo;s growth; in many ways, he himself grew up with the company. After working his way up the company ranks and gaining invaluable experience along the way, Mike became Vice President and General Manager of one of Liebovich Bros.&rsquo; divisions, Hagerty Steel &amp; Aluminum. Having served four years in that position, he was then elevated to the presidency of Liebovich in 2009. Beginning in April 2015, Mike took on the role of one of Reliance&rsquo;s Senior Vice President of Operations. He is responsible for overseeing the operations of a number of Reliance subsidiaries and divisions. As Mike continues his career in metals, his experience of having worked for and with some of the best people in the industry will be one of his most valuable resources, one he seeks to constantly renew and also draw from to share with others.</p>
