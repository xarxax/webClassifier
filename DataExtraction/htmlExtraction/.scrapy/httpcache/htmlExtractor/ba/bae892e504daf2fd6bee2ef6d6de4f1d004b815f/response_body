<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a time in this country when
bright young men did not dream of directing films or
inventing software. They wanted to write: books,&nbsp;
fiction--what
some liked to call &quot;The Great American Novel.&quot; This generation included
Gore Vidal whose grandfather had been an august senator and James Jones,
a self-taught prodigy out of the Midwest--but none was brighter--nor more
driven--than Norman Mailer.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Born in 1923, the son of a South African Jew, and an
adoring mother, Mailer was given the middle name Kingsley-- after malech, Hebrew for
king. Later, his mother said, "I thought Norman was perfect"--an opinion she held
throughout life. (Peter Manso, Mailer: <i> His Life and Times</i>, New York,  Penguin Books, 1985) But Mailer's father was
a struggling accountant, and the young prince grew up working class--in the grimy New York
borough of Brooklyn. The streets of Crown Heights during the Depression provided some education--with their hardness,
neighborhood rivalries, and "fug you too" philosophy. No wonder in later years Norman would survive
decades of literary wars and misalliances. But as the son of ambitious parents, Norman may have
learned that survival skills are not an entree into the Establishment--for that a degree was required
and a classy one too. So, like many city boys, Norman burned up the public school competition and
enrolled in Harvard--determined, at 17, to become-- as he put it--a "major writer."&nbsp;&nbsp;His 
tuition was paid by a rich uncle, a chocolate manufacturer who had invented the 
chocolate covered cherry.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Norman found that Harvard was divided by
more than just quadrangles. The school was run by scions of old families, prep school
graduates--an elite, arrogant crowd that later crowned themselves, "The WASPS." In rare
(or maybe not so rare) moments of self-pity, Mailer would tell intimates that at Harvard he
lacked the right clothes, the right accent, the right religion.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Norman Kingsley Mailer's four years in
Cambridge were very ordinary. He wrote for the school literary magazine, boxed, and played
dormitory football. Later, he would boast that he had been "a bit of an athlete," in his John
Garfield, tough alley style. Then, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, America was at war,
and Mailer wondered which theater, Europe or Asia, he would write his novel about.
</font>

<font face="Times New Roman">Still, Norman was in no hurry to join up. After 
graduation in 1943, he returned home to Brooklyn (with a B.A. in engineering, 
cum laude) worked on a novel about a summer job he had had in a Boston mental 
hospital, and waited for Uncle Sam to call. Finally, in 1945 he was inducted, 
assigned to a Texas National Guard unit that had been mobilized, and was 
shipped to the Philippines, landing on Luzon at the tail end of the campaign.</font></p>

<font SIZE="2">
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
the South Pacific, Norman strung telephone lines for the engineer corps and took 
part in skirmishes with the retreating Japanese. A fellow soldier later 
remembered that Private Mailer &quot;had more combat with his supervisors than he did 
with the enemy.&quot; After the war ended, Norman spent a few months as a cook with 
the U.S. occupation forces in Japan.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Following his discharge, Norman returned home to write his novel, a fictionalized account
of a Pacific battle. He called the book, <i> The Naked and the Dead</i>--an epic
title he had previously used for a play at Harvard. The story was about a tough 
three day patrol behind enemy lines that had taken place before Mailer joined 
the unit but that he had heard about from those who survived.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mailer's book was a huge success, and he
was lionized by the press in that pre-television era in a
way that no first novelist would be today. There were only
a few stray dissenters (whose number, however, would grow over the years).
Mary McCarthy called the novel redolent of &quot;ambition&quot;--as opposed to talent--and young Gore Vidal found the story a rerun of Dos
Passos--a &quot;fake,&quot; even. But in 1948, at the age
of 25, Norman Mailer was famous.</font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoping to sell his book to the movies,
Norman headed to Hollywood. The film colony did not roll
out the welcome mat. Producer Sam Goldwyn showed up at a
meeting in his bathrobe and lectured the young author on screen writing.
When no major studio optioned his book, Mailer worked on an original
screenplay with his friend, Jean Malaquais, and soaked up
the local color. (Otto Friedrich, <i>City of Nets</i>, London,
Headline House,1988 ed.)</font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The screenplay remained unproduced, and
Mailer turned to another novel, <i>The Deer Park</i>, which
appeared to be a fictionalized account of director Elia Kazan's
troubles with HUAC - the Congressional investigating committee--as well
as Mailer's own remembrances of Goldwyn. The book had a weird sexuality--one
minor character was a homosexual pimp--and, for a time, there were
doubts it would be published. Supposedly, Alfred Knopf, the patrician publisher,
asked an editor in disdain, &quot;Is this your idea of the kind of book which
should bear a Borzoi imprint?&quot; ( Norman Mailer, <i> Advertisements for</i> <i>Myself</i>, New York, Berkley Books, 1970 ed.)</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When published in 1955, <i> The Deer Park</i> sold only moderately well and was widely panned: One reviewer called it, "The year's worst snake pit in fiction." Another critic found the plot "crummy" and "sordid." (Over the years, however, the book acquired a cult following that would include a UCLA film student named Jim Morrison.) But, by the time the novel was published, Norman had moved beyond Hollywood and Madison Avenue. Bestsellerdom was no longer his shtick. The "Psychic Outlaw" was Mailer's new hero; he became the prophet of hip. Along with several friends, Norman co-founded
<i> The Village Voice</i> and published manifestoes in small circulation journals. </font></p>
</font>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first Mailer acted as <i>Voice</i> 
circulation manager, then wrote a puffed up column on his new philosophy. Other 
staff members found him overbearing, egotistical, inconsiderate. Dan Wolf, a <i>
Voice</i> co-founder, told him: &quot;Norman, for a socialist, you're acting like the 
worst capitalist in the world.&quot; (Hillary Mills, <i>Mailer: A Biography</i>, New 
York, Empire Books, 1982)</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Mailer blew up over a typo, 
editor Wolf canceled the column, and Norman was off the <i>Voice</i>. &quot;He was 
bullying everybody,&quot; a confrere complained, but this setback did not slow Norman 
down.</font></p>

<font SIZE="2">
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sex, politics, drugs--in different
combinations and various configurations--were throughout
the 1950s favorite Mailer themes. He wrote a short story
about a college girl's (involuntary) encounter with anal intercourse
(which led some early feminists to question Norman's own sexuality)--and
romanticized marijuana as &quot;the smoke of the assassins.&quot; (This was
before Lee Harvey Oswald made the scene.)</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; In an essay entitled, <i> The
White Negro</i>, Mailer took on the complicated subject of
race relations. Unfortunately, Norman's dialectical insight went over
some people's heads. After reading the essay, James Baldwin, the great black
novelist, confessed: &quot;I could not, with the best will in the world, make
any sense out of <i> The White Negro</i>.&quot; (James Baldwin, <i> Nobody Knows My
Name</i>,
 New York, Dell Books, 1978 ed.)</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; But for Norman, the 1950s
were only a foretaste of the adulation that covered him in
the 1960s; that unrestful era was &quot;the time of his time.&quot; Meetings,
protests, marches--Norman Mailer was everywhere. It was as though LBJ
had conjured up the Vietnam War for Norman--and God then sent him Nixon. At
one cocktail party Norman challenged McGeorge Bundy, LBJ's foreign policy adviser, to a fistfight. The bespectacled State Department official
declined. Apparently, there were no Green Berets around
for Norman to take on.</font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, Mailer could do no wrong; his home-movies were shown in art houses and
   applauded by critics. He won a Pulitzer Prize (1969) for <em>The Armies of the Night</em>--a
   journalistic novel in which he was the main character in the march on the Pentagon
   to stop the war. The technique of writing of himself in the third person--Mailer did
   this, Mailer said that--was borrowed from Henry Adams that Boston Brahmin hipster
   (and anti-Semite) whose 1918 autobiography was a Harvard bible. Two world class
   protesters, Robert Lowell and Dwight Macdonald, were accorded supporting roles in
   the anti-Pentagon saga. Macdonald, in fact, had been protesting everything--World
   War II, capitalism, the <em>Third Edition of Webster's Unabridged Dictionary</em>, even--
   for years. Of Lowell, Mailer wrote: "You, Lowell, beloved poet of many, what do you
   know of the dirt and the dark deliveries of the necessary?" Political correctness
   was not yet in vogue--but it was hardly Norman's turgid prose that also earned
   him the National Book Award that year.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In politics, as in art, fashions change.  With the advent
of Ronald Reagan, Mailer's career steadily went into decline. The Great Communicator filled
the entire arena. There was no room on stage for side shows or freaks. Mailer tried but his potboilers and a coffee table biography
of Marilyn Monroe failed to regain his early fame. The Monroe book was launched at a press conference at
the Algonquin Hotel--the literary landmark where Dorothy Parker and her circle had exchanged witticisms and
repartee. Norman revealed that the theme of his study was that the right wing had murdered the
sex goddess to frame Attorney General Robert Kennedy. The ghosts of the Round Table 
must
have had fun with that one. A more earthly critic, John Simon, described the 
biography as &quot;very demented.&quot; Even worse, Diana Trilling, the den mother of the Upper West Side critics, chided Norman for writing the book for money.</font></p> <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it became known that Mailer's book on capital punishment
(<i>The Executioner's Song</i>) had been based upon another's research, Truman Capote
commented that Norman &quot;...was just a rewrite man like you have over at the <i>Daily
News</i>.&quot; (Lawrence Grobel, <i> Conversations with Capote</i>, New York, NAL Books, 1985)</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; Being on the wrong side of
history can happen to anyone. But these times must be
especially galling for Norman Mailer. Old comrades now style themselves
&quot;neo-conservatives&quot; and write on social issues for right wing journals.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The &quot;shit storm&quot; that Norman
predicted in the sixties never materialized. Instead of
finding himself in old age a prophet, Norman has become--in the classic
put down of that era--marginalized and irrelevant.</font> </p>
