<blockquote>
In this first passage, Kaiser characterizes the group of 
reactionary literary critics who became known as the "New 
Critics," among them Cleanth Brooks, Robert Penn Warren, and John 
Crowe Ransom.
</blockquote>
 <p>

Robert Penn Warren's vicious, racist piece about Negroes was 
called "The Briar Patch."  Cleanth Brooks is also a southerner.  
These critics and their disciples, who had competition during the 
socially conscious 1930's, gained complete control of the 
literature departments of the universities and the literary 
quarterlies after World War II in the 1940's, and are still in 
control today.  These critics, writing a close and difficult, 
objective, "scientific," line-by-line, word after word criticism 
of the structural properties of poetry and fiction, apply 
psychology to form, regard a poem as an entity or end in itself, 
with its own kind of knowledge imbedded in its form and style 
regardless of subject matter.  They are art for art's sakers in 
the extreme.  Allen Tate, in <i>Reason in Madness</i> (1941), attacks the 
social sciences as a fundamental menace in general, and the use of 
history and the physical, biological, social and political 
sciences as a danger to criticism in particular.  Ransom has also 
attacked the use of science and the social sciences, such as 
anthropology and psychology, in criticism while using them all in 
his criticism.  Addison Gayle, Jr., in "Cultural Hegemony:  The 
Southern White Writer and American Letters" (<i>Amistad</i> 1, 1970), 
calls these agrarian critics, poets and fictionists southern 
aristocrats and anti-democratic racists for whom "a poem or novel, 
like a well-wrought urn, was an 'autotelic structure,' governed by 
inner rules and conforming to verbal structures which only the 
chosen few could analyze or interpret.  The function of the writer 
was not, as Henry Fielding had believed, to instruct, but to 
produce masterpieces which would satisfy the aesthetic tastes of 
the cultured elite." <p>
<blockquote>
[<i>John Crowe Ransom, one of the "New Critics" just 
mentioned, <a href=ransom-quote.html>preferred his art "cool"</a>
(read: cold).  Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren's 
published <a href=understanding-poetry.html><i>Understanding
Poetry</i></a>, a New Critical poetry textbook that helped create the
critical power Kaiser is decrying here.</i> 
<p>
Now Kaiser turns to Ellison, whom he sees as implicated in/with 
the New Critical movement:] 
</blockquote>
<p>

The creative writing called for by the New Critics, and the work 
produced by the writers who follow the New Critics' rules and 
criteria, are enormously controlled, cerebral and studies.  
Ellison called writing, in his <i>Harper's</i> (March 1967) interview, "a 
very stern discipline."  The spontaneity is strictly controlled 
and within the patterns set up in the beginning.  The effects are 
worked out in advance.  This kind of writing, unemotional, 
uncommitted and uninvolved in the people's problems, is a cop-out 
and an escape in the heartbreak house of a dying, exploiting, 
murdering capitalistic society.  It is the antithesis of 
progressive writing and art committed to and concerned with the 
people's problems and struggles and dedicated to throwing some 
light on helping to solve the people's problems and to ushering in 
a better society shaped to human needs rather than to 
exploitation, profits, poverty and wars. <p>
<blockquote>
[Now Kaiser turns directly to <i>Invisible Man</i>.  He writes:] <p>
</blockquote>
All good, honest fiction writers create basically out of their own 
experiences, reworking and embroidering as they build their works.  
Historical fiction has history as a factual base to build upon.  
Good fiction has to be experienced and lived.  It cannot be 
contrived and created from symbols and myths as the formalists and 
the New Critics demand.  But Ellison has done this in writing the 
novel, <i>Invisible Man</i>.  He says, in an interview in <i>Shadow and 
Act</i>, that the social realists are concerned with injustice, but that he 
is concerned not with injustice to Blacks but with tragedy and 
art.  He explains the genesis of his novel in this same interview:  
"I was reading Lord Raglan's <i>The Hero</i> [about mythic heroes] and 
thing about [white-picked black leaders].  The symbols and their 
connections were known to me.  I began it with a chart of the 
three-part division.  It was a conceptual frame with most of the 
ideas and some incidents indicated.  The three parts represent the 
narrative's movement from, using Kenneth Burke's terms, purpose to 
passion to perception.  These three major sections are built up to 
smaller units of three which mark the course of the action and 
which depend for their development upon what I hoped was a 
consistent and developing motivation.  However, you'll note that 
the maximum insight on the hero's part isn't reached until the 
final section.  After all, it's a novel about innocence and human 
error, a struggle through illusion to reality."  The hero's 
identity or social role is always defined by others and they kept 
him running, Ellison said.  His enlightenment and some voice in 
his destiny came when the hero got rid of his old identities and 
illusions.  Written during the period of communist hysteria and 
McCarthyism, Ellison had his innocent Black hero tricked by so-
called Communist duplicity.  The book devotes far more space to 
this one thing that it does to any of the other injustices visited 
upon the hero by whites.  "The hero's invisibility is not a matter 
of being seen," says Ellison, "but a refusal to run the risk of 
his own humanity, which involves guilt.  This is not an attack 
upon white society!  It is what the hero refuses to do in each 
section which leads to further action.  He must assert and achieve 
his own humanity;  he cannot run with the pack and do this--this 
is the reason for all the reversals." <p>

So there you have the explanation of the novel from the author 
himself.  It is not about whites' not seeing Blacks or injustices 
against Blacks.  It is not about Black protest or Black struggle 
against injustice. <p>

The critic, <a href=wald-on-howe.html>Irving Howe</a>, goes along with the 
other 
critics on Eliot, Pound, Yeats and the rest.  But when he published his 
essay, "Black Boys and Native Sons" (<i>Dissent</i>, Autumn l963; 
included later in A World More Attractive, 1963), in which he 
sided with Richard Wright (who said that only through struggle 
could Black men and all oppressed humanity achieve their humanity) 
and chided James Baldwin and Ellison for turning away from social 
fiction and toward willed affirmation despite oppression, he 
really made Ellison angry.  Howe, not knowing Negro life, is taken 
in somewhat by Invisible Man, its technique and talent.  But he 
says that Ellison tries to satisfy the New Critics by writing 
objectively, unemotionally about Black experience and he fails; 
that his anti-Communism is laid on too thickly to be believed; and 
that the hero's world of infinite possibilities at the end of the 
novel is simply incredible; that the social oppression of Blacks 
remained.  Ellison answered Howe in <i>The New Leader</i> (Dec. 9, 1963); 
Howe replied, and Ellison rejoined in <i>The New Leader</i> (Feb. 3, 
1964). Ellison's pieces are combined in <i>Shadow and Act</i> (1964). 
With a Niagara of words, with innuendoes and rationalizations 
aplenty, he tries to justify his nightmarish, escapist; surreal, 
nonsocial protest, existential novel. But it is to no avail. That 
a white critic has to ask him about the lack of protest against 
Black oppression in his novel embarrasses us all.  Ellison tries 
to destroy Wright and his social view in fiction. But here again 
Ellison is speaking for the somewhat insulated, educated Black 
middle class in the South. He says he fears the Left more than he 
fears the murdering state of Mississippi.  He says that Blacks are 
not pressuring him to join the Freedom Movement and that his inane 
reply to Howe is action in the struggle for Black freedom! <p>

The white critics, Robert Bone and Stanley Edgar Hyman, agreed 
with Ellison against Howe.  But Black writer James Walker's "What 
Do You Say Now, Ralph Ellison?" (<i>Black Creation</i>, Summer 1970) says 
that while white critics praise Ellison highly, "Black students of 
literature only grudgingly mention his name if at all and 
<i>Invisible Man</i> is not rated highly as a meaningful novel dealing 
with the Black experience.  There is a sense of anger with Ellison 
that he has sold out, that he has not dealt with things as they 
are, that he says little to Black people today and that he is 
dated in his outlook...[that] part of the current dissatisfaction 
with Ellison centers largely on his vision of Black people as an 
integral part of a society controlled by whites.  Current-day 
thinking rejects this viewpoint, and asserts that the image of the 
Black man is not controlled by or subject to the whims of 
whites...Blackness will not and should not be defined in white 
terms...There is in Invisible Man a sense of accommodation and 
willingness to try and change the prevalent white views...this is 
out-of-date with the current mood of young Black people in 
general." <p>

Ellison doesn't like militant Black protest writing but he loves 
James Alan McPherson's book of short stories <i>Hue and Cry</i> (1969), 
which is about lonely, confused, used, discarded, wronged people 
who don't fight back.  McPherson's experience, as he says, is very 
small and extremely limited here.  The stories are cold, cruel, 
inhuman, analytical, uncaring tales about niggers and bitches 
(that is, women).  Using sex-obsessed characters who are mostly 
Uncle Toming to make it and fighting each other, McPherson tells 
about these pathetic little experiences of defeated people (only 
the narrator-author does all right) in the hard-boiled objective, 
sadistic style of Horace McCoy, James M. Cain and other American 
writers.  And like <i>Invisible Man</i>, he has quite a bit about the 
Brotherhood (read Communist Party).  Ellison says that McPherson 
will never be an embarrassment to such people of excellence as 
Duke Ellington and Leontyne Price; that he is a most gifted writer 
of insight, sympathy and humor.  These mean, trivial, naturalistic 
stories are a real embarrassment to sensitive, full-of-feeling 
artists like Miss Price and Ellington.  They left me with a bad 
taste in my mouth and a feeling one gets from wallowing in manure.  
No day of triumph here. <p>
