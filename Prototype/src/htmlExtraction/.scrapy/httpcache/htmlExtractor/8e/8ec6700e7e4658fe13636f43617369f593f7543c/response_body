<h3>Andrew Marvell, &quot;On Mr. Milton's Paradise Lost&quot; (1674--poetic
preface to the second edition)</h3>
</center>When I beheld the Poet blind, yet bold,<br>
In slender Book his vast Design unfold,<br>
<i>Messiah</i> Crown'd, <i>Gods</i> Reconcil'd Decree,<br>
Rebelling <i>Angels</i>, the Forbidden Tree,<br>
Heav'n, Hell, Earth, Chaos, All; the Argument<br>
Held me a while misdoubting his Intent,<br>
That he would ruine (for I saw him strong)<br>
The sacred Truths to Fable and old Song,<br>
(So <i>Sampson</i> groap'd the Temples Posts in spight)<br>
The World o'rewhelming to revenge his Sight.<br>
Yet as I read, soon growing less severe,<br>
I lik'd his Project, the success did fear;<br>
Through that wide Field how he his way should find<br>
O're which lame Faith leads Understanding blind;<br>
Lest he perplext the things he would explain,<br>
And what was easie he should render vain.<br>
Or if a Work so infinite he spann'd,<br>
Jealous I was that some less skilful hand<br>
(Such as disquiet alwayes what is well,<br>
And by ill imitating would excell)<br>
Might hence presume the whole Creations day<br>
To change in Scenes, and show it in a Play.<br>
Pardon me, <i>Mighty Poet</i>, nor despise<br>
My causeless, yet not impious, surmise.<br>
But I am now convinc'd, and none will dare<br>
Within thy Labours to pretend a Share.<br>
Thou hast not miss'd one thought that could be fit,<br>
And all that was improper dost omit:<br>
So that no room is here for Writers left,<br>
But to detect their Ignorance or Theft.<br>
That Majesty which through thy Work doth Reign<br>
Draws the Devout, deterring the Profane.<br>
And things divine thou treats of in such state<br>
As them preserves, and Thee in violate.<br>
At once delight and horrour on us seize,<br>
Thou singst with so much gravity and ease;<br>
And above humane flight dost soar aloft,<br>
With Plume so strong, so equal, and so soft.<br>
The <i>Bird</i> nam'd from that <i>Paradise</i> you sing<br>
So never Flags, but alwaies keeps on Wing.<br>
Where couldst thou Words of such a compass find?<br>
Whence furnish such a vast expense of Mind?<br>
Just Heav'n Thee, like <i>Tiresias</i>, to requite,<br>
Rewards with <i>Prophesie</i> thy loss of Sight.<br>
Well might thou scorn thy Readers to allure<br>
With tinkling Rhime, of thy own Sense secure;<br>
While the <i>Town-Bays</i> writes all the while and spells,<br>
And like a Pack-Horse tires without his Bells.<br>
Their Fancies like our bushy Points appear,<br>
The Poets tag them; we for fashion wear.<br>
I too transported by the <i>Mode</i> offend,<br>
And while I meant to <i>Praise</i> thee, must Commend.<br>
Thy verse created like thy <i>Theme</i> sublime,<br>
In Number, Weight, and Measure, needs not <i>Rhime</i>.
