<p>Astroboy was called Tetsuwan Atom in Japan. The black and white series was created,
animated <img src="Astroboy150A4.gif" align="right" hspace="2" vspace="2" width="168" height="251">and produced by Osamu Tezuka (1928-1989) through his own company named Mushi
Productions. Tezuka, like his father, was a qualified doctor of medicine but was more
interested in drawing. Astroboy was a successful comic strip in Japan in the 50&#146;s. It
was released in Japan between 1963 - 1966 and was shown on Melbourne TV in April 1966 at
5.30pm Sunday's on channel 0.The tv week described it as &quot;Cartoon adventure series
about a youngster in the 21st century.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
<i>In Brazil, Astroboy was called "Marte, o Menino Biônico&quot;-Mars, the Bionic
Boy("Sergio Martorelli&quot; &lt;smartt@uol.com.br&gt; ).<br>
</i>It was the first animated TV series to be
produced in Japan and after becoming a worldwide hit, Japanese cartoons began to flood the
market with the release of other successful series' such as Gigantor, 8<sup>th</sup> man
and Prince Planet. The large oval eyes became the standard for most other Japanese
cartoons. 193 episodes were produced, but only 104 of them were redubbed and shown on TV
outside Japan. <br>
The voice of Astroboy and Astrogirl was Billie Lou Watt (died 2001, married to
and survived by Hal Studer who also was part of the dubbing cast on Kimba).&nbsp;
Billie was a female, not a male as
many people believe. She later went on to be Kimba and Jimmy Sparks from Gigantor. The
voice of Dr Elefun was Cliff Owen who also played Inspector Blooper from Gigantor and
Dan&#146;l Baboon from Kimba. Gilbert Mack was the voice of Mr Pompos as well as Dick
Strong from Gigantor and Pauley Cracker from Kimba. <br>
Peter Fernandez wrote more than half of the English scripts and many others were written
by the voice cast members. Peter was paid $100 to $125 per episode - the same fee that he
was later paid by Fred Ladd for Gigantor.<br>
Fred Ladd directed the English version and wrote some of the scripts.&nbsp; Ladd &nbsp;
said that&nbsp; <em>&quot;Astro Boy began with Mushi's #1, and generally stayed in Mushi's
sequence, but we had to reject 6 of their shows, for various reasons: one dealt with
vivisection (unacceptable here as kids' content at the time); one dealt with a bachelor
who had pictures of nude women hanging on his walls; one ('Christ's Eyeballs') dealt with
a criminal hiding out in a church and scratching a secret message to his cohorts on the
eyeballs of a statuette of Christ, (in Buddhist Japan, nobody at the studio
objected).&quot;</em><br>
<br>
In 1982 a coloured version was released and shown in Melbourne throughout the 80&#146;s.
In 1996 it was shown here on cable TV. Many of these episodes are available on video in
Pal format through Siren Entertainment and are still enjoyed by young children today.<br>
The series begins with the death of Dr Boynton&#146;s (a robotics engineer) son Aster
(Toby in the new series) in a car accident set in the year 2000 <em>(help with some
character names from Dave Sternberg)</em>. He makes a robot in his son&#146;s image, but
disappointed that he&#146;s not a real boy he <img src="Astroboy2.gif" align="right" hspace="2" vspace="2" width="168" height="251">disowns him, and he is sold to a robot
circus and here is named Astroboy. The ringmaster Cachatore (Hamegg in the new series)
treats him cruelly, but he is later rescued by Dr Elefun (large nose and two puffs of hair
on the sides of his head) who is against slavery of robots. Under his guidance, Astroboy
embarks on adventures, fighting anything that threatens mankind. Astroboy can fly using
jet rocket propulsion; has weapons including a lazer and machine gun, and has emotions.<br>
Astroboy, like most of the other robots, lives by the robot law that orders robots to help
mankind by doing what&#146;s good. <br>
Other characters in the series included Mr Pompous who was a friend of Dr Elefun&#146;s
(renamed Daddy Walrus in the coloured series because of his long moustache), Astrogirl
(named Uran in the colour series) made by Dr Elefun as Astroboy&#146;s sister.
Astroboy&#146;s bigger brother was named Jetto. He was stored away in the warehouse of the
Science Academy and was created by Dr. Boynton as a prototype of Astroboy.<br>
One of Astroboy&#146;s main enemies is Atlas who was a boy robot but was rebuilt into a
highly intelligent and powerful robot.<br>
Daddy Walrus is sometimes a secret agent and in some episodes is also Judo Expert (as this
fact is demonstrated in the Blackie Young episode). He retains the boastful loudmouth
qualities of Mr. Pompous but actually is portayed in the new series as a courageous
individual as opposed to a<br>
cowardly braggard in the older Astroboy series.&nbsp; <br>
The Dr. Elefant character in the New Astroboy is a somewhat less of a scholar and actually
more of a foolish &quot;Absent Minded professor&quot;, rather than the learned man that we
see heading up &quot;The Institute of Science&quot;.&nbsp; (Info on Daddy Walrus from Dave
Sternberg)<br>
<br>
Some of the episodes include &#145;Funnel To The Future&quot; where Astroboy, Astrogirl
and Dr Elefun are sent 70 000 years into the future; &#145;Mystery Of The Metal Men&#146;
where Astroboy is blown away into a parallel world and &#145;Gangor The Monster&#146;
where 46 wrestling robots join together to form a giant centipede. The Lost Episode titled
&#145;The Beast from 20 Fathoms&#146; was created in 1963. 2 copies were made . The
Japanese version was destroyed as Osamu Tezuka was unhappy with it. The other copy was
sent to America for dubbing and is the only version that exists today.<img src="astro.gif" align="right" hspace="2" vspace="2" width="327" height="227"></p>

<p>The following information is written by Mark Cannon from Canberra Australia who has
picked up some interesting points after watching Astroboy episodes again after nearly 30
years.<br>
<br>
<em>&quot;Amazing the detail you aren't aware of as a kid; for example, though I saw
&quot;Funnel To The Future&quot; several times in my youth, it was only this time that I
recognised the similarilies to HG Wells' &quot;The Time Machine&quot;; mankind vanished,
a huge museum / mausoleum to man, two divergent, diametrically opposed races in the plant
people and the animal people (echoing the Eloi and the Morlocks) and, closest of all Astro
Boy befriending a plant person by pulling her from the river, in which she was drowning
while her fellows looked on apathetically - just as Wells' Time Traveller rescued Weena
the Eloi in identical circumstances. Very cleverly done.<br>
<br>
In &quot;Invasion Of The Metal Men&quot;, I had forgotten that it utilised the concept of
parallel universes; a complicated concept for children to grasp (and we didn't have
&quot;Sliders&quot; to demonstrate it every week!) but it explained the concept in a
wonderfully simple way by comparing it to &quot;Two sides of a single sheet of
paper&quot;.</em></p>

<p><em>In the episode &quot;Mission to the Middle of the World&quot;, Astroboy, Astrogirl
and the journalist travelling with them come across an underground race, descended
survivors of Atlantis, who appear to call themselves &quot;deros&quot;. This got my memory
working, and I did a little research.<br>
Back in the mid-1940s, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, the pulp SF magazine (the very first,
dating form 1926, and about to be revived after a few years of non-publication) published
a lot of stories by a guy called Richard S Shaver. They weren't very well written, but
they got a lot of attention - and generated a lot of controversy in the SF community -
because Shaver claimed that they were all based on truth! He claimed that degenerate
races, living inside the earth, and called &quot;deros&quot; were controlling the
direction of mankind on the surface. These races were using technology left behind by
ancient races like the &quot;Atlans&quot;. <br>
As I said Shaver claimed that all of this was true! He seems to have genuinely believed
it, and today would proabably be writing UFO cult-type books (and probably making a
fortune in the process!). Although his stuff boosted the sales of Amazing Stories for a
while (Although Shaver was a real person, many theorised that most of the stories were
actually written by Amazing's editor, Raymond Palmer), the fans decried it as being
hogwash, and it lead to great controversy. Eventually publication of this &quot;Shaver
Mystery&quot; material, as it came to be known, was dropped, and the whole matter became a
footnote in the history of science fiction. Until, of course, I saw this episode, with its
reference to subterranean &quot;deros&quot;. It seems hard to believe that it was a
cooincidence; perhaps one of the people writing the English language scripts had read
Shaver material as a youth, and decided to put the reference in as an in-joke? We'll never
know, but I thought it an interesting little quirk.<br>
<br>
I also took a quick look at the live action Astroboy film. Well! Could this actually be
the Japanese equivalent of &quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space&quot;? Perhaps somewhere in
Japan, there's a former child actor who looks back on this movie as the crowning
achievement of his career. Mind you, that outfit he had to wear surely qualifies as some
sort of child abuse! And what about those villains with the top hats and big
&quot;Z&quot;s on their front?! Amazing - truely amazing! I wonder what poor old Tezuka
thought of it?&quot;</em>(Mark Cannon)<br>

<p>LATEST INFORMATION ON ASTROBOY&nbsp;<br>
( supplied by Eric U)<br>
1.     Astro Boy was born on April 7, 2003.  There was a big celebration in Japan and a<br>
      little one in Japan town in Downtown Los Angeles.  The Japanese American Cultural<br>
      Museum was running a display, till June 1 2003, of post-war anime featuring many of      Osamu Tezuka's art work and toys.<br>
      2.     Sony is airing a brand new Astro Boy anime series on TV in Japan starting
April 2003.&nbsp; The site with the trailer is <br>
<a href="http://www.b-bat.tv/wakwak/astroboy/">http://www.b-bat.tv/wakwak/astroboy/</a>  It may be choppy at      times depending on how busy that site is.  But if you are lucky to watch the whole clip      smoothly, you will be delighted.  The rendering is great.  And, best of all, there is an      English version of the clip that you can watch.  I would think that they intend to air it      outside Japan also.&nbsp;<br>
      3.     The Black and White version of the Astro Boy series are available for sale in
Japan on DVD.&nbsp; Each set      contains 6 discs of about 36 episodes.&nbsp; Unfortunately
      they are all in Japanese without subtitles.&nbsp;
