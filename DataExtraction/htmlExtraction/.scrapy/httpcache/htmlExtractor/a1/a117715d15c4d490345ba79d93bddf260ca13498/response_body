<H2>VARIATIONS Prototype: Online Musical Scores</H2>
<P>The following selections lead to experimental prototypes of the ways in 
which musical scores and recording liner notes might be used in conjunction
with sound recordings available online through VARIATIONS.  We encourage
interested users to send comments on usability to <a href="http://www.music.indiana.edu/variations/comment.html">varia@dlib.indiana.edu</A> to help us in our ongoing
development of the project.

<P>Due to the early developmental status of this phase of VARIATIONS, we
will not be able to guarantee continued availability of this resource or any
of its components.  We value comments for their help in future development,
but will not necessarily be able to make changes to the prototype
interfaces at this time.
