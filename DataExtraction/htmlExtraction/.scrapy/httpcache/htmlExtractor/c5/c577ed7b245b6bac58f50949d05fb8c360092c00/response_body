DERBY, Conn. --  Let&#146;s face it, P.J. O&#146;Rourke has one of the better gigs on the planet.
 As the official Funniest Republican Alive (OK, so there isn&#146;t much competition besides
 Rush Limbaugh) P.J. gets paid to lampoon or pontificate on just about everything these
days.
<p>
Yes, life and Republicanism have been good to P.J., and he appreciates it. So much,
in fact, that the author of  the deservedly best-selling  &quot;Parliament of Whores&quot; and
 &quot;All the Trouble in the World&quot; has gifted us with 25 years worth of his scribbling.
 &quot;Age and Guile&quot; is the definitive O&#146;Rourke, taking us from his not-so-bright college
 years as a long-haired, pot-smoking picture of callow youth and rage to his pinstriped,
 cigar-sniffing present as the only Republican capable of matching wits with Molly Ivins.
<p>
Unfortunately, Peej (my apologies, old boy, if the endearment enrages you) couldn&#146;t
 write worth spit for at least the first half of those 25 years, and didn&#146;t get really good
 at it until he was well into his 30s and had become, more or less, a Republican. From
 a practical standpoint, it was a good thing he grew up and developed a point of view
 &#150; there isn&#146;t much of a market these days for fuzzy essays on dialectical socialism.
<p>
But you have to wonder, flipping through best-forgotten efforts such as &quot;Jets and Sharks
 Drop Acid, Read Marcuse&quot; from  the &quot;Underground&quot; Press years (1970-1972) why P.J.
let the Atlantic Monthly people dredge this dreck up.
<p>
Engagingly as ever, he &#145;fesses up right away: it was the money, and he enjoys getting
paid twice for doing stuff. &quot;The business of trading embarrassment for money is an old
American custom, dating back to the murky beginnings of the Phil Donahue show,&quot; he
writes. &quot;Examining these works, I see evidence that I was once younger than anyone
has ever been. And on drugs.&quot;
<p>
So &quot;Age and Guile&quot; will not deliver the same laugh value per page per dollar as some
 of Peej&#146;s recent work, if you&#146;re the sort of person who calculates such things.
 One has to be interested in his evolution as a writer in order to wade through the
 stuff from the &#145;70s at all. Conservative fans will point out smugly that their boy couldn&#146;t
 write at all as a liberal and his star has ascended only since he saw the light; liberals
 might argue that O&#146;Rourke is just as shallow now as he was then, but better dressed
 and coifed. Regardless, P.J. on drugs in the &#145;70s is boring in the &#145;90s, and one wonders
 how the hell he ever got to be executive editor at the National Lampoon.
<p>
A lot of people at the National Lampoon apparently wondered that back then, too.
 Tony Hendra, a Lampoon managing editor in the &#145;70s, remembered O&#146;Rourke
 rather viscerally in &quot;Going Too Far,&quot; a 1988 book about the recent history of
 counterculture humor. Though Hendra praised O&#146;Rourke for his enthusiasm and capacity
 for work (solid Republican virtues, those) he was unkind, to put it charitably,
 when analyzing the quality of Peej&#146;s satire:
<p>
&quot;Left to himself, he lurched between imitation of other style and invective. It was like
 overfertilized fruit that looked right, felt right, but when you bit into it, just didn&#146;t taste
 of anything.&quot;
<p>
Much of what Hendra didn&#146;t think was funny then isn&#146;t funny now, though 
&quot;The Problem with Communism,&quot; a Lampoon editorial from 1979 that pops up about
 a third of the way through &quot;Age and Guile,&quot; gives a hint of the P.J.-to-come.
 The book gets better from there, but the reader should be forewarned: O&#146;Rourke&#146;s
 best stuff has already been collected, bound and sold, and much of what is here,
 even the laugh-out-loud knee-slappers, didn&#146;t make the first cut.
<p>
What emerges in several pieces is a somewhat darker, not-so-funny, misogynistic
 O&#146;Rourke with a mean streak wider than one of Limbaugh&#146;s ties. On women:
 &quot;Why don&#146;t we fall for dogs? They have ten tits. Small ones, true, but think of it &#150; ten!&quot;
 I could forgive him a one-liner, but that was the overall tenor and quality of an entire
 essay for Esquire. As to the mean streak, &quot;100 Reasons Why Jimmy Carter Was a
 Better President Than Bill Clinton,&quot; originally written for The American Spectator,
 is full of cheap shots that read as though Peej cribbed the whole thing from
 a couple of weeks worth of postings on Usenet&#146;s alt.usa.republican.

The best of the later stuff is vintage O&#146;Rourke: Explaining to Generation X&#146;ers why
 Republicanism is Good, threatening to shoot those who would bring back the &#145;60s,
 a look at Whitewater from the Arkansas point of view, essays on good Republican
 activities like flyfishing and golf. But the most enlightening riff, for me, was not
 a &quot;print&quot; piece at all, but the text of a speech P.J. gave to the Cato Institute.
<p>
 You see, Peej isn&#146;t so much a Republican as he is a Libertarian: &quot;Government
 should be against the law,&quot; he explains, and we&#146;ll just have to see if a simple premise
 like that will provide him with 25 more years of being pretty funny.
<p>
Or if he&#146;ll turn into George Will.
