----------
Dave Who?
----------
No, not Dave Who, Dave _Barry_.  Dave Barry is a syndicated columnist
whose humorous articles appear in hundreds of newspapers every week.
When he's not writing his columns for the enjoyment of the world, he
writes for the Miami Herald's Tropic Magazine.  Dave has won a Pulitzer
Prize for his humor columns (for several of his columns in the category
of Distinguished Social Commentary in 1988) and is the lead guitarist
in a rock band called the _Rock Bottom Remainders_.  Plus, Dave is 
an all-around nice guy who tries to protect his readers from the dangers 
f the world around them, like exploding cows and trout falling from the 
ky.  This newsgroup is *not* about David Barry, the auto writer for Vogue 
agazine.


-----------
Where Can I Read Dave's Articles?
-----------
Well, if you want to get your weekly dose of Dave in your local newspaper,
check out the list at the end of the FAQ.  It contains the names of 
hundreds of newspapers and magazines across the United States and around 
the world that carry Dave Barry's articles on a regular basis.  For those 
of you who are too lazy to get up from your computers, keep reading...

(DISCLAIMER: This is not an advertisement or endorsement of any service,
newspaper, or magazine mentioned, but is intended merely as a response to 
one of the most frequently asked question in the newsgroup, 
alt.fan.dave_barry.)


------------
How Can I Get Dave's Columns Electronically?
------------
Dave Barry is a Professional Writer.  His job is (I'm not making this up...)
to sit around playing flight simulation games until a thought hits him
(usually just before deadline), write it down, then send it in to his
editor.  His articles are not in the public domain.  Remember, it is a
violation of copyright laws to reproduce Dave's column, so don't even think
about typing one in and posting it.

                            Miami Herald
                            ------------
You can now read Dave's weekly column through The Miami Herald's web
site, HERALDLink.  The address is <a href=http://www.herald.com/>http://www.herald.com/</a> .  Go to the
"Voices" section in the menu along the left and then click on Dave's
smiling face.

                            Denver Post
                            -----------
The Denver Post's On-Line Newspaper at <a href=http://www.denverpost.com/>http://www.denverpost.com/</a>
also has Dave's weekly column.  Go to the "Empire Magazine" section
and then click on "Dave Barry" along the right hand column.  This one
also includes the Jeff MacNelly cartoon.

                        San Jose Mercury News
                        ---------------------
If you're a subscriber to the San Jose Mercury News's "Mercury Center
Web" service, you can read Dave's latest column, plus browse through
a library of his older columns on their WWW page.  

The Mercury News has also started a service called NewsHound, through
which you can get Dave's column e-mailed to you (it's a bit expensive,
but you can get other things in addition to Dave's column).  For more
information on the Mercury Center Web service, check out
<a href=http://www.sjmercury.com/main.htm>http://www.sjmercury.com/main.htm</a> and select "About our Service".  For
information about the NewsHound service, check out
<a href=http://www.sjmercury.com/hound.htm>http://www.sjmercury.com/hound.htm</a> .  Or, for information by phone
about any San Jose Mercury News service, call 1-800-818-NEWS.


-----------
Is there a Dave Barry WWW page?
-----------

There are several pages to my knowledge

	<a href=http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~msteele/dbarry/>http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~msteele/dbarry/</a>

  inside jokes for the newcomers)

	<a href=http://www.dqydj.com/rbr.htm>http://www.dqydj.com/rbr.htm</a>
* Jon Grimes has a Dave Barry page at

	<a href=http://www.wam.umd.edu/~meercat/Dave_Barry_96.html>http://www.wam.umd.edu/~meercat/Dave_Barry_96.html</a>

There are also many web sites with articles and essays about Dave
Barry and reviews of his books, listed under the "Articles About Dave"
section below.

-----------
Is there a mailing list version of this newsgroup?
-----------
Nope.


-----------
How can I Write to Dave?
-----------
To write to Dave Barry (and get your very own postcard reply from "The
Man" himself), write to:

	Dave Barry
	c/o Tropic Magazine
	Miami Herald
	1 Herald Plaza
	Miami, FL  33132


-------------
Does Dave read this newsgroup?
-------------
He used to, but no longer finds the time to keep up with all the
messages.


-------------
Can I send E-Mail to Dave?
-------------
Yup.


-------------
Well?  Aren't you going to tell me his address?
-------------
If you had millions of fans who all wanted to have frequent, personal,
e-mail conversations with you, you'd probably feel flattered for the
first 5 minutes, and then spend the rest of your life regretting that
you told anyone your e-mail address.

Dave doesn't want his address in the FAQ, for pretty much the above
reason.  Plus, he says he gets too much regular paper-mail to keep up
with, let alone trying to manage fan e-mail too.  Please do not write
to me asking for Dave's address or mail me things to forward to Dave
for you... such requests will be ignored.  Print it out and mail it
yourself (the exercise you'll get walking to the mailbox is good for you).


-------------
Tell me all the juicy gossip about Dave!
-------------
You can find this information in those magazines next to the checkout
in the supermarket.  Yeah, Dave divorced and remarried (to fellow writer
Michelle "MSPtato" Kaufmann) in 1996.  Let's get on with our lives.


-------------
Is there a non-Internet Dave Barry Fan Club?
-------------
Why, yes there is...  The Dave Barry Fan Club puts out a newsletter 
three times a year entitled "We're Not Making This Up" which features
info about Dave and personal letters from him (he fills out a questionairre
for each issue).  To recieve the newsletter (through regular mail,
not e-mail) send $6 ($4.50 for members of Mensa) for a year (or $1 for
a 1 issue sample) to:
	Rocky Lefarth
	PO Box 510523
	St. Louis, MO  63151

This section used to say, "Contact Barbara Ploegstra
(bploegst@smtpgwy.ssmhc.com) for more information," but I've been told
that her e-mail address is no longer working.  You can try sending her
mail anyway if you like.


-------------
What's this about a Dave Barry TV show?
-------------
[Thanks to "Alert Viewers" ;-) Brett Doehr (doehr@den.mmc.com) and
Laura Troise (troislaa@barnard.columbia.edu) for most of this information]

The show is called "Dave's World", and it is on a local CBS affiliate
near you at 8:00pm (7:00 Central &amp; Mountain) Wednesday nights.  The show
is based on the books "Dave Barry Turns 40" and "Dave Barry's Greatest
Hits".  In the show, Dave has 2 kids and one dog (as opposed to 1 kid
and 2 dogs in real life (Zippy got cut)) and Dave works for the
_Miami_Record_Dispatch_ Sunday Magazine Section (instead of the
_Miami_Herald_ "Tropic" Magazine).  The real Dave Barry has appeared
in one episode in the first season of the series, in which he played
a guy who gets into a bidding war with the Barry's to purchase an air
conditioner.  The real Dave and the fake Dave (Harry Anderson)
played/sang "Wild Thing" during the closing credits.

Cast:
	Dave Barry -- Harry Anderson
	Beth Barry (Dave's Wife) -- DeLane Matthews
	Ken Becket (Dave's Boss) -- Shadoe Stevens
	Mia (Dave's Secretary) -- J.C. Wendel
	Eric (Mia's Boyfriend) -- Patrick Warburton
	Tommy Barry (Dave's older son) -- Zane Carney
	Willie Barry (Dave's younger son) -- Andrew Ducote
	Shel Baylor (Dave's Friend) -- Meshach Taylor
Occasional Guests:
	Julie (Beth's Sister) -- Tammy Lauren
	Eric Jr. (Eric's dad) -- Eugene Roche
And, so you know who to direct your complaints about the annoying
laugh track to...
	Created By -- Fred Barron
	Production -- The Producers Entertainment Group Ltd., Livestock
                      Productions, and Axelrod/Widdoes Productions, in
                      association with CBS Productions
	Executive Producers -- Jonathon Axelrod, Tim O'Donnell, James Widdoes
	Produced By -- Michael Petok
	Creative Consultants -- Nick LeRose, Tom Reeder


-------------
Recently, Dave had a "Worst Song" Contest.  What did he pick as the worst
Rock and Roll Song of All Time?
-------------
"MacArthur Park", written by Jim Webb, performed by Richard Harris in 1968
and later in 1978 by Donna Summer.


-------------
On the Topic of Bad Music, What's That Band that Dave's In?
-------------
Dave is the lead guitarist for the rock band, The Rock Bottom Remainders.
The group includes such popular writers as Dave Barry (lead guitar,vocals), 
Stephen King (rhythm guitar,vocals), Ridley Pearson (bass guitar), Amy Tan 
(vocals), Barbara Kingsolver (keyboards), Robert Fulghum (backup vocals), 
Roy Blount Jr. (backup vocals), Dave Marsh (backup vocals), Tad Bartimus 
(backups vocals), and organizer Kathi Goldmark (backup vocals).  The group 
was put together by Goldmark at a writers convention in 1991.  They named 
the band after the bookstore practice of selling last year's bestsellers at 
bargain rates.  Music veteren Al Kooper is the band's musical director and 
plays keyboards and guitar with the band.  The group went on its first tour 
in May, 1993, with the proceeds going to the Right to Rock Network and a 
variety of literacy and First Amendment organizations.  Their motto is, "We 
play music as well as Metallica writes novels."

A book about the Rock Bottom Remainders has been published, entitled
"Mid-Life Confidential: The Rock Bottom Remainders Tour America with
Three Chords and an Attitude" (see "Other Stuff" section under "What
Books Has Dave Written" below for more info).  Check out the Rock 
Bottom Remainders' web page at "<a href=http://www.dqydj.com/rbr.htm>http://www.dqydj.com/rbr.htm</a>" for more 
detailed information.


-------------
Will the Rock Bottom Remainders be playing in my town soon?
-------------
Doubtful.  Our music industry inside sources tell us that, much to the
relief of music-lovers everywhere, the band has disbanded.


-------------
What is Tropic Hunt?
-------------
Tropic Hunt is a combination scavenger hunt and brain puzzle held in
the Miami area which is hosted by the Miami Herald's Tropic Magazine.
It will be held in November this year.  Dave is one of the Hunt's
creators and he helps organize it.  Asides from that, it's hard to
explain.  More information on Tropic Hunt can be found on the American
Treasure Hunt Society's web page at,
         <a href=http://www.treasurehunt.org/info/tropic.htm>http://www.treasurehunt.org/info/tropic.htm</a>

--------------

--------------
[Thanks to "Alert Librarian" Barbara Huff-Duff of Caltech, Pasadena, CA,

most people will ever need...  :-)  ]

What other Dave Barry Paraphernalia Can I Purchase?
