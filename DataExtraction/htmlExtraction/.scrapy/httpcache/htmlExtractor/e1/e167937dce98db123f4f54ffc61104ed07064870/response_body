<blockquote>"And long it was not after, when I was confirmed in this opinion,
that he who would not be frustrate of his hope to write well hereafter
in laudable things, ought himself to be a true poem, that is, a composition
and pattern of the best and honourablest things; not presuming to sing
high praises of heroic men or famous cities unless he have in himself the
experience and practice of all that which is praiseworthy."
<div align=right>An Apology for Smectymnuus, 1642</div>
</blockquote>
We can presume John Milton, born 1608, believed what he wrote. This goes
for both <i>Paradise Lost</i> and the political article above. He certainly
made every effort to live up to it, on his own terms.
<p>Milton lived and acted in a time of crises, the civil war where England
went to the brink France came to in 1789, and then came <i>back</i>, when
no one, least of all their movers and shakers, dreamt it possible. The
English civil war didn't even change the dynasty. It was a matter in which
political concerns were irredeemably tied up with religious, and Milton
makes an excellent 'abstract and brief chronicle of the time'.
<p>Milton was a Puritan, which at this point can be considered a left-wing
Protestant. The present-day reputation of Puritans just goes to show what
isolation and physical hardship will do to anyone: those were the American
Puritans, who had left England in 1619. In England, these 'believers in
purity' were among the foremost of intellectuals and radicals -- to be expected
in a country in which the overall power of Catholicism had been broken.
It was the attempt of Charles I to impose some order on a turbulent and
ever-expanding range of experimental sects, and especially to unite the
churches in Scotland with those of England, that brought things to open
war. If there was one thing that could band such a variety of groups together,
it was the spectre of the return of Catholicism, which is how many interpreted
his action. The other thing was a brilliant leader; this was Oliver Cromwell,
and the English Reformation did not outlast either of these inspirations.
<p>Milton was the son of a prosperous scrivener -- part scribe, part justice
of the peace -- and what was considered a gentleman. He was educated at
Christ's College, Cambridge, and there seems to have been a general idea
he was to take holy orders. He received a classical education, to the confusion
of his more modern readers who may find themselves floundering amongst
the allusions to Greek myths -- my advice, I'm afraid, is go and read them.
You'll find most of the Romantic poets make a deal more sense too -- <i>and</i>
after you've read Milton. Milton saw himself, and from an early age, as
a poet, who aimed to prove the English language as fit a vehicle for heroism
as Greek or Latin. In another political pamphlet, also of 1642, he found
the space to write of;
<blockquote>an inward prompting which now grew daily upon me, that by labour
and intent study (which I take to be my portion in this life) joined with
the strong propensity of nature, I might perhaps leave something so written
to aftertimes, as they should not willingly let it die.</blockquote>
It could be extrapolated, he also aimed to make the central Christian myth
as fit a subject for poetry as any Greek or Latin fable. In these years,
he did publish some poems such as <i>Lycidas</i>, an elegy in the accepted
classical form on a drowned friend, and a masque, <i>Comus</i>, contrasting
the rewards of Christian temperance and Pagan lasciviousness. After receiving
his MA in 1632, he travelled in France, Italy and Switzerland, returning
to England when news reached him of the escalating turmoil.
<p>In the lead-up to the war, the increasingly demanding parliament caused
the abolition of the 'Star Chamber' in 1641. This body was, of long standing,
a high court of justice responsible only to the crown, and one of it's
responsibilities was censorship of the press. Books had to be approved
by a government licensee before printing, by a licensed printer. This fitted
in with the printers guild's (Guild of Stationers) idea of healthy competition
very nicely. It was when this system broke down that we first hear of John
Milton, the pamphleteer. <i>An Apology for Smectymnuus</i> was written
in support of an anti-hierarchical church pamphlet produced by one of his
old tutors.
<p>Pamphleteering was the main way of disseminating opinions. It held it's
own dangers under the administration; in 1637 another Puritan pamphleteer
named William Prynne had had the <i>remainder</i> of his ears cut off for
distributing seditious writings -- it was his second offence. The worst
Milton encountered however, whilst the reformation was on, was notoriety.
He was hard put to shake the nickname 'Milton the Divorcer' after his publication,
<i>The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce</i> in 1643. He was separated
from his wife at the time. Milton's political pamphlets are interesting
in that they are all very personal, in one way or another. They are all
idealistic, all related to ideas of a reformed and just new society, that
must needs start with the demolishment of the Church hierarchy and the
monarchy. His role, as in the above quote from <i>Reason of Church Government
Urged</i>, is the poet of the State. In a way, he achieved this.
<p>In 1644, the revolutionary parliament brought <i>back</i> the mechanism
of censorship, inevitably for the same reasons the King had maintained
it. Milton published <i>Of Education</i> and<i> Areopagitica</i>, illegally
in Amsterdam, the latter being a defence of the free press. Parliament
responded, eventually, by offering him a position of Secretary for the
Foreign Tongues and politely requesting, in effect, that he write propaganda
justifying their regicide. Milton accepted. The results were <i>Eikonklastes</i>
and<i> Pro Populario Defensio</i> -- 'a defence of the people of England'.
He was replaced of necessity in his secretarial duties in 1655, but continued
active in what was, after all, his vocation as a reformer. In 1655, he
lost the last of his eyesight, which had been deteriorating for some time.
<p>In 1660, after the death of Cromwell (from natural causes, believe it
or not), the parliament accepted concessions from Charles's son, who had
spent the last decade in France. Charles II was crowned that same year.
The movement back to monarchism had been tending for some time, and it
can only be seen as an act of genuine belief in his cause; a last gesture
of faith, perhaps; that Milton published <i>A Ready and Easy Way to Establish
a Free Commonwealth</i> this year, under his own name. It must be said,
this was the equivalent of standing up during hunting season with a pair
of antlers on your hat.
<p>As it happened, he brazened through. His <i>Eikonklastes</i> and <i>Pro
Populio Defensio</i> were banned, and all copies theoretically called in
and publicly burnt. But Milton had his following as a writer, and someone,
friend or foe, came up with the statement he had already been punished
by God with his blindness. He received a full pardon, and went back to
his inherited estate and to a project, it seems, had already been partially
begun.
<p>This is the background to one of the most extraordinary pieces of literature
to come out of the Christian thesis.
<blockquote>Of Man's First disobedience, and the Fruit
<br>Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal taste
<br>Brought Death into the world, and all our woe,
<br>*
<br>What in me is dark
<br>Illumine, what is low raise and support;
<br>That to the height of this great Argument
<br>I may assert Eternal Providence,
<br>And justify the ways of God to men.</blockquote>
That Milton never did take holy orders is no real mystery. He didn't want
a canon, he wanted an argument. And that is what <i>Paradise Lost</i> is,
a series of arguments. The brilliant movement, imagery and scope; that
can hypnotise an atheist and set Christian critics at loggerheads; is all
part of the grand debate, in which several voices argue their points and
logic finally reveals the truth. This is a classicist, who has read Plato
and Cicero, and is here achieving perfectly the great Renaissance trick
of mating Christian belief with essentially Pagan science.
<p>The several voices are, of course, God, Mankind and 'th' Arch-Enemy,
And thence in Heav'n call'd Satan'. It was certainly not unknown or as
a rule unacceptable, for all the different elements of the Christian myth
to be portrayed and speak; consider the Mystery plays of the proper Middle
Ages. It was not even unknown to create them as characters -- consider Christopher
Marlowe's <i>Faustus</i>. Milton created them, however, as characters in
an heroic epic, which provides one of the few feasible models for <i>good</i>
characters. To give him and the achievement credit, Milton is one of the
few authors that have ever managed personalties for angels.
<p>But Milton gives personalities to demons that more than match them.
If this is a heroic epic, then the Fallen Angels are the dragon, the villain,
who always does provide the story. But how is it, in an overtly Christian
and moralising tale, that a careful and idealistic writer gives us one
of the most powerful and attractive visions of evil ever produced? And
not only that, the most <i>logical</i>.
<blockquote>This knows my punisher; therefore as far
<br>From granting hee, as I from begging peace:
<br>All hope excluded thus, behold instead
<br>Of us out-cast, exil'd, his new delight,
<br>Mankind created, and for him this World.
<br>So farewell Hope, and with Hope farewell Fear,
<br>Farewell Remorse: all Good to me is lost;
<br>Evil be thou my Good.</blockquote>
Satan's position from the bible onward has been special; there always seems
to have been a hierarchy of angels, and Satan was of the highest rank.
Milton was attempting to reason how an 'angelic intelligence' could willingly
defy God. Satan's logic, in Milton's grand scheme, must needs be consistent
and expressed with all power, but be given the lie by the logic of God.
It is perhaps an indication of Milton's disapproval, of certain ways of
thinking, that many readers then and now have found the opposite to occur.
The artist William Blake, who worked in the eighteenth century and produced
the most adequate illustrations of <i>Paradise</i>, (also of Dante's <i>Inferno</i>,
and the biblical <i>Book of Job</i>) considered;
<blockquote>The reason Milton wrote in fetters when he wrote of Angels
and God, and at liberty when of Devils and Hell, is because he was a true
Poet and of the Devil's party without knowing it.
<div align=right><i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. </i>1793</div>
</blockquote>
Grant at least, that Milton created a <i>political</i> heaven and hell,
as he was most qualified to do.
<p><i>Paradise Lost </i>was published in 1667, twelve 'books' 'freed of
the troublesome and modern bondage to rhyme'. It was moderately well received.
Milton published two more works before his death in 1674, <i>Paradise Regained</i>
and <i>Sampson Agonistes</i>, a poem and a play, in 1671. <i>Paradise Regained</i>
was said by Milton in the preface to be the result of a friend's vastly
predictable joke. It deals with the temptation of Christ by Satan, who
makes his return in excellent form.<i> Sampson Agonistes </i>deals with
the legend of Sampson and Delilah. Sixty years after, the manuscript of
<i>A Christian Doctrine</i> was discovered in a cupboard at the house of
one of his friends, together with strict instructions for the friend to
publish it after Milton's death. It was his last pamphlet.
