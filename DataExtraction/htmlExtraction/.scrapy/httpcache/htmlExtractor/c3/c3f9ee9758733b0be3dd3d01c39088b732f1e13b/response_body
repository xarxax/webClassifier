	<center>  <i>  We walked troubles brooding wind swept hills<br>  And we loved and we laughed the pain away<br>  At the end of the journey, when our last song is sung<br>  Will you meet me in Heaven someday<br>  </i>  </center>  <p>    <P>
The Man In Black...has finally faded to black. Years after he has flirted with death back and forth, he     <P>
has finally taken the trip to the other side. Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins and now Johnny have     <P>
all left us. Only Jerry Lee Lewis is left from that original group of Sun Studio musicians. These men     <P>
revolutionized rock music, as we know it today. What differentiated Cash from the others is that he was so     <P>
deeply rooted in all forms of music...country, gospel, rock, and folk. All of them dabbled in other types     <P>
of music, especially Elvis, but none were as expansive as Cash. After his wife's death this past May, Cash     <P>
and producer Rick Rubin apparently laid down basic tracks for close to thirty songs over the course of the     <P>
summer. Also, later this year, a box set of outtakes from all four "American Recordings" albums will     <P>
surface, "Unearthed". I can't think of a single release this fall I am looking more forward to. The loss     <P>
of Johnny Cash is as significant as the loss of Lennon, Presley, Hendrix, Moon, Hank Williams...however,     <P>
unlike his contemporaries, we were fortunate enough to have enjoyed the man and his music longer than any     <P>
of the other artists I mentioned. Cash continued to grace millions with the gift of new music, and not     <P>
just recycled music, but music that gave me comfort, music I loved, music that still moves to me tears.    <P>
<p>  <center>  <i>  Elvis... Would've been a sissy without Johnny Cash<br>  -U2, "Elvis Ate America"  </center>  </i>  <p>    <P>
Now, I am not going to pretend that my love for Johnny Cash goes back to my childhood or tell you about a     <P>
close encounter I had with the man. The truth is, I became a casual fan about a decade ago and become     <P>
enamored with his music over the last four years of my life. However, my love for this man and his music     <P>
is deeper than almost all of the music I ever have or ever will listen to. I don't feel that many people     <P>
from my generation realize what an incredible loss this truly is. Ever since I was young, I can always     <P>
remember who he was. However, in the last few years, I have had this man and his music invade my daily     <P>
thoughts and help paint my dreams. My first major exposure to Johnny Cash was when I bought U2's "Zooropa"     <P>
album back in 1993. "Zooropa" is an underrated album and while it may not hold a candle to its sister     <P>
recording, "Achtung Baby", it's still a stunning document and one, which continues to get better with     <P>
time. The album's final track is "The Wanderer". Bono was going to record the vocals when the band got the     <P>
idea for Cash to lay his vocals on the track. To some the track may seem out of place, but ten years down     <P>
the road, it's a fitting and idyllic way to end the album. Upon hearing "The Wanderer" I was astonished at     <P>
the richness of Cash's voice. How can someone who did not write the lyrics sing a song with such emotion     <P>
and conviction? Whenever I heard his voice in the future, I immediately knew it was Cash without fail     <P>
every time.     <P>
<p>    <P>
My deep love affair with the Man In Black occurred in 2000 with my purchase of  "American Recordings III".     <P>
He was doing a number of covers on the album, including "I Won't Back Down" and "One", which prompted me     <P>
to buy the album initially. How he remade these songs and made them his own, I'll never understand. He did     <P>
not write either song, but when you hear his voice, it's as if he has lived through these experiences, his     <P>
voice transcends the songs. The only other act I have ever heard in my lifetime who can consistently     <P>
express such a wide range of emotions on songs he did not write is Frank Sinatra. It's rare someone can     <P>
command a song so convincingly with emotion on music that did not come from within. Somehow, Cash does it.   <p>     <P>
Shortly thereafter, I went out and bought all of the "American Recordings". These are among the finest     <P>
records ever produced in the annals of music-country, rock, folk, any style, period! Producer Rick Rubin     <P>
took Cash under his wing and they decided to reinvent many of Cash's classic tunes and to put a different     <P>
spin on many contemporary tracks.  These recordings are bare naked, stripped to the bone...I love them     <P>
because they expose his soul to me. There is nothing more expressive or pleasing than truly getting inside     <P>
of someone. I'm not talking about the physical needs that so many go to soulless bars on weekends hoping     <P>
to fulfill, but the feeling when someone is exposing themselves to you, with their mind and heart. They     <P>
trust you and break down all walls and let you invade their mind, body and soul. This is the point of     <P>
"American Recordings". Rick Rubin did what no other producer had done with Cash in almost two decades. He     <P>
got to the core and showcased this man's amazing voice. Not only did he reinvent many of his own songs,     <P>
but his takes on standards by Tom Petty, U2, Nick Cave, Tom Waits, Leonard Cohen, Beck, Soundgarden, The     <P>
Beatles, Sting, Depeche Mode and most recently, Nine Inch Nails. He adds a new element to each of these     <P>
tracks. The core is the lyrics. Somehow, Rubin and Cash find a way to make you believe these are Johnny     <P>
Cash originals. The songs on "American Recordings" are among some of the most stirring and poignant songs     <P>
I have heard over the last decade.     <P>
<P>    <P>
Over the course of the last year, more attention has been given to Cash than at any time in the last 25     <P>
years. It is all as a result of the video of his cover of the Nine Inch Nails song, "Hurt". Rubin and Cash     <P>
brought a song, originally intended to be about heroin addiction, to life as it turned into something more     <P>
spiritual. The haunting and surreal video of the song is unlike any other music video ever made -echoing     <P>
his impending death, the last supper imagery, his broken down museum and the look on his late wife's face     <P>
as she looks upon his weary body from the stairway of their home...the same look she probably gave for the     <P>
last four months looking from the heavens above.     <P>
<p>    <P>
Anyone who is not moved by the video of "Hurt" is lying. I truly felt the video medium had been taken as     <P>
far as it could have possibly been taken about a decade back, but I was wrong. "Hurt" may be the greatest     <P>
short clip ever done for the format and the fact that MTV aired the video a total of six times and did not     <P>
give it Video of the Year is something that should prove how far the network has removed itself from     <P>
anything relating to music and the art form of videos. This is more than a video, but a mini movie of     <P>
Cash's life. There are images of him in his youth with him as an older man playing his guitar, pouring     <P>
wine over a feast and watching the man with his hands shake -images all so powerful it nearly brought me     <P>
to near tears each and every time I watched it. Director Mark Romanick did more in four minutes than most     <P>
filmmakers do with 20 two-hour films over the course of an entire career. I never knew such a small piece     <P>
of film could bring out such a wide range of emotions. Every single person who has seen the video has     <P>
mentioned it to me. I can't tell you how many people have watched the video and been completely speechless     <P>
afterwards. My friends Chris and Andy, weeks apart, both looked at me and said "Did you see the video for     <P>
'Hurt'?" Neither said another word, they just stared at me as if they were in awe, moved, disturbed,     <P>
shaken...there was nothing else that could be said. The video said it all.     <P>
<P>    <P>
I will continue to love and relish Johnny Cash through the 400 songs he wrote and 100 albums he released     <P>
in his 71-year life. I will continue to look forward to more new material, which will allow him to speak     <P>
beyond the grave. I will continue to be moved by his spiritual songs, my heart will be made warm by the     <P>
love songs he wrote, and I will be mystified by the songs of cowboys, hustlers and thieves.     <P>
<p>    <P>
<center>  <i>  We've seen the secret things revealed by God<br>  And we heard what the angels had to say<br>  Should you go first, or if you follow me<br>  Will you meet me in Heaven someday<br>  </center>  </i>    <P>
<P>    <P>
Cash was a spiritual man. This is a man whose faith ran so deep that the religious overtones could always     <P>
be found among his music. He believed in his God and his faith but expressed hope in so many of his songs.     <P>
Cash was a man whose faith was unswerving. He believed so deeply that I have no doubt that he is above us,     <P>
looking down, smiling and among an assortment of white cloaks, he is the sole individual dressed in black.     <P>
Who knows, maybe even Elvis Aaron was there to greet him along with his soul mate June. I recently watched     <P>
a Kurt Loder interview with the Cash. Loder asked him where he thought we go when life ends. Cash, sat     <P>
back in his chair, and in most sincere and serene way said, "We all hope to go to heaven".  Me too.     <P>
<p>    <P>
Despite a riotous past, I am positive Johnny has made it to the Promised Land with his soul mate, June. I     <P>
am sure they are walking hand in hand, after a brief separation, looking over their loved ones below. For     <P>
the rest of future generations and us, they will both be in our hearts and minds each and every time we     <P>
hear one of their songs. The entire Carter family clan joined Cash on the final track of his most recent     <P>
"American Recordings", "We'll Meet Again". As I look over the tracks he chose for the fourth installment,     <P>
it's almost as if he had envisioned something would happen. "In My Life", "Bridge Over Troubled Water",     <P>
"The Man Comes Around", "Desperado", "Personal Jesus"...all songs I initially thought added for more     <P>
commercial value seem to have a much deeper meaning now. The songs on "American Recordings #4" hit deep,     <P>
and these feelings rip away the flesh even more so...they represent an artist at his creative peak. The     <P>
album concludes with the standard "We'll Meet Again", I am sure we will all meet up with the Man in Black     <P>
again and if we're lucky, it will be Johnny Cash in the black and not a gatekeeper below.    <P>
<P>    <P>
