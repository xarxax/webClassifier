      <p>(<em> Note: This entry is several years old. Some of the information may be outdated. Two of the founders' children now run most of the operation. Even so, the basic idea hasn't changed. Amway makes a profit on every sale of every product it offers for sale. The sales people are considered independent business owners (IBOs) and they make money on every sale they make and by recruiting others to makes sales of the same products. They spend money  buying Amway products, including the cost of materials and seminars aimed at making them believe that having a positive attitude and working hard are the keys to success. I'll give everyone some free advice: these qualities are usually necessary conditions for success, but they're not sufficient conditions. Anything you can buy from Amway, you can buy elsewhere for the same or less and get something of equal or better quality. Don't forget to check the <a href="#news">latest news on Amway</a>.</em>)</p>
      <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><a href="http://www.amway.com/EN">Amway</a>, a subsidiary of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alticor">Alticor</a>, 
    is the largest multi-level marketing <a HREF="mlm.html">(MLM</a>) organization in
    the world. It is a multi-billion dollar a year company based on the sale of products as
    varied as soap, water purifiers, vitamins, and cosmetics. One of Amway&#39;s 
    most important products is <i>motivation</i>. Selling motivational products 
    at motivational seminars is one of the more lucrative aspects of this 
    enterprise. Amway proponents are fond of
    asserting that their products are of the highest quality, their company is very large
    (several million distributors and several billion dollars in annual sales), and does
    business with such giants as Coca-Cola and MCI (bought by Verizon). </font> </p>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">In Amway, one is recruited as an &quot;independent&quot; distributor of Amway products
    by buying a couple of hundred dollars' worth of the products from the one who recruits you,
    known as your &quot;upline.&quot; Every distributor in turn tries to recruit more
    distributors. Income is generated by sales of products by the distributor plus
    &quot;bonuses&quot; from sales of his or her recruits and their recruit-descendants.</font></p>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Here is a description from an Amway distributor as to how it works.
    </font> </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">It goes like this: </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">If I buy $200 of stuff from Amway this month, I'll get a 3% bonus check (3% of $200
      = $6). If I share the opportunity with nine others, and we each buy $200 of stuff from
      Amway this month, they each were responsible for $200 and will get $6, but I'm responsible
      for $2000, moving me to the 12% level. I get $240. However, I'm responsible for paying the
      bonuses of the people right below me - $54 - so I keep $186. I make more because I did
      more, I found nine people who wanted to buy at a discount and get a bonus for doing it.
      After I reach the 25% bonus level there are other bonuses that kick in, but they're all
      based on the volume of product flow, not on signing people up or having lots of people (Bob
      Queenan, personal correspondence). [April 7, 2004. Gary Elliot Murway 
      writes: Please correct: distributors/IBOs no longer need to pay downline 
      bonuses. Quixtar can pay each IBO directly.]</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3"><a NAME="pyramid"></a>Amway defenders take offense at describing this method of sales
    and recruitment as akin to a <a href="pyramid.html">pyramid or chain letter scheme</a>. It
    is true that MLM as practiced by Amway is not an <em>illegal</em> pyramid scheme. Amway
    has been taken to court for being an illegal pyramid and the courts have ruled that since
    Amway does not charge people either for joining Amway or for the privilege of recruiting
    others as distributors, it is not an illegal pyramid. Illegal pyramids and chain letters
    have no product. Amway has lots of household products: from laundry detergent to vitamins,
    from cosmetics to water filters. Amway is a <em>legal</em> pyramid scheme.
    </font> </p>
    <h2 align="center">the legal pyramid</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are several distinct aspects of MLM schemes that justify calling them legal
    pyramid schemes. One is the aspect of the chain or line of distributors whose income
    depends primarily not on their own sales of Amway products but on sales made by others
    whom they've recruited. The actual practice gets fairly complicated. Here is how Bob
    Queenan, cited above, describes it: </font> </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Now we get into the actual mechanisms. While my product volume is low, it makes
      sense to combine my order with other orders to reduce the paperwork that Amway has to deal
      with. So the way I order from Amway is to call my &quot;upline&quot; and place my order.
      My upline combines my order with others and calls Amway directly. Amway would normally
      ship direct to the upline, and we'd all go over and pick up our products. In my actual
      case, I live too far away from my upline to make that practical, so I order through my
      upline, but get direct shipments from Amway. </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Do I sell to other distributors? No, we all buy direct from Amway.
      </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Do other distributors order their products through me? Yes, I combine the orders and
      send them to Amway. </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Do I get money from my distributors? Yes, for the products they buy. I write a
      combined check to Amway. </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Do I profit if my distributors buy more? Yes, I do -- so do they, but yes, I do.
      </font>      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Is my bonus from their money? It's from the bonus pot, which is filled with money
      saved by not paying middlemen.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Am I missing something here? Haven't the distributors become their own middlemen?
    Aren't the distributors selling to each other? Isn't income mainly generated by recruiting
    new members to the organization? Isn't Amway Corporation the big winner in this scheme?
    </font> </p>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">An Amway customer is not just buying a detergent, but is recruited into being a
    minister of a faith with a complicated bookkeeping scheme. Why not just go to your local
    store and buy soap, you ask? Because the agent is someone you know, or who knows someone
    you know, who's invited you over for coffee to tell you about a great opportunity. Odds
    are good that you'll either buy something out of politeness or a genuine need for soap or
    vitamins, etc. Perhaps you will become an agent yourself. Either way, the agent
    (distributor) who sold you the soap or vitamins makes money. If you become an agent
    (distributor) then part of every sale you make goes to your recruiter. The new recruit is
    drawn into the system not primarily by the attractiveness of selling Amway <i>products</i>
    door to door, but by the opportunity to sell <i>Amway</i> itself to others who, hopefully,
    will do the same. The products seem secondary to the process of recruitment. Yet, the
    distributors will learn to talk about little else than the product and its
    &quot;quality.&quot; What justifies MLM schemes is the high quality of their products.
    What entices the recruit, however, is likely to be the attractiveness of making money from
    others' sales, not the products themselves. </font> </p>
    <h2 align="center">Do the numbers add up?</h2>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">[Note: the data used in the 
    following paragraph is outdated. I am not going to try to keep up with the 
    specific dollar amounts in sales and the number of distributors. The current
    <a href="http://www.quixtar.com/">Amway Global website</a> does not give the 
    numbers needed to determine how much the average distributor makes.
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amway">Wikipedia</a> claims that sales 
    for 2008 were $8.2 billion, up from
    <a href="http://www.amway.co.uk/cms/about_amway_and_direct_selling/who_is_amway">
    $7.1 billion the year before</a>, when the sales force was over 3 million. Sales for 2010 are said to be $9.2 billion.  Alticor reported sales of $11.3 billion for 2012.]</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;According to <a href="http://www.amway.com">Amway</a>, their annual sales
    amounts to about $7 billion and there are 3 million distributors. Thus, the average
    distributor's sales amounts to about $2,333/yr. If 30% of that is profit, the average
    distributor makes $700/yr. Klebniov claims that the average income is $780, but the
    average distributor buys $1,068 worth of Amway goods himself and also has expenses such as
    telephone bills, gas, motivational meetings, publicity material and other expenses to
    expand the business. &quot;The average active distributor sells only 19% of his products
    to non-Amway affiliated consumers,&quot; according to Klebniov. &quot;The rest is either
    personally consumed or sold to other distributors.&quot;&nbsp; In the United States,&nbsp;
    the Federal Trade Commission requires Amway to label its products with the message that
    54% of Amway recruits make nothing and the rest earn on average $65 a month. No such
    labels are required in other countries, but the facts are clear. Most people who get
    involved in Amway will not make money.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Far from boosting their incomes, the vast majority of those who become Amway
      distributors, particularly those in 'the system', are likely to end up losing money.</font><font size="3" face="Arial">
      </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The majority of the wealth of the tiny number of top-ranked distributors in this
      country comes not just from the sale of Amway products but from selling motivational
      materials and organizing seminars and rallies for the people below them (Thompson).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Amway has made a very few people very rich while paying its foot soldiers more in
    inspiration than in cash (Thompson). There is nothing particularly unique about this in
    the history of business. What is unique is the faith, devotion and hope that the foot
    soldiers have. (Note: the numbers in the paragraph are from 2005-2006.)</font></p>
    <h2 align="center">Is Amway a cult?</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Critics of Amway have compared it to a cult whose main product is Amway itself. Amway
    folk do resemble religious devotees in some respects. They have great faith in their
    company, its products, and the hope for wealth and early retirement. They attend seminars
    and meetings that are reminiscent of revivalist meetings, where the power of positive
    thinking replaces (or is accompanied by) faith in Jesus. Instead of a parade of souls
    healed by faith, Amway faithful are treated to testimonials of early retirement with
    plenty of money. While there have been some accusations of persecution of those who have
    left the flock, by and large Amway devotion seems harmless enough. Amway doesn't seem to
    differ much from other zealous big corporations which preach positive thinking about the
    business of business in endless motivation seminars and retreats, books, tapes, brochures,
    among other things (Klebniov).</font></p>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Graham Baldwin of the United Kingdom compares an Amway motivational meeting to a
    revival or cult meeting. The former university chaplain tries to help people break away
    from religious cults with his program called &quot;Catalyst.&quot; Soon after one of his
    broadcasts, he got a call from a man </font> </p>

      <p><font size="3" face="Arial">who explained how the group he had joined a year earlier was slowly taking over his
      life. There were the huge monthly meetings at venues like Wembley Conference Centre where
      he and thousands of other followers were worked into a passionate frenzy then told to go
      out and find as many new recruits as possible; there was a powerful doctrine that frowned
      on television, newspapers and other 'negative' influences; there was the strict dress code
      and advice on how to bring up children and relate to loved ones; there was the fear that
      to quit would mean giving up hope of a happy future. </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">However, having seen the television show featuring Baldwin, the man now alleged that
      he was being subjected to <a href="mindcont.html">mind control</a> techniques and being
      manipulated by those above him. He wanted advice on making a possible break. Baldwin asked
      which cult the man was in. </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;It's not a cult. It's not a religion. It's something called Amway&quot;
      (Thompson).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">To some of Amway's critics, Amway may look like a religious cult, but to others it just
    looks like a shell game. The ministers of the faith work their magic by constantly calling
    your attention to the quality of their products, their concern with ethics, the wealth of
    their company, their association with Coca-Cola or MCI, the claim that they don't have to
    pay the middleman or advertising costs, and the numerous testimonials of the faithful who
    have passed through the valley of death and have arrived on the mountaintop with buckets
    of gold. Meanwhile, you do not notice that the products are secondary to the process of
    recruiting new distributors of those products. You do not notice that the wealth and
    associations of the company are irrelevant to its promises of wealth to the millions of
    distributors recruited. You do not notice that many costs, such as mailing, handling,
    doing forms, advertising, and driving personal vehicles to deliver or pick up products,
    are picked up by the distributors themselves. You do not notice that even though some
    people make a decent or more than decent living exclusively through Amway, the chances of
    all or most distributors making such wealth are absurdly small. You do not notice that
    while the leaders talk about ethics they are stimulating resentment and greed. And of
    course you never hear the testimonials of those who feel cheated by Amway; dissidents are
    not allowed to give their testimony at revival meetings.</font></p>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The shell game gets even more complicated because when it is pointed out that most
    people who are Amway distributors either lose money (they buy more products from Amway
    than they sell) or make a very modest income, the ministers of the faith don't respond
    honestly and directly by saying that that is what should be expected from such a system.
    Instead they claim that no one said you would get rich quick at Amway; no one promised
    great wealth with little work. Those who fail do so because they are failures. They don't
    work hard enough. They don't devote enough time to their distributorship and recruitment.
    The failures need motivation! </font> </p>
    <h2 align="center">the dissidents</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Paul Klebniov writes that </font> </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong style="font-weight: 400">Former distributors and Amway officials say that like many movements based on a
      cult of personality, Amway's attitude toward any insider critical of the organization has
      bordered on paranoia. Edward Engel was Amway's chief financial officer until 1979; he
      resigned over a disagreement with DeVos and Van Andel [the founding fathers of Amway] on
      how to run the Canadian operations. This apparently branded him a traitor; he says he and
      his family received threats for years after his resignation. &quot;It was a Big Brother
      organization,&quot; says Engel today. &quot;Everyone assumed that the phones were tapped,
      and that Amway had something on everybody.&quot; </strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong style="font-weight: 400">In 1983 Engel's former secretary, Dorothy Edgar, was helping the Canadians in
      their investigation of the company. She was roughed up in Chicago, after she was told to
      &quot;stay away from Amway.&quot; Engel, who picked her up after the incident, says he
      believes her story. Amway would not comment on the incident. </strong>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong style="font-weight: 400">There was extremely bad publicity in 1982 when a former distributor, Philip
      Kerns, quit to write a damaging expose called &quot;Fake it Till You Make It.&quot; Kerns
      charges that Amway used private detectives to follow him and rough him up. Kerns' expose
      prompted the &quot;Phil Donahue Show&quot; and &quot;60 Minutes&quot; to run
      uncomplimentary pieces on Amway. Amway's recruitment dropped off; with it, sales plunged
      an estimated 30% in the early 1980s. </strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In 1984, another former Amway insider, Donald Gregory, says he started to write
      a book on Amway, but the company obtained a gag order against Gregory in a Grand Rapids
      court&quot; (Klebniov).</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Even so, the vast majority of Amway distributors are probably decent people who believe
    in the quality and value of Amway products and who are in it to make money in a legal and
    ethical way. They are not responsible for what the founders or &quot;uplines&quot; do.
    They are not making wild promises about making millions of dollars with just a few hours
    of work a week to their friends. The average Amway distributor is undoubtedly not like
    James Vagyi.</font></p>
    <h2 align="center">Amway comes to Hungary</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Now that capitalism has come to many former communist nations in Europe, Amway has
    spread its ever-replicating roots into countries such as Hungary and Poland. James Vagyi,
    the lead recruiter in Hungary, tells potential recruits that the minimum income is about
    $9,000 a month [700,000 forints]. Mr. Vagyi says to a group of potential recruits,
    &quot;If 10 million people were persuaded for 40 years to build socialism in Hungary, you
    can each find six people to do this.&quot; If those six find six who find six who find
    six, you will be rich in no time. Mr. Vagyi shows his audience a videotape that ends with
    a message from Amway's co-founder, Richard DeVos: &quot;Ethics and caring for people are
    the fundamentals of Amway's business.&quot; Maybe. But apparently some distributors have
    cynical views of ethics and the only people they seem to really care for are themselves.
    Still, isn't this true in every business? Aren't there always a few bad apples who give
    the whole group a bad reputation?</font></p>
    <h2 align="center">Is the appeal to greed or to need?</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">It isn't very likely that the majority of Amway's distributors follow Vagyi's example.
    Nor do they follow the example of Michael Aspel who used a curious recruitment video in
    London. The video &quot;features couples who live in enormous detached houses and have
    luxury cars, talking about how much freedom and independence the Amway opportunity has
    given them. The narrative tells how the company is built on &quot;ethics and
    integrity&quot; and how it has helped &quot;thousands improve the quality of their
    lives&quot; (Thompson).</font></p>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Furthermore, there is no doubt most Amway meetings are not like the one described by
    Paul Klebniov: </font> </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">One weekend this summer over 12,000 enthusiastic people gathered for a rally in
      Richmond, Va. A handful were wealthy distributors of Amway Corp's products; the rest
      wanted to be. The meeting began with a prayer and a Pledge of Allegiance. On stage, Bill
      Britt, the master Amway distributor who organized the rally, introduced the other top
      distributors, who had arrived in their Cadillacs and Mercedes, flaunting expensive furs
      and jewelry. With the introduction of each of these role models, the crowd cheered.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p style="text-align: left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Stories such as Klebniov's inevitably lead to the question, <em>Does
    Amway encourage fraud? </em>The answer is <em>No. </em>However, one of the main
    criticisms made of Amway and other MLM organizations, is that they inevitably encourage
    unscrupulous people to defraud the gullible into thinking that with a little hard work
    they can become rich beyond their wildest dreams. These unscrupulous people become rich
    themselves, not by selling Amway products but by selling the concept of Amway and
    &quot;inspirational materials&quot; such as books, tapes, seminars, etc., aimed at
    motivating a person to think positively. Critics argue that while it is possible to make a
    decent living selling Amway products, a realistic person should not expect more than a
    supplement to one's income from selling the products. The real money is in recruiting
    people into Amway. The really big money is in selling motivational materials, i.e., hope.</font></p>

          <p style="text-align: left">&quot;Amway received millions of dollars from consumers for gift cards that were never redeemed and that contained 'redeem before' dates that have passed,&quot; said James Kawahito, class co-counsel of Kawahito, Shraga &amp;  Westrick LLP (Los Angeles). &quot;In California and many other states, laws designed to protect consumers make it illegal for gift cards to contain any expiration date.&quot; </p>
                <p style="text-align: left">The settlement for deception regarding gift cards comes on the heels of an earlier settlement for &quot;abuses in the operation of Quixtar’s multi-level marketing business....These abuses included structural incentives toward recruitment of other distributors rather than merchandizing; misleading statements regarding Individual Business Owners’ (IBOs) business prospects; overpriced goods that were difficult to market to retail consumers; and inducements for IBOs to spend substantial amounts of money on motivational books and tapes.&quot;<a href="http://www.casewatch.org/civil/amway/proposed_settlement.pdf">*</a> The suit, filed in 2007, alleged that Quixtar (which has since been dissolved by Amway) is an illegal pyramid scheme because most of its sales are to distributors rather than retail customers. The plaintiffs also charged that the company's arbitration policies prevented most distributors from recovering their losses if problems arose. The  settlement called for payment of $34 million in cash and $21 million in free products.</p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">ZDNet reported on Amway's entry into e-tailing
      which is known as <a href="http://www.quixtar.com/"> Quixtar</a>. All Amway agents (now to be known as IBOs: independent business owners)
      have been invited to open up their own e-mall, selling not only Amway
      products but products of other manufacturers as well. The emphasis, as
      with Amway, will be on <a href="mlm.html">multi-level marketing</a>,
      i.e., recruiting new Quixtar agents who are encouraged to recruit agents
      ad infinitum. Agents will get a cut of sales made by those they recruit,
      and by sales of recruits of recruits, ad infinitum theoretically.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Why would the 5th and 6th richest men in the world, Rich
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_DeVos">Devos</a> and Jay <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Van_Andel">Van Andel</a> (d. 2007), founders of Amway, want to get involved with
      Internet sales? For one thing, there is a lot of money to be had in
      e-commerce: they're hoping for $1.5-$2 billion in sales the first
      year...better than Amazon.com or E-Bay. Secondly, sales
      at Amway have dipped recently (18.5% drop in 1998).</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Why not call the new company E-Amway instead of Quixtar?
      That might have something to do with name repulsion.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Will it work? It will certainly work for Devos and Van
      Andel. They will have millions of agents to sell products, including their
      Amway products, from the day they open on September 1, 1999. Unlike
      Amazon.com, who had to spend some time recruiting agents to sell their
      products, Quixtar will be able to bank on Amway agents to aggressively
      market their products from the get-go. How much money will the Quixtar
      agents make? They may think they will become nanosecond millionaires but
      my guess is that they will fare about as well as they did as Amway agents.</font></p>
