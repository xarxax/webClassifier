      <P><EM>From Jackie Chambers:</EM> The beautiful gown arrived Friday. I am 
      so thrilled with it and with the fact that we have found you. Thanks more 
      than I can ever say for the very quick turn around. Have a wonderful 
      Christmas and a very prosperoius New Year. </P>
      <P><EM>From Irma Jaramillo (West coast):<BR></EM>"The concealor has a 
      "great feel" and is very comfortable.&nbsp; I was wearing it while I had 
      an I.V. in place and found that the nurses were able to put the concealor 
      on and off with the velcro closures.&nbsp; They commented on the great and 
      easy fit.&nbsp; The side vents made it easy to ambulate in."</P>
      <P><EM>Dr. Robert S. Merrill, M.D., F.A.C.P.(ret and former head of VA 
      Hospital) says:<BR></EM>"I most heartily recommend the medical care 
      clothing by Weber &amp; Weber.&nbsp; This product should be eagerly 
      endorsed &amp; supported by patients and hospital-clinic staffs 
      alike."<BR></P>
      <P><EM>Ervin L. Schadler (Mid-west):</EM><BR>"I had a joint replaced in my 
      shoulder. I bought several pieces of Ellen Weber's clothing (WeberWEAR) to 
      wear during my hospital stay.<BR><BR>The nursing staff made the comment 
      that all surgical patients should have garments such as what I was wearing 
      because of the ease of getting to the incision. They also commented on how 
      soft the garments were.<BR><BR>The garments are very easy to put on and 
      very easy to remove or open with out any discomfort. <BR><BR>I would 
      recommend Ellen Weber's (WeberWEAR) garments to everyone." </P>
