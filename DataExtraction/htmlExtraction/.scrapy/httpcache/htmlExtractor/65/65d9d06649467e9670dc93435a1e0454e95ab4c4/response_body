<h2 id="Green">Anna Katherine Green</h2>

Anna Katherine Green was an American mystery novelist, whose career
stretched from 1878 all the way to 1923. Her first book, <I>The
Leavenworth Case</I> (1878), was the first American best selling
novel, selling a quarter of a million copies, and earning Green
the title of "The Mother of the Detective Novel". It
starred her series detective, Ebenezer Gryce, a low key, middle
aged New York police officer. Gryce also had a large number of
assistants, such as Sweetwater, and friends, many of whom got
books of their own. 
<P>
The typical Green case opens with the discovery 
of a murder scene. The murder was the result of a nighttime meeting
or encounter; incredible passions usually raged at this meeting,
involving jealousy, blackmail, parent-child conflicts or revenge,
and these passions got out of hand, and led to murder. The detectives
usually do a lot of well done sleuthing at this point, uncovering
hidden facts about the case, various people involved, the earlier
lives of the suspects and so on. This detective work is the best
part of the novel. Just when readers are completely fascinated
by all this sleuthing, the detective story grinds to a sudden
halt, and we are treated instead to a long, long flashback dealing
with the early lives of the characters. The flashback is a regular
novel, not a mystery, and is filled with Victorian melodrama.
Green inherited this flashback technique from <A HREF="gaboriau.htm">Émile Gaboriau</A>,
and one finds similar Gaboriau inspired flashbacks in such 
<A HREF="doyleera.htm">Sherlock Holmes</A> novels as 
<I>A Study in Scarlet</I> (1887), <I>The Sign of Four</I> (1890), 
and <I>The Valley of Fear</I> (1914), where they also
annoy modern readers! Green's flashbacks are even more sinister
and horror filled than those of Gaboriau, or Doyle. 
<P>
Green's novels also suffer in modern eyes by their general lack of puzzle plots,
although there are some good puzzles in her shorter fiction. Despite
these flaws, the best passages of detective work in Green's books
remain first rate. It is a major contribution to the technique
of the detective story, and has influenced numerous Twentieth
Century detective writers.
<h3>Detection in Green</h3>

During the period 1849 - 1885, many mystery stories emphasized
detection. The characters of detectives, and the process of watching
them solve mysteries, were themselves inherently fascinating to
19th century readers. Starting with the <A HREF="casebook.htm">casebook school</A>
founder Waters, and extending through to Dickens, Gaboriau, and
Green, with stops along the way for Waters imitators like Andrew
Forrester, Jr., and the Australians James Skipp Borlase and Mary
Fortune, the process of detection itself was the key element of
the tales.
<P>
By contrast, mystery puzzles, defined as plots with imaginative,
surprising solutions, were not as emphasized. There were such
stories, especially in the American Renaissance of <A HREF="poe.htm">Poe</A>,
<A HREF="hawthorn.htm">Hawthorne</A> and <A HREF="melville.htm">Melville</A>.
Melville's "Benito Cereno" (1855) falls into the start of this era, 
and Richard Dowling's "The Going Out of Alessandro Pozzone" (1876) attempts ingenuity. 
<A HREF="sensatio.htm">Wilkie Collins'</A>
tales also are well plotted, as is Gaboriau's <I>Le Crime d'Orcival</I>.
But it is not till <A HREF="doyleera.htm">Doyle</A> that a systematic
attempt is made at mystery puzzle plot brilliance.
<P>
Stories emphasizing detective work are a little closer to mainstream
fiction than are puzzle stories. Detective tales can be considered
in some ways as realistic stories about detectives, just as other
Victorian fiction focused on realistic portraits of governesses
or clergymen. Detective tales eventually developed story conventions
different from conventional books - after all, detectives unravel
hidden events, so they tell stories "backwards" from
a conventional novel. And detective fiction has many special exciting
events and melodramatic conventions. But still, it is more realistic
and less "genre"-like than a puzzle tale, where pure
ingenuity of plot is the reader's chief interest.
<P>
The best part of Green's <I>The Leavenworth Case</I> (1878) is
the detection in Book 2. Each section brings to new light some
facts about the mysterious Henry Clavering. Much of the detection
is ingenious. Green draws clear lines between detection by amateurs
and the police, and shows the strengths of each with remarkable
vividness, imaginativeness, and clarity. Here the police and amateurs
work together, each contributing numerous pieces to the puzzle.
In later Green novels (1897-1900), Gryce will work with another
amateur, the archetypal spinster sleuth, Miss Amelia Butterworth,
in a relation that includes both the cooperation typical of <I>The
Leavenworth Case</I>, and some competition.
<P>
Later, too, <A HREF="weirdmen.htm">Fergus Hume's</A> <I>The Mystery
of a Hansom Cab</I> (1886) will feature competition between two
detectives for the solution of a case. Douglas G. Greene suggests
that this influenced similar competitions in <A HREF="hanshews.htm">Thomas W. Hanshew's</A>
<I>The World's Finger</I> (1901). I might add the friendly but
exuberant competition between the private eye Mr. Barnes and the
amateur Mr. Mitchell in Rodrigues Ottolengui's five mystery books
of the 1890's, and the more serious (though not necessarily more
ingenious) battles of wits between detectives in <A HREF="hanshews.htm">Zangwill's</A>
<I>Big Bow Mystery</I> (1891) and Leroux's<I> Mystery of the Yellow Room</I> 
(1907). Such detectival competitions seem to be a common feature of 
mystery novels of the era.
<P>
Green shows plenty of gusto, too, in Book 2 of <I>The Leavenworth
Case</I>, with a kind of plotting later standard in the mystery
novel, but probably innovative in its day: the gradual unveiling
of a buried situation, piece by piece. This is all very well done,
and is virtually paradigmatic for later mystery writers. It is
unclear whether Green created this kind of unveiling, but it is
done awfully well by her, and probably influenced later authors.
<P>
Much of the rest of the book is not up to this standard. The detective
known as Q has a good moment near the start of Book 3, and Gryce's
successful attempt to smoke out the killer by his announcement
in the attic at the novel's end is well done, too. But these are
isolated beauties of detection in a none-too-brilliant Books 3
and 4. The detection comes to a screeching halt fairly early in
Book 3, when a second murder occurs. This second murder is paradigmatic
in mystery plots, too, and pops up in a million Golden Age detective
novels. But it interrupts what Green does best in this book, which
is pure detective work.
<h3>The Influence of Detection in Green on Later Writers</h3>

<A HREF="chris1.htm">Agatha Christie's</A> <I>Why Didn't They
Ask Evans</I> (1933) reveals her debt to Anna Katherine Green.
Christie records in her autobiography that Green's works helped
inspire her to become a mystery writer. The influence of Green
is especially apparent in this novel. Green excelled at detection,
the gradually uncovering of hidden facts about a crime, by both
amateur and professional detectives. Such an uncovering is at
the heart of <I>Evans</I>. The logic with which Christie constructs
her plot recalls a similar logic that Green brought to her books.
The whole book has a very Green feel.
<P>
Agatha Christie's development and gradual unveiling of hidden
facts in her books is one of her most appealing and exciting traits.
The reader is always learning about events in the past which might
be hidden crimes, or which could provide motives for the crime
currently under investigation. It is always a thrilling experience
for the reader to see such new perspectives emerge. It is an intellectual
drama.
<P>
Agatha Christie's relationship to Green is paralleled in many
ways by that of American mystery novelist <A HREF="rinehart.htm">Mary Roberts Rinehart</A>
to Green. Rinehart records a similar personal inspiration to publish
her first mysteries from Green's books. In Rinehart's work, there
is a similar emphasis on uncovering a mystery, as well. In a story
like "The Burned Chair", there are plenty of mysterious
events. Each turn of the plot either brings new mystery, or helps
uncover previous mysteries. The relentless, logically inspired
focus on the mystery, seems in an ancestral line from Green.
<P>
Both Rinehart's and Christie's spinster sleuths, Miss Rachel Innes
and Miss Jane Marple, seem directly inspired by Green's Miss Amelia
Butterworth.
<P>
The second Butterworth novel, <I>Lost Man's Lane</I> (1898), seems
especially influential on Rinehart. The way that all the suspects
in Green's <I>Lost Man's Lane</I> live on a single, isolated street,
anticipates Rinehart's <I>The Album</I> (1933); both books concentrate
on five households. And the spooky goings on in the main country
mansion in Green's book anticipate Rinehart's <I>The Circular
Staircase</I>. There is also a spiral staircase, deep within the
mansion in Green's book. The hidden family secrets, long in the
past, will find echoes in many of Rinehart's plots. The serial
killer aspects of <I>Lost Man's Lane</I> return in Rinehart's
<I>The After House</I> (1914). The way amateur-detective-working-with-the-police
Butterworth gets an assignment from Gryce in the opening, and
her comic sparring with Gryce over it, anticipates Rinehart's
nurse detective Miss Pinkerton.
<P>
It has been fashionable to date the modern mystery novel from
<A HREF="bentley.htm">E.C. Bentley's</A> <I>Trent's Last Case
</I>(1913). Bentley's book is certainly a good novel. But long
before Bentley, or his contemporary <A HREF="freeman.htm">R. Austin Freeman</A>,
Anna Katherine Green was a major influence on detective fiction.
Nowhere as good as a constructor of puzzles as later writers,
such as Bentley, Freeman or Christie, she did excel at detection.
And she helped serve as a model for the detective work of modern
writers.
<h3>The Amelia Butterworth novels</h3>

<I>That Affair Next Door</I> (1897) is the debut of Amelia Butterworth,
mystery fiction's original spinster sleuth. The book is at its
best in those chapters (1-9, 16-20, 24) in which Butterworth is
actually detecting. This is partly because Green's skills center
on the detection parts of her books. And partly because Butterworth
is such a fascinating creation. She is richly characterized in
those chapters that display her in full detective mode. The detection
here is more a Gaboriau-like investigation of a crime scene, and
less the gradual look into characters' past history that is often
found in Green.
<P>
<I>That Affair Next Door</I> mercifully lacks the long non-detective
flashback that takes up a major portion of other Green novels.
But it does intersperse several sections, such as the long inquest,
that mainly tell some of the suspects' history in a linear, non-detective
way. These less than gripping passages are largely equivalent
to the boring flashbacks of other Green novels.
<P>
The two brothers in <I>That Affair Next Door</I> recall the two
sisters in <I>The Leavenworth Case</I>. The complex trails left
by the characters anticipate <I>The Chief Legatee</I> (1906).
The depiction of the house where the murder occurs also anticipates
the Violet Strange story, "An Intangible Clue". The
solution of <I>That Affair Next Door</I> shows some affinity to
that of "The Doctor, His Wife, And the Clock" (1895).
It does have ingenuity, in tying up the disparate strands of the
mystery.
<P>
<I>Lost Man's Lane</I> (1898) has a nice opening (Chapters 1-3),
with Butterworth once again sparring with Gryce, while an intriguing
mystery is set forth, complete with map of a spooky country village.
These sections combine comedy with a pleasantly creepy atmosphere.
If some of the Violet Strange tales involve disappearing objects,
this novel centers on vanishing people. Unfortunately, the rest
of the book does not do much to develop this material further,
until the solution (Chapter 39). And in much of the story, Butterworth
seems more like a passive eye-witness to events, rather than a
detective. This book does have some interest, as one of the earliest
of all serial killer mystery novels.
<P>
<I>The Circular Study</I> (1900) shows a similar dichotomy to
<I>The Leavenworth Case, </I>between outstanding detection, and
less enjoyable material. The first half of the book (Chapters
1-10) is a straightforward investigation of a crime, with excellent
detective work. There is a great deal of pleasant humor and entertaining
storytelling as well, in this first half of the novel. At this
point we start learning about the suspects' history, and we are
in another world, Green's unique universe of nightmarish suffering
and horror, where her characters have to endure the most terrible
events imaginable. This flashback look at the suspects' tragic
lives takes up most of the second half of the book.
<h3>Multimedia</h3>

The multimedia aspects of <I>The Leavenworth Case</I> have often
been remarked on, with not just one, but two, floor maps, and
the reproductions of handwritten letters as clues. Perhaps equally
notable is the timeline, a text-only device that is all the same
a radical departure from conventional narrative methods. Was Green
the first to employ this? 
Green's novel is a notable early example of multi-media, over
40 years before Moholy-Nagy and the Bauhaus.
<P>
<A HREF="gaboriau.htm">Gaboriau</A>
used the floor plan in <I>Monsieur Lecoq</I>. There are also floor
plans and other multimedia features in the otherwise dreary <I>Notting
Hill Mystery</I> (1862) by <A HREF="sensatio.htm">Charles Felix</A>.
<P>
Other Green novels continue her innovations in multimedia. <I>The
Circular Study</I> (1900) contains a chapter printed in two columns.
One column shows letters. A second column contrasts the contents
of those (lying) letters with the private diary of one of the
characters. 
<P>
<I>The Circular Study</I> contains another now-standard mystery feature
partaking of multimedia: a list of questions that need to be answered
for the mystery to be solved. Embedding lists in novels is still
not a common feature of mainstream novels, even though it is a
vital part of much subsequent mystery fiction. One can find it
in such on-the-record Green admirers as Rinehart, Christie and
Van Dine. Green adds a final multimedia flourish near the end
of the mystery, one that was <U>not</U> influential on subsequent
writers. She repeats the list, and in the margin she writes "answered"
or "not answered" in handwritten script next to each
question, depending on whether the detective has yet succeeded
in answering the question. Green is clearly feeling exuberant,
and doing "wheelies" with the possibilities of multimedia.
<h3>Publisher's Blurbs</h3>

The blurbs in the back of Green's <I>The House of the Whispering
Pines</I> (1910) are fascinating. They are for a dozen of her
novels, still in print after many years in 1910, and are brief
quotes from contemporary reviewers, taken from journals that no
longer exist, and of which I have largely never heard. Almost
uniformly, the reviewers' quotes stress Green's superb plot construction.
The word "ingenuity" occurs again and again. Well constructed,
ingenious plots must be what both reviewers and readers of the
era wanted. Similarly, Doyle expressed his admiration for Gaboriau's
"dovetailed" plotting, which seemed to him to be a chief
attraction of her work. These attitudes are taken to dominate
the 1920's-1930's Golden Age, but clearly they were prevalent
much earlier.
<h3>Short Stories and Literary Techniques</h3>

The short comic piece "The Mystery of the Blue Wash"
(1889) seems in some ways to be a dry run for ideas later used
more seriously and elaborately in "The Doctor, His Wife,
And the Clock" (1895). There is a lot more pure puzzle plot
technique in Green's short stories than there is in her novels,
at least the ones I have read so far. There are also some similarities
in the kinds of puzzle plots Green investigates. "A Difficult
Problem" (1896) involves a mysterious appearance of a newspaper
clipping, while two of the Violet Strange stories, "The Second
Bullet" and "Missing: Page Thirteen", involve the
disappearance of objects. All five of these tales have broadly
similar kinds of solutions as well, frightening yet plausible.
These solutions bear some resemblance in technique to some of
those of <A HREF="sensatio.htm">Mrs. Henry Wood</A>.
<P>
"Missing: Page Thirteen" shows Green's interest in architecture.
Like <I>The Circular Study</I> (1900), and "The Staircase
at the Heart's Delight" (1894), it takes place in a complex,
unusual building. This fascination with architecture is directly
ancestral to the similar interest in <A HREF="rinehart.htm">Mary Roberts Rinehart</A>
and other Golden Age writers.
<P>
"Missing: Page Thirteen" is also constructed like one
of Green's novels. It has both a modern day plot, followed by
a long Gaboriau-like flashback, filled with horror, explaining
the origin of events and situations in the modern story. While
these flashbacks can seem overblown in Green's novels, here however
it works wonderfully. The whole piece is one of Green's best works.
<P>
Green's "The Second Bullet" shows a technique in which
one mystery is explained, leading to revelations of the inner
situation of a mystery, followed by stripping away a second layer
of revelations, and so on. It is a "box within a box"
approach. "The Second Bullet" is neatly constructed
out of a whole series of such layers. This short story technique
is related in miniature to the detective emphasis of her novels,
in which detective work penetrates deeper and deeper into a mysterious
problem.
<P>
"An Intangible Clue". This tale shows in pure form one
aspect of many Green novels: a scene of the crime, and the detective's
reconstruction of the events that took place there. The crime
is sinister, takes place at a lonely house and is full of strange
coincidences: three Green traits. The detective heroine's visit
to the crime scene, disguised as the gawking of a tourist, reminds
one to a degree of the crime scene in <I>Agatha Webb</I> (1899),
and the people it attracts. The newspaper account in the story
mentions a floor plan, although it is not shown in the Green's
tale. Perhaps such floor plans were once common in real life newspaper
accounts of crime, just as in detective stories.
<P>
Green's stories are remarkably varied. They do not all fit within
one paradigm of crime fiction. Some are detective novels. Others
are suspense stories of crime. Most of the tales in <I>The Old
Stone House</I> (collected 1891) fall in this category, including
the long title novella. This novella seems remarkably similar
to the "suspense" stories written from the 1940's on.
It has no mystery, and focuses on an account of psychologically
abnormal characters whose lives are careening towards murderous
tragedy. This is exactly the paradigm of modern "psychological
suspense" tales. Many of Green's novels also have sections
similar to the modern story of suspense. I'm referring to the
Gaboriau like mainstream accounts of the event leading up to the
crime, that are found at the end of many Green books. I confess
I do not like most of Green's suspense tales, just as I do not
enjoy most modern instances of this genre.
<h3>Dates of the Action in Green</h3>

Another feature is the dating of the action, itself. Many early
mysteries have their action clearly, explicitly dated: <A HREF="casebook.htm">Waters</A>,
<A HREF="gaboriau.htm">Gaboriau</A>, Anna Katherine Green, <A HREF="doyleera.htm">Conan Doyle</A>,
<A HREF="freeman.htm">R. Austin Freeman</A> (<I>The Eye of Osiris</I>),
<A HREF="crofts.htm">Freeman Wills Crofts</A> (<I>The Cask</I>).
One knows the year and the day in which the action occurs. I find
this fascinating. It intrigues me as a reader. It also makes me
want answers to literary-historical questions: What is the origin
and significance of this technique? Does it root in Victorian
realism? Is it unique to the detective novel? If so, was Waters
its creator? I don't know its origin, but its principal effect
is to add to the multimedia nature of the many mystery novels
that employ it. The dates form a different medium for novelistic
creation than linear, prose storytelling, adding another dimension
to the novels' structures.
<P>
Green's work is in fact carefully dated. The action of <I>The
Leavenworth Case</I> takes place in March 1876, over two years
before official book publication in 1878. Was this due to delays
in getting published? This would not be surprising for a first
novel. Was there a magazine publication c1877? I don't know. Later,
in the long short story "The Doctor, His Wife and The Clock",
published separately as a book in 1895, a contemporary Gryce is
narrating a story from his youth, set in 1851. Gryce says that
he was 30 then, so he was born c1820 - 1821. In the novel <I>The
Circular Study</I> (1900), Gryce describes himself as an "octogenarian".
This means that he is at least 80, so his latest possible birthdate
must be 1820. Hence we can conclude that Gryce was born in 1820.
It is possible that Green has an actual birthdate in mind for
Gryce, which is mentioned in some story I haven't yet read. In
any case, this birthdate would make him c55 during <I>The Leavenworth
Case</I>, which agrees with evidence in the story.
<P>
Also, in <I>That Affair Next Door</I> (1897), which is set in
September 1895, the narrator Amelia Butterworth estimates that
Gryce "was seventy-five if he was a day". This too is
consistent with a birth date of 1820. But later in the story,
Gryce's age is given as 78. This suggests a birth date of 1816
or 1817. This is unfortunately not consistent with "The Doctor,
His Wife and The Clock".
<P>
One might also note that in "The Doctor", Gryce says
that he is "now" 70, which makes the present in that
tale to be c1890. Once again, this leads one to suspect that "The
Doctor" had a prior magazine publication c1890. At least
in these stories, Gryce seems to be aging in "real time".
Why did Green set "The Doctor" in 1851? Green was born
in 1846, and would have been around 5 then. Her family lived in
New York City till she was 10. So Green has set this tale in the
time and place of her childhood. Does it draw on childhood memories?
It is such a terrifying work. The opening scene especially, is
one of the most hallucinatory in all mystery fiction. Its atmosphere
and strange sense of dream like brooding are unique.
<P>
"A Difficult Problem" (1896) seems to be another Gryce-narrated
short story, (although the identity of the tale's detective-narrator
is never made explicit), but it makes no attempt at the precise
dating used by Green elsewhere. It is a good tale. It, and the
much poorer Gryce-narrated "The Staircase at the Heart's
Delight" (1894) in the same volume, show an interest in murderous
devices. So do many Green novels. Such devices probably influenced
<A HREF="hibk.htm">Burton E. Stevenson</A> in <I>The Mystery of
the Boule Cabinet</I>. "Staircase" is set in 1840, so
Gryce was already on the force at around age 20. In <I>The Circular
Study</I> (1900), Green says Gryce has completed sixty years of
service. If he is 80 in that novel, that would mean that he started
on the detective force c1840, around age 20. This would make "Staircase"
set at the time when Gryce joined the force. However, Gryce makes
no mention of being a rookie or brand new officer in that tale
- he is simply described as "young".
<h3>Gay Relationships in Green</h3>

Her female characters form close attachments, and are impressed
by each other's beauty. Her male characters similarly evaluate
and note each other's looks. The scenes in <I>Leavenworth</I>
where Mr. Raymond tries, for detectival purposes, to make friends
with Henry Clavering have the feel of an attempted romantic liaison.
It is hard to tell if this effect is deliberate, or an unintended
side effect of Green, as a woman, writing from the point of view
of male and female characters. When Mr. Gryce, as narrator, starts
rhapsodizing about the other male characters' looks in "The
Doctor", is he just speaking for the author, who is female,
and who (perhaps) noticed such things? Or is he in his own character?
Or does Green just trying to create as much romantic feeling as
possible, by emphasizing the good looks of all her characters?
This could simply be a Nineteenth Century romance convention.
Still, interpreted literally, Green's tales have a gay feel. It
adds to their unusual point of view, especially when compared
to today's fiction.
<P>
Amelia Butterworth, in her debut case <I>That Affair Next Door</I>
(1897), describes herself as being influenced by a woman's beauty,
in the same way that men respond to it. She ascribes this to "something
masculine in my nature" (Chapter 24). Butterworth is the
original, prototypical spinster sleuth in detective fiction. It
is startling to see her described as being sexually attracted
to women, and in such explicit terms. Butterworth's masculine
gender personality, and her gay romantic feelings, are an integral
part of the characterization of spinster sleuth. The book's finale
(Chapter 42) also deals with this side of Butterworth.
<P>
Sweetwater in <I>Agatha Webb</I> (1899), his origin novel, is
deeply in love with an older man. Sweetwater will show up in later
Green novels as a continuing detective character. More male-male
relationships pop up in <I>The Circular Study</I>. Gryce talks
of "adopting" the young, male, police detective, Sweetwater,
"into his heart and home". He admires Sweetwater's detectival
abilities, even though his looks are ordinary and plain. Later,
both Gryce and Sweetwater discuss the supreme good looks of another
male character in the book. In another male-male relation in <I>The
Circular Study</I>, the murder victim's manservant has a deep
attachment to the victim, and was "jealous" of the victim's
falling in love with the heroine. Much is made of this jealousy
as a plot element, but the idea that a man can be in love with
another man, and jealous of his other relations, is simply accepted
as a matter of course. Green seems to be in another world from
Twentieth Century detective novelists, one in which same-sex relations
are accepted much more casually than later.
<P>
Same sex relations in Green seem to involve two groups of people.
One is the detective heroes themselves. Miss Amelia Butterworth,
Green's prototypical spinster sleuth, is a lesbian. Mr. Gryce's
adoption of Sweetwater, Mr. Raymond's pursuit of the handsome
Henry Clavering are key examples. One might also add here Q's
disguise as a woman in <I>The Leavenworth Case</I>.
<P>
The second group of people in same sex relations are servants
and other lower class people who fall in love with their masters.
The country woman who is so devoted to Mary Leavenworth, and Joseph's
devotion to his master in <I>The Circular Study</I>, are examples
of this. It is possible that this relationship was more acceptable
to Green's readers, because they liked the idea that the lower
classes were slavishly devoted to the upper. Perhaps the same
sex aspect of these relationships were simply invisible to Green's
19th Century readers, who saw only the political, class relationship
aspect. Be that as it may, it certainly seems very striking today.
<h3>Politics</h3>

Several Green works are political. They paint terrifying portraits
of radical political movements, and the totalitarian control they
exert over ordinary people, especially women. This includes her
anti-Communist book, <I>The Chief Legatee</I> (1906), and her
anti-KKK story, "The Black Cross". Green comes out of
a long tradition of 19th Century writers who feared the rise of
totalitarianism, including Percy Shelley, <A HREF="sensatio.htm">Emily Jane Brontë</A>,
<A HREF="hawthorn.htm">Nathaniel Hawthorne</A> and Joseph Conrad.
Her ideas also remind one of all the radical movements that served
as villains in <A HREF="doyleera.htm">Conan Doyle</A> stories.
Both writers wrote anti-KKK tales.
<P>
Many modern academic critics seem to be Marxists - people whose
politics are the direct opposite of Green's. These writers tend
to see society as evil, and individual people as good. Green's
point of view seems to be the opposite. Green regards the family
as a frequently totalitarian institution, especially in its control
of women by male relatives. By contrast, Green tends to like society,
or at least, the existing capitalist society of her time. People
are happy in Green when they escape from their families, and take
part in the big, and relatively good, world. Equally evil in Green
are radical political movements, which tend to control people,
especially women, in similar totalitarian ways as the family.
<P>
Apparently non-political tales such as "The Doctor, His Wife,
And the Clock" perhaps have a political side. That novella's
unforgettable opening involves an invasion of the heroine's house,
and its taking over by sinister, all controlling forces. So do
"Midnight in Beauchamp Row" and "The Mystery of
the Blue Wash". None of these forces are political, but they
are similar in their totalitarian all-controlling way to the political
forces that take over the lives of the heroines in <I>The Chief
Legatee</I> and "The Black Cross". The heroine of the
later story has her home taken over by the KKK in just the same
way as the protagonists of "The Doctor" and other non-political
tales do. The sinister hotel in "Room No. 3" (1909)
also takes over its occupants' lives, in a somewhat similar way.
<P>
Crime stories of all eras are full of kidnapped heroines. How
do Green's tales, in which not just the heroine's person, but
also her home is taken over, differ from these? The home occupation
tales imply that the heroine's whole life has been taken over.
These tales are metaphors for the control over a person's life
that comes from both the family and from radical political institutions.
<h3>Violet Strange</h3>

Green's detective Violet Strange fits into these political concerns.
Violet Strange is a debutante, a young woman from a well to do
New York City family. She is also sneaking around, working in
secret as a professional detective for a private detective agency,
something that is almost unheard of for someone in her social
class. This work is kept secret from both her family and her Society
friends. Violet Strange is doing this because she needs to raise
money, for a project whose nature is only gradually revealed in
the stories. She is typical of Green heroines who defy their families,
and secretly promote schemes that give them an independent existence.
Violet Strange is less violent and less sinister seeming than
some of the woman suspects in Green's mysteries who are leading
secret lives. But she is just as much a rebel against her family
as any of them, just as determined and personally gutsy, and just
as sneaky and secretive. We eventually learn that Violet Strange
is defying her father, and his dictatorial control over his family.
This too is typical of Green, in whom male control over family
is the root of immense social and personal suffering and evil.
<P>
Although Green lived at a time when there was an active feminist
movement, she does not seem to gave supported active feminist
politics and reforms. We know from Patricia D. Maida's study that,
unlike the later Mary Roberts Rinehart, who marched with the Suffragettes,
that Green opposed giving women the right to vote. By contrast,
Green's fiction often dramatizes the problems facing women in
her time. Her characters are often coping with nightmarish situations
caused by male control over their lives. Green's women do not
seek political solutions to their problems. Instead, they ferociously
rebel in their personal lives, usually by launching some secret,
conspiratorial scheme involving a secret life and activities.
This rebellion is often a mainspring of Green's mystery plots.
<P>
Many of Green's women also struggle to succeed in professions,
and in businesses which they run. Such business opportunities
are usually presented by Green as happy, even joyous experiences
for the women. Violet Strange's pleasant relationship with her
male employer at the detective agency is typical of this. He values
her work highly, and is always eager to talk her into taking on
some case. They have pleasant banter and a friendly relationship.
There is a political dimension to this: in Green, when women escape
from their families, and take part in capitalist society and the
world of employment, their lives become fulfilling and pleasant.
<P>
Violet Strange is one of a long series of Victorian and Edwardian
female detectives who sprang up after the popularity of Sherlock
Holmes. Like Holmes, these women work as professional detectives,
taking on cases for clients. Like Holmes, these women have extraordinary
intellects, solving their cases through a mix of genius level
mental capacity, and professional detective skills. Violet Strange
reminds one of such earlier woman professional detectives, such
as <A HREF="doyleera.htm">Catherine Louisa Pirkis'</A> <I>The
Experiences of Loveday Brooke, Lady Detective</I> (1893), and
<A HREF="doyleera.htm">George R. Sims'</A> <I>Dorcas Dene, Detective</I>
(collected in book form 1897). One suspects that Green had read
some of these authors. Violet Strange goes undercover as a nurse
in a private house in one tale, just like Dorcas Dene did in one
of her adventures.

<h3>The Haunted Station: a short story</h3>

Hume Nisbet's "The Haunted Station" is a supernatural
tale, not a detective story strictly speaking, although it certainly
contains elements of crime. It is just too good to leave off my
list. Between its Australian setting and authorship, and its fantastic
elements, it serves as a reminder that not everything good happening
in detective fiction falls into a single, narrow channel. 
<P>
The theme of murderous passion within a family circle, played out
for maximum drama, does recall the works of Nisbet's contemporary
Anna Katherine Green. 
<P>
So does the use of a vividly described architectural
setting, one that seems to partner with the people in the story,
as the protagonist of the tale. In Green's fiction, the setting
often serves as the title of the tale: <I>The Circular Study</I>,
<I>The House of the Whispering Pines</I>, "The Staircase
at the Heart's Delight", and these unusual buildings co-star
with the human characters as a focus of the tale. You also see
this architectural emphasis in such Green-influenced work as Wilkins
Freeman's "The Long Arm". This focus persists in such
American writers as <A HREF="rinehart.htm">Mary Roberts Rinehart</A>
and <A HREF="hibk.htm">Burton L. Stevenson</A>.
<P>
"The Haunted Station" is reprinted in Stephen Knight's anthology <I>Dead Witness: Best Australian
Mystery Stories</I> (1989), along with many other fascinating tales.

<h2 id="Chambers">Robert W. Chambers</h2>

Robert W. Chambers was an American mainstream, adventure and supernatural writer.
<h3>The Purple Emperor: a short story</h3>

He is today noted by mystery fans for a single, well done 
excursion in their genre, "The Purple Emperor". The
action of this short story is dated to 1894, and was included
in Chambers' 1897 collection, <I>The Mystery of Choice</I>, so
the date of first magazine publication is probably around 1895. 
(What a good title <I>The Mystery of Choice</I> is - how richly poetic.) 
"The Purple Emperor" is also included in the Ellery Queen anthology 
known variously as <I>Sporting Blood</I> (1942) or 
<I>The Great Sports Detective Stories</I>.
<P>
"The Purple Emperor" explicitly mentions "the detective story" at
one point, contrasting the "real life" of the story
with detective fiction. This is another of the many self-reflexive
references to detective fiction within detective stories themselves.
<P>
<b>Links to the Green tradition</b>. "The Purple Emperor" sticks closely to 
the paradigms of the detective story laid down by Anna Katherine Green:
<UL>
<LI>There is a great deal
of emphasis on murderous parent-child hatred, just as in Green's
tales. Jealousy and psychotic rage play roles as well. Green,
and her follower Mary Wilkins Freeman, tended to emphasize only
the most violent and corrosive passions as motives for murder.
One might contrast this with later mystery writers, who often
wrote about motives including personal gain, fear of exposure
of past crimes, or the murder victim as the obstacle to some plan
of the suspect - all far less emotionally explosive issues. 
<LI>Chambers also follows Green in that there is little emphasis on
a pure puzzle plot, but a great deal on detection. All sorts of
clues are followed up, by several of the characters, both amateurs
and the police. (An emphasis on detection was also present in other late 19th Century 
traditions - such as the Scientific Detective tales discussed below.)
<LI>Chambers also follows Green and Freeman in that
the tale has a carefully delimited small town setting, in this
case, in Brittany in France.
</UL>
Chambers is perhaps a bit more macho than his female contemporaries, however,
in that the physical violence in this tale is a bit more explicitly
portrayed.
<P>
It is perhaps significant that when American mainstream writers
like Freeman and Chambers decided to write detective stories around
1895, they followed the approach of Green, and not of Doyle's
Sherlock Holmes stories, then at the peak of their popularity.
Similarly, <A HREF="rhdavis.htm">Richard Harding Davis'</A> handful
of crime fiction will be based on <A HREF="doyleera.htm">Robert Louis Stevenson</A>,
and largely ignore <A HREF="doyleera.htm">Doyle</A>.
<P>
<b>Scientific Detection</b>. During the second half of the 19th Century, 
huge numbers of detective and crime short stories were published in  
American periodicals. A large selection of these are reprinted in 
LeRoy Lad Panek and Mary M. Bendel-Simso's 
<I>Early American Detective Stories: An Anthology</I> (2008). 
"The Purple Emperor" shows links to traditions found in some of these tales. 
(Please see a <A HREF="casebook.htm">detailed discussion</A> of this anthology.)
<P>
Some of these stories in <I>Early American Detective Stories: An Anthology</I> 
are works of <A HREF="moffett.htm">scientific detection</A>. 
"The Purple Emperor" is full of discussions of butterflies and insects, 
conducted at a scientific level. The Purple Emperor that gives the tale its title is a kind of butterfly. 
Science about insects also plays a role in the detective work that solves the case. 
"The Purple Emperor" should be seen as a "scientific detective story", among other things.
<P>
A number of the detective tales in <I>Early American Detective Stories: An Anthology</I> 
are based on "ingenious idea, through which the detective is able to link the crime to its perpetrator". 
This idea is the center, around which the story is constructed. 
"The Purple Emperor" is constructed around such an idea, which forms the finale of the tale. 
Like some, but not all, of such ideas in tales from <I>Early American Detective Stories: An Anthology</I>, 
the idea in "The Purple Emperor" is science-based.
<P>
<b>Another Country</b>. "The Purple Emperor" is an early example, of a detective tale
depicting life in an exotic foreign land. We get detailed descriptions of life in a small town 
in Brittany, and meet various local "types". And as is common in such stories, 
we have an American hero who is visiting the country as a tourist.
Such tales will recur throughout the history of detective fiction. 
For example, "The Purple Emperor" anticipates mystery novels by 
<A HREF="abbott.htm">Aaron Marc Stein</A>, such as 
<I>Three - With Blood</I> (1950) and <I>Mask for Murder</I> (1952), 
both of which are set in small towns in Mexico.
<HR>

<h2 id="Freeman">Mary E. Wilkins Freeman</h2>

<h3>The Long Arm: a short story</h3>

Freeman's "The Long Arm" (1895) seems directly inspired
by the Green tradition. There is a murder that enmeshes the protagonist
in a web of crime, one that seems to be an ugly crime of passion
related to her personal life. There is a suggestion that a dutiful
daughter could kill her parents in cold blood - the shocking possibility
put forth by <I>The Leavenworth Case</I>. There is the sending
away to the big city for a detective, somewhat similar to the
Book 3 of <I>The Leavenworth Case</I>, where detectives are sent
to a small town. Finally, the case is unraveled, proving the daughter
is innocent, and that an outsider did the crime. The motives for
the crime lie in passionate encounters in the distant past - this
is exactly the pattern of denouements in some Green tales (and
in works by other Gaboriauistes). Freeman's tale is a bit marginal;
it is unusual without being great. It is included here as something
of a curiosity.
<P>
Freeman corresponded with Green, sending her fan letters, according
to Green biographer Patricia D. Maida. See Patricia D. Maida's 
<I>Mother of Detective Fiction: The Life and Works of Anna Katherine Green</I> (1989).
<h3>"Doc" Gordon</h3>

Freeman's <I>"Doc" Gordon</I> (1905), was blurbed by
her publisher as a novel of mystery, although this book seems
to be unknown to historians of mystery. Read today, it seems more
like a melodrama or romance, about a family with a lot of personal
secrets. Its ancestors seem more to be the <A HREF="sensatio.htm">Sensation</A>
novels of the 1860's, rather than the pure mysteries of Green.
<P>
Its long opening chapter includes some vivid description of small
town New Jersey life of the era. After this, the book slides into
grimness and dullness, although it does deal with social issues
that are still of current interest.
<h3>Mainstream Short Stories</h3>

Freeman was mainly a mainstream
author, successful in her day, and still prestigious in ours.
For the record, my favorite Freeman non-mystery short stories
are "Louisa" and "The Lombardy Poplar". 
I also enjoyed "A Mistaken Charity", "A Church Mouse",
"The Revolt of Mother" and "A Poetess".
<HR>

<h2 id="Hopkins">Pauline E. Hopkins</h2>

Pauline E. Hopkins was an African-American, one of the earliest
to publish a mystery story. 
<h3>Talma Gordon: a short story</h3>

Another mystery short story by a mainstream author showing the influence
of Anna Katherine Green, is Pauline E. Hopkins' "Talma Gordon"
(1900). It deals with two sisters who are suspects in the murder
of their father, similar to <I>The Leavenworth Case</I> (1878).
It also has the elaborate, emotion laden prose style familiar
from Green. 
<P>
This story is better as mainstream
tale than as a mystery. The rather ordinary locked room plot is
given two separate solutions by the author, one legitimate and
fair, the other now considered passé.
<P>
"Talma Gordon" is reprinted in the anthology 
<I>Spooks, Spies, and Private Eyes: Black Mystery, Crime and Suspense Fiction</I> (1995), 
edited by Paula L. Woods.
<h3>Hagar's Daughter</h3>

Hopkins' <I>Hagar's Daughter</I> (1901-1902) is a Dickens-like
novel, mixing well-defined characters of all classes and races,
social analysis and commentary, romance, melodrama, and crime
elements. In the last third, a murder plot is introduced. It is
not a mystery, in the strict sense - the villain and his motives
are made clear early on to both the reader and the main characters.
This is a mainstream novel that includes crime as part of its
plot - not a mystery story. 
<P>
But it does include detectives. These 
include the head of the US Secret Service, brought into the case
by the romantic heroine, and an amateur sleuth, the heroine's
black maid, Venus Johnson. Venus Johnson, who does most of the
actual detecting in these sections, is the earliest known black
detective in fiction, according to Stephen F. Soitos' history
of black crime fiction, <I>The Blues Detective</I> (1996). Hopkins
stresses Johnson's courage, resourcefulness, and above all, her
intelligence. After doing some investigating on her own, she goes
to the Secret Service chief, offering her services. He sends her
out on a successful mission. We also get glimpses of professional
black operatives in the Service's employ.
<P>
Hopkins' concepts of detectives builds upon those of Green. The
Secret Service chief is middle aged, around 60, shrewdly professional,
but mild mannered, a characterization recalling Green's Ebenezer Gryce. 
He both employs professional assistants, like Gryce's Q 
and Sweetwater, and collaborates with amateur sleuths, just as
Gryce does with Amelia Butterworth. However, his collaboration
with a black woman goes beyond anything envisioned in Green.
<P>
Hopkins' writing is very dramatic. Many of the scenes, such as
those in the courtroom, cry out for stage presentation, and it
is hard to believe that Hopkins did not have some such notion
in her head while writing them. This book would make an excellent
movie or TV show.
<HR>

<h2 id="Rice">Elmer Rice</h2>

<h3>On Trial</h3>

Elmer Rice's play <I>On Trial</I> (1914) is still grippingly readable,
today. John Chapman, in his introduction to <I>Famous Plays of
Crime and Detection</I> (1946), edited by Van H. Cartmell and
Bennett Cerf, says that <I>On Trial</I> is both the first courtroom
drama, and the first stage play to use a flashback. I have been
unable to verify independently these assertions, but if true,
they represent an astonishing achievement. Rice's play takes full
advantage of the temporal freedom offered by flashbacks, weaving
all over different time periods in the story in a creative way.
<P>
<I>On Trial</I> includes some mysteries in its reconstruction
of a murder. These mysteries do not include the identity of the
guilty party, which is never in doubt. But other aspects of the
plot, initially baffling and mysterious, are slowly clarified,
revealing many of the details of the case. The story thus uses
some features of the true mystery story, combined with non-mystery
elements of the crime thriller. 
<P>
The defense attorney in the trial
is most responsible for uncovering these hidden facts; he functions
somewhat like the detective in a traditional mystery story. The
defense attorney is not, when the play opens, clearly marked as
the detective character; he only gradually emerges in this role
throughout the play. Similar "emerging detectives" are
found in other American mystery plays of the era, such as Bayard
Veiller's <I>The Thirteenth Chair</I> (1916) and <A HREF="hibk.htm">John Willard's</A>
<I>The Cat and the Canary</I> (1922). These plays, like <I>On Trial</I>, 
are to be found in <I>Famous Plays of Crime and Detection</I>.
Rice's and Willard's plays seem much better to me than Veiller's,
by the way, although Veiller's work is far from dull.
<P>
Rice is mainly a mainstream author of plays, not a mystery writer.
Like several other American mainstream writers, when he did include
mystery elements in his work, he drew on paradigms established
by Anna Katherine Green. Such mainstream writers include Mary
E. Wilkins Freeman, Robert W. Chambers, Pauline E. Hopkins and
William Faulkner.
<P>
In its mystery and crime elements, Rice's play involves traditions
dating back to Anna Katherine Green. As in Green's work, we have
a sinister crime taking place at night, in a darkened household.
As in Green, the crime is based on deep, overpowering passions,
that explode into violence. As in Green, these passions have long
hidden roots in the characters' lives, and as in Green, the desperate
characters' experiences are ultimately seen to have political
dimensions: here ideas related to women's lib. As in Green, detective
work involves a deep dive into the characters' past lives and
histories. A detailed understanding of the complex events taking
place at the crime scene is also important both here and in Green.
As in many Green works, a lawyer helps out with the detection.
As is often the case in Green, the crime takes a long time to
unravel, and the detection is tied in with melodramatic, emotional
events in the lives of the characters. Green wrote several mystery
stories in which only one explanation seems possible, but which
later give rise to alternate explanations: Rice does the same
here. The formal inventiveness of Rice's play, involving both
courtroom drama and flashbacks, perhaps relates to the multimedia
proclivities of Green.
<h3>Street Scene</h3>

Like Rice's later play <I>Street Scene</I>, literary aspects of
<I>On Trial</I> come out a tradition of "naturalism",
the frank examination of the sordid side of people's existence.
Naturalism is essentially part of mainstream literary fiction,
including such writers as Émile Zola, Frank Norris and
Theodore Dreiser. It has less to do with mystery fiction traditions.
<P>
<I>Street Scene</I> (1929), Rice's Pulitzer Prize winning play,
has some elements of crime, but no mystery or detection. It is
mainly a realistic look at the lives of a block of tenement dwellers
in New York City, and has little to do with mystery fiction per
se. The play is happy in its adaptations: composer Kurt Weill
turned it into a fine opera (1947), broadcast on cable TV a few
years back; while the author himself adapted the original play
for a superb screen version (1931), directed by King Vidor. The
fairly short movie version is badly cut, compared to the original
play, but it is superbly acted, directed and photographed.
<HR>

<h2 id="LeeThayer">Lee Thayer</h2>

Lee Thayer was a hugely prolific writer of detective novels. Her
sixty books stretch from <I>The Mystery of the 13th Floor</I>
(1919) to <I>Dusty Death</I> (1966), published when she was 92.
Despite this output, she is nearly forgotten today, and her books
seem to have largely disappeared. 
<P>
Francis M. Nevins' article on Thayer from <I>1001 Midnights</I> has been reprinted 
(with permission) on-line at <A HREF="http://mysteryfile.com/blog/?p=7619">Mystery*File</A>. 
It is largely negative in its appraisal. Nevins has also published a career overview 
of Thayer in a <A HREF="http://mysteryfile.com/blog/?p=7756">second article at Mystery*File</A>. 
This gives a rich look at her career as an artist, including samples of her Art Nouveau like 
book design, plus more realistic book jackets. It notes running motifs in her plotting, 
including large machines that transport people in her mystery solutions. 
It also gives hints about where her best books might be found.
<P>
In 1958, Lee Thayer guest starred on the TV game show <I>What's My Line</I>. 
<h3>Series Characters</h3>

All but one of Thayer's novels deals with private detective Peter Clancy. Clancy is based in
New York City. Peter Clancy is genteel, and far from the usual image of a "tough" private eye.
<P>
Clancy's much older partner is retired police Captain O'Malley. 
O'Malley is introduced, as an active policeman, in the second Clancy book <I>The Unlatched Door</I>. 
In that early book, Clancy is also working as a policeman, and O'Malley is his boss. 
In the third Clancy novel <I>That Affair at "The Cedars"</I>, Clancy is described as a private detective: 
something he will remain as, throughout the series.
<P>
Both men frequently work with friendly Lieutenant (later Captain) Jacob Kerrigan of the New York police. 
<P>
All of these characters are explicitly
Irish, including the red-haired Clancy, and it is not hard to
see a resemblance to the New York City Irish protagonists
of Isabel Ostrander's fiction, which also emerged in the decade
of the 1910's, a few years before Thayer's.
<P>
In many later novels Clancy is aided by his English valet Wiggar. 
Francis M. Nevins says Wiggar first appeared in <I>Dead Man's Shoes</I> (1929).
<h3>The Mystery of the 13th Floor</h3>

<I>The Mystery of the 13th Floor</I> (1919) is the first mystery about sleuth Peter Clancy. 
It is best in its opening (Chapters 1 - 7). 
<P>
<b>Architecture</b>. All aspects of the mystery in this opening 
are carefully set against the office building where the crime takes place. 
Even in this first mystery Thayer is <I>architectural</I> in her approach. 
The title <I>The Mystery of the 13th Floor</I> also emphasizes the architectural setting.
<P>
The lawyer has his own private entrance to his personal office, different from 
the main entrance which passes through his support staff. This anticipates the later law office 
of Perry Mason in <A HREF="gardner.htm">Erle Stanley Gardner</A>.
<P>
<b>Sleuth</b>. Peter Clancy is an adult in all the later books. 
But here he unexpectedly makes his debut as an office boy, who is "almost fifteen". 
He has no last name here, and is just known as Peter. 
In his next book <I>The Unlatched Door</I> (1920) he is all grown up, 
and gets his full name of "Peter Clancy" for the first time.
<P>
Peter is an engaging character, full of gusto, detectival ambition and a warm heart. 
He gets good dialogue, and seems like a real person.
<P>
Peter is Irish, and comes from a poor family. He works two jobs, 
office boy by day and newspaper vendor by night. He is clearly designed to 
give a sympathetic portrait of Irish-Americans.
<P>
<b>Impossible Crime</b>. <I>The Mystery of the 13th Floor</I> is blessed 
with a well-done impossible crime, mystifying in its puzzling situation, 
surprising yet sound in its solution. 
<P>
The explanation of the crime is simple: it barely takes Thayer 
a paragraph to explain it during the mystery's solution.
<P>
The set-up or premise of the impossible crime in <I>The Mystery of the 13th Floor</I> 
has some broad resemblances to that of the impossible crime puzzle in <I>Q.E.D.</I>. 
SPOILERS:
<UL>
<LI>In <I>Q.E.D.</I> it looks impossible for the killer to have approached the victim without leaving tacks in snow.
<LI>In <I>The Mystery of the 13th Floor</I> it looks impossible for the killer to have approached the victim without 
leaving a trace in a conference room tightly packed with furniture.
</UL>
The solutions of the two impossibilities are very different, however.
<P>
<b>Romance</b>. Early chapters suddenly stop the mystery plot, and flash back 
to the romance of a couple of young characters. I thought initially that this would be annoying. 
Surprisingly, the romance flashback is charming. It features lyrical descriptions of the countryside. 
Thayer's gift for lyrical nature writing will return in <I>Q.E.D.</I>. 
The rural setting of the flashback contrasts with the rest of the novel, which is mainly set in Manhattan.
<P>
The flashback includes a fishing episode, also anticipating <I>Q.E.D.</I>. 

<h3>That Affair at "The Cedars"</h3>

<I>That Affair at "The Cedars"</I> (1920-1921) is the third Clancy novel.
<P>
<b>Mystery Plot</b>. <I>That Affair at "The Cedars"</I> shows certain Thayer 
traditions. There is an in-depth investigation of the crime scene. 
Evidence from the body is used to reconstruct the death - and to show that 
the crime is actually murder. Thayer will be using such investigations 
to establish the fact of murder, as late as <I>Still No Answer</I> (1958). 
In both books, such establishments take place fairly early on in the story.
<P>
<I>That Affair at "The Cedars"</I> has a puzzle plot. 
I found the main murder mystery easy to guess. Still, Thayer is in there trying, with an 
attempted surprise. By contrast, a subplot twist fooled me.
<P>
<b>Setting</b>. "The Cedars" is a country mansion on Long Island. It is near the water. 
<I>Still No Answer</I> is also set at a country house near water.
<P>
<b>Sleuth</b>. Sleuth Peter Clancy describes himself as a "private detective" 
(last part of Chapter 9, and again in Chapter 27). As best I can tell, Peter Clancy 
will continue to be a private detective throughout the rest of the novels that feature him. 
<P>
However, in <I>That Affair at "The Cedars"</I> he just happens to be staying nearby 
at the time of the killing. He is brought into the case at first 
to please a friend. Then he just keeps on sleuthing, essentially as an 
amateur investigator. He has no client, and does not at all behave 
here like most private eyes in fiction. 
<P>
We learn nothing in <I>That Affair at "The Cedars"</I> about Clancy's 
private detective business. And there are no series characters present other than Clancy. 
There is also no mention of Clancy growing up in poverty as 
depicted in <I>The Mystery of the 13th Floor</I>.
<P>
In <I>That Affair at "The Cedars"</I> private detective Clancy is a houseguest of the rich and 
socializes with them on a plane of equality. This lacks plausibility. 
It is impossible to imagine, for example, <A HREF="hammett.htm">Dashiell Hammett's</A> 
private eyes Sam Spade and the Continental Op being invited to pal around with the upper class. 
Even highly respectable middle class businessmen found it impossible 
to cross class barriers to socialize with the rich, in that era.
<P>
Much is made in <I>That Affair at "The Cedars"</I> of Clancy having been 
in the US Secret Service during World War I (start of Chapter 4, Chapter 8). 
<h3>Q.E.D.</h3>

<b>Green Traditions</b>. Lee Thayer's work seems directly in the tradition of Anna Katherine Green. 
The resemblance is especially close in an early novel such as <I>Q.E.D.</I> (1921):
<UL>
<LI>One can start with the title: Green liked letter titles like <I>X.Y.Z.</I> (1883). 
<LI>The setting of the murder in <I>Q.E.D.</I> strongly resembles those in Green: 
it takes place at night, in a large, isolated, largely shut up building, one
whose huge scale seems to dwarf the participants, following a
sinister, dramatic confrontation. The setting here especially
recalls that of Green's <I>The House of the Whispering Pines</I> (1910). 
<LI>As in Green, there are plenty of details left at the
crime scene that allow investigators to reconstruct the events
of the evening. These evidential remains tend to have a sinister
quality in both writers.
</UL>
These crime scene investigations are
some of the best parts of <I>Q.E.D.</I>, and they stretch out
over the first half of the novel. Many of these scenes take place
outdoors. Thayer's lyrical descriptions of nature are especially
beautiful and enjoyable. Much of <I>Q.E.D.</I> takes place in
the New Jersey countryside, although parts also transpire in Manhattan:
it has the "country and city" double point of view frequently found in Green.
<P>
<b>Impossible Crime</b>. <I>Q.E.D.</I> is an impossible crime novel. 
Its solution also follows Green traditions, although one hesitates to spoil it by
giving away the solution here! Thayer's impossible crime plot
is logical and well constructed. It is of the "one set of
footprints in the snow" variety, anticipating John Dickson
Carr's <I>The Problem of the Wire Cage</I> (1939). Impossible
crimes concerning footprints appear in pre-Thayer authors: for instance, 
<A HREF="moffett.htm">Samuel Hopkins Adams'</A> "The Flying Death" (1903).
<P>
<b>Sleuth</b>. Clancy's sociological status is difficult to determine. He is
a private investigator, but very different from the <A HREF="hardboil.htm">hard-boiled</A>
sleuths soon to follow in the pages of <I>Black Mask</I> magazine
(from 1923 on). Clancy shows plenty of grit and determination
in his work. He vigorously follows up clues in the woods and at
the crime scene. He has plenty of energy, engages in some high
speed car chases when necessary, and is relentless about grilling
suspects. However, he does not seem to be especially "tough",
and violence against underworld crooks does not seem to be part
of his repertoire. 
<P>
Clancy emerges from Anna Katherine Green's concepts of detectives
and detection. Like the sleuths in Green's novels, both amateur
and professional, he mainly seems like a person whose mission
is to uncover the hidden facts behind crime, and to do so in a
straightforward, imaginative and energetic way. As in Green, much
of the action of the Thayer books takes place among New York Society suspects. 
The well dressed, polished Clancy fits right in with these people. 
<P>
At times, Clancy resembles <A HREF="vandine.htm">S.S. Van Dine's</A>
Philo Vance to come. The names Philo Vance and Peter Clancy even
have a certain similarity. However, Vance, like Ellery Queen,
always works closely with the police, and uses their authority
to perform investigations. Clancy seems to investigate largely on his own.
<P>
<b>Race</b>. <I>Q.E.D.</I> has some decent virtues in mystery plotting and 
nature writing. Unfortunately, it has a serious flaw: 
there are some racist remarks (start of Chapter 7, start of Chapter 14).
<h3>Murder Is Out</h3>

<b>Van Dine</b>. The resemblance to Van Dine is stronger in later Thayer books,
such as <I>Murder Is Out</I> (1942). <I>Murder Is Out</I> takes
place in the same upper crust Manhattan home as a typical Philo
Vance novel, such as <I>The Benson Murder Case</I> (1926). The
victim has elderly female relatives living on the premises, just
like the missing man in Van Dine's <I>The Kidnap Murder Case</I>
(1936). Thayer puts emphasis on ballistics and bullet paths in
her book, just as Van Dine did in <I>Benson</I>. Great emphasis
is placed on whether the front door was locked or not, as in Van
Dine's <I>The Scarab Murder Case</I> (1930). Clancy walks in to
the murder building and starts investigating on his own, just
as Vance did in that earlier novel.
<P>
In real life Thayer was an artist, and an interior designer. She
describes the decor in the murder victim's library with considerable
élan. This might not be entirely a personal interest, however:
the Van Dine novels also place great emphasis on details of the
surroundings, and Thayer is paralleling the Van Dine school tradition
here. 
<P>
<b>Upper Class Clothes</b>. Thayer was also interested in clothes. 
It is mainly the men's clothes that are described in detail in this novel, although
women's clothes were discussed in <I>Q.E.D.</I>. She likes the
elegant tailoring of the upper crust, and her own detective Clancy
dresses like a well to do gentleman. Clancy performs an office
invasion in Chapter 6 of <I>Murder Is Out</I>: he walks right
into a Wall Street financier's private office, and he looks so
dignified and upper class that no one dares offer any resistance.
There are hints in this behavior that his polished looks are a
bit of a pose, designed to allow him to pull off stunts like this. 
<P>
<A HREF="rogue.htm">Rogues</A> (in fiction) were non-violent crooks who often 
adopted the clothes and manners of the upper classes to pull off their schemes. 
Clancy uses the same techniques. The Rogues often acted as if they were 
thoroughly enjoying their upper class impersonation. Clancy does too.
<P>
<b>Women</b>. <I>Murder Is Out</I> is not anywhere as well written as <I>Q.E.D.</I>.
The bubbles have really gone out of Thayer's champagne, and it
is hard to see contemporary readers enjoying this slow moving,
dull book. However, the book has some interest in dealing with
the sexual harassment of women, and these parts still seem relevant today.
<P>
The two elderly sisters, among the victim's family, are well drawn. 
They recall a bit the Beagle Sisters in the mysteries of 
<A HREF="abbott.htm">Torrey Chanslor</A>, who had just appeared in a pair of novels (1940, 1941). 
However the sisters in <I>Murder Is Out</I> never become sleuths, unlike the Beagle Sisters.
<P>
<b>Thayer Traditions</b>. The best part of <I>Murder Is Out</I> is probably the opening (Chapters 1-5). 
This moves with admirable directness into Clancy's discovery of the murder, 
and meeting the victim's family and other suspects. It is set at night, 
and combines mild spookiness, elaborate architecture, and good storytelling. 
More nocturnal adventures occur in <I>Evil Root</I>, also set against architecture. 
Both works also include mysterious anonymous messages. doctors, 
colorful elderly women, and people summoning Clancy to crime scenes.
<P>
Green's work is frequently confused with Rinehart's by modern
critics. The distinctness of the two authors and their literary
traditions is worth emphasizing, however. Thayer's work shows
little resemblance to either <A HREF="rinehart.htm">Rinehart's</A>
or to Rinehart's followers, the <A HREF="hibk.htm">HIBK school</A>.
We are not plunged into a soap opera dealing with the personal
relations of the characters, for instance. Instead, the focus
is entirely on Clancy and his investigation, in the Green tradition.
<P>
<b>Race</b>. <I>Murder Is Out</I> has a policeman voice racial slurs (Chapter 7). 
<h3>Evil Root</h3>

<I>Evil Root</I> (1949) is Lee Thayer's 50th mystery novel, something she notes in her dedication. 
<I>Evil Root</I> is structured as a celebration. It revives characters from Thayer's 
<I>Murder Is Out</I>, notably sweet little old lady Abbie Stanhope. 
It also recounts Peter Clancy's origins as a detective (Chapter 5), 
his valet Wiggar's background and first association with Clancy (Chapter 11), 
and has Clancy re-meet a married woman he has loved hopelessly and platonically from afar (Chapter 24). 
One suspects most of these brief accounts are summaries of events from earlier Thayer mysteries.
<P>
<I>Evil Root</I> is often charming in its storytelling, especially in its long opening section (Chapters 1-10). 
But it is mainly worthless as a mystery, with uninspired puzzle plotting, at its worst in the solution to the crimes.
<P>
<b>Architecture</b>. <I>Evil Root</I> mostly takes place at an upscale retirement home. 
So does <A HREF="chris1.htm">Agatha Christie's</A> <I>By the Pricking of My Thumbs</I> (1968), 
and <A HREF="ngmarsh.htm">Michael Innes'</A> <I>Honeybath's Haven</I> (1977).
<P>
The Home is described in detail. Its inside layout is enhanced by a floor plan, 
supposedly drawn by Peter Clancy himself. The grounds of the estate also come in for 
some of Thayer's vivid descriptive writings of natural settings. 
All of this pleasantly reflects the Golden Age interest in architecture and landscape.
<P>
<b>Race</b>. <I>Evil Root</I> is perhaps best described as dated, but not malicious, in its treatment of race. 
On the negative side, the black servants talk in dialect, and there is comedy about their 
fondness for boyfriends. On the positive side, they are depicted as honest, sensible and good at their jobs. 
Such a portrayal was already old-fashioned by 1949. 
<P>
But Thayer also has a point to make: an unsympathetic policeman is shown as racially prejudiced, 
something the novel implicitly condemns as wrong (Chapter 22). 
Thayer shows an awareness of the evils of prejudice, a growing issue in the Civil Rights era.
<P>
<b>Mystery Plot</b>. SPOILERS. <I>Evil Root</I> has a mystery plot construction that is odd, and not very good. 
Clancy is called in at the start to listen to suspicions of the Home's residents. 
These suspicions turn out to be a complete case: the residents know what crimes have been committed, and who did it! 
While the suspicions are unproven, at the end of the story they turn out to be 100% correct. 
This means the tale's main mystery is already solved, right from the start. 
The residents don't know how the crimes are being done medically: but this too is dropped into Clancy's lap 
by a doctor, halfway through the novel (Chapter 12). It is not figured out by Clancy himself.
<P>
There is a second murder halfway through the book, somewhat separate from the rest. 
It has its own puzzle, but it is not very creative. 
Its best part: the investigation of the knife and wound (Chapters 16-17). 
This is an example of the way Thayer is good at episodes right after a killing is discovered, 
where interesting deductions are made through investigating the corpse.
<P>
I didn't enjoy or approve of the way Clancy withholds information from the police. 
Private investigators in novels often do this, but it seems deeply impractical to me, 
not to mention illegal. Also, Clancy is criticized by a policeman towards the end (Chapter 30), 
for not taking action or contacting the authorities, as soon as he hears the residents' 
suspicions at the start. One must agree. Considering how many bad things are 
going on at the home, the Governor should have sent in the National Guard, and put the place 
under martial law! 
<h3>Still No Answer</h3>

<I>Still No Answer</I> (1958) is a late detective novel of Thayer's. 
The setting has charm, even if the mystery plot is simple and uninteresting. 
<I>Still No Answer</I> is one of several mystery novels set on a small island, 
with a house and grounds restricted to a single family and their visitors. 
This always makes for an interesting locale. The water, woods and fishing aspects recall 
Thayer's <I>Q.E.D.</I>, from nearly forty years before.
<P>
Thayer also gets interest from the Canadian background: the novel takes place 
in British Columbia. Thayer shows different kinds of Canadian police 
investigating the crime, giving a pleasant, if simple, look at Canadian police procedure. 
Gentility is definitely the watchword, in Thayer's respectful treatment of all 
things Canadian.
<P>
It is pleasantly old-fashioned, to see sleuth Peter Clancy still talking in 1958 using 
articulate speech patterns recalling Philo Vance. By contrast, his valet Wiggar 
seems dated. Wiggar investigates among the servants, while Clancy hobnobs with the 
upper class, just like Wimsey and Bunter in <A HREF="sayers.htm">Dorothy L. Sayers</A>. 
I confess I never especially liked such "valet of the detective" characters, and 
they seem to have even less plausibility in the more egalitarian world of 1958.
<P>
The best parts of <I>Still No Answer</I> occur early on (Chapters 1-4). 
The early chapters include some mild but genuine detection, with deductions being made 
after studying the corpse. 
<P>
The novel as a whole suffers from a paucity of suspects: the servants on the island are all 
too nice to be suspected of murder, and there are not that many other characters 
to serve as potential killers. 
<HR>

<h2 id="Hobart">Donald Bayne Hobart</h2>

<h3>The Cell Murder Mystery</h3>

<b>Structure</b>. Donald Bayne Hobart's <I>The Cell Murder Mystery</I> (1931) shows
lively storytelling, especially in its first half (Chapters 1
- 14). Hobart juggles a huge cast of characters - 14 people in
addition to the police detectives - and keeps coming up with new
connections between them. This makes for an interestingly designed
story, especially in the book's first half.
<P>
His solution is just ordinary, however, and contains few clever puzzle plot ideas.
<P>
The first half of Hobart's novel covers the original night of the
murder and its investigation. The characters all then go to sleep,
and the second half deals with the next day. This is similar to
the ground plan of several <A HREF="carr.htm">John Dickson Carr</A>
novels.
<P>
<b>Influences</b>. Hobart's technique is hard to place. Hobart wrote at the height
of <A HREF="vandine.htm">S.S. Van Dine's</A> popularity, but there
is only a little sign of his influence. Hobart's detective is
the chief of police in a mid size American city. He is definitely
neither a genius nor an amateur, unlike Van Dine school sleuths.
The first victim is a millionaire businessman, and his partner
is another character, but everyone else in the novel is either
middle class or working class. This is utterly unlike the upper
crust characters one often finds in Golden Age novels, including
those of the Van Dine school. In a financially modest way, some
of the characters are members of the intelligentsia, including
writers, an artist and an actress - a more Van Dine like cast,
although these are mainly very young people trying to start out
on their professions.
<P>
Hobart's policemen, while realistic, do not resemble those of
the Crofts school of police <A HREF="realist.htm">realism</A>,
either. There is no emphasis on exhaustive leg work, scientific
detection in police labs, alibis, or other features of the Crofts
school. The police in <I>The Cell Murder Mystery</I> are all old
fashioned Irish cops. They are all patrolmen who've risen through
the ranks. They are far less world weary or cynical than the tired
cops of the typical police procedural book. Instead, they remind
one of the working class stiffs of old murder mystery movie cops.
The fact that there are several police characters, each with a
role to play in the investigation, does remind one of the detailed
police casts in the novels of Van Dine and his followers.
<P>
Hobart's book instead rather resembles the American detective
stories of 1915-1920, written immediately before the rise of the
Golden Age in 1920. The good natured but tough, energetic Irish
detectives recall the many Irish sleuths in Isabel Ostrander and
Lee Thayer. The private detective here who is a supporting character
also reminds one of the serious but non-hard-boiled private sleuths
of these writers, gifted, determined, and energetic. The murder
setting, a big mansion at night, with all the characters traipsing
around the grounds and house, reminds one of <A HREF="rogue.htm">Octavus Roy Cohen</A>
and Ostrander. In fact, the physical layout of the crime is very
similar to that of Cohen's <I>The Crimson Alibi</I> (1918-1919),
with the murder taking place in the victim's study, a room accessible
both from within his house, and from the verandah on the front
of the house. The medium size town of Hobart's book, North City,
reminds one of the equally fictional Berkeley City of Cohen's
novel. Both of these places are large enough to be completely
modern. Yet both are much smaller than New York City or other
great metropolises.
<P>
Writers such as Cohen and Thayer form a tradition ultimately influenced
by Anna Katherine Green. However, Hobart's novel is less Green
like than either Cohen or Thayer. He does not emphasize the "crime
of passion" aspects, and there is less emphasis on reconstructing
the crime from physical clues.
<HR>

<h2 id="Post">Melville Davisson Post</h2>

<h3>The Strange Schemes of Randolph Mason</h3>

Melville Davisson Post's <I>The Strange Schemes of Randolph Mason</I>
(1896) deals with a clever, perverse attorney, who uses his knowledge
of the law to set criminals free. Published in America just a
year before the Rogue school got fully underway in England, the
portrait of criminality in this book is much more realistic. In
<I>The American Rivals of Sherlock Holmes</I>, Hugh Greene points
out the greater enthusiasm of American writers for realistic portrayals
of crime; Post is part of that tradition here. The characters
here are not elegant gentleman cat burglars; they are underworld
crooks ("The Men of the Jimmy") and embezzling government
officials ("The Sheriff of Gullmore"). "Jimmy"
is a pretty good story, with its underworld detail, but "Sheriff"
overwhelms the reader with the Southern oratory of its crooked
sheriff, and shows Post's lamentable tendency, here and elsewhere,
to substitute endless streams of rhetoric for plot, character,
and everything else. Mason's enthusiastic, cynical criminality
makes an odd contrast with the later Abner's militantly macho
religiosity. One wonders if they are the two sides of a single
attitude. Both characters seem misanthropic, and profoundly mistrustful
of the people around them. Both are also defenders and protectors
of people much less strong then they are: Mason of criminals,
Abner of the helpless innocent, and his nephew.
<P>
"Two Plungers of Manhattan" is much more light hearted
- and enjoyable. The social background of the tale, among upper
crust New York businessmen, is very similar to <A HREF="moffett.htm">Arthur B. Reeve</A>
and some of <A HREF="hanshews.htm">Jacques Futrelle</A>, almost
a decade before they began writing. Perhaps this style of looking
at American business is fairly common in popular fiction of its
day.
<P>
Mason's legal technique is not what modern readers would perhaps
expect; he does not get men off on "technicalities",
such as improper police procedure. Instead he has his defendants
openly commit full, brazen, if unorthodox crimes, and then demonstrates
to the judges that current statutes simply do not cover these
unusual offenses. At the core of the Mason tales is a logical
analysis of the way legal statutes are written. It is the point
of view of a legal scholar, perhaps, but more especially that
of a logician: someone concerned with logic itself. Post is perhaps
pointing out a limitation in human reason's full ability to cover
and foresee all cases; it is a practical demonstration of an idea
that will be argued more philosophically in "The Straw Man".
<h3>Post's Influence From Gaboriau and Green</h3>

Much of Post's detective fiction turns on interpreting physical
evidence to reconstruct a crime: the approach is right out of
<A HREF="gaboriau.htm">Gaboriau</A>, but taken by Post to ingenious
new heights. Post likes to argue backwards from a physical behavior
of a man to his mental characteristics, an approach that will
later be followed by <A HREF="blochman.htm">Helen McCloy</A>.
Post is also good at describing large, empty, sinister country
buildings, places that seem reminiscent of Anna Katherine Green.
<P>
Post's "The Corpus Delecti" is obviously intended by
him to be the centerpiece of <I>The Strange Schemes of Randolph Mason</I> (1896). 
It is both readable, and absolutely shocking, but is it good? 
It is impossible for me to recommend this story, 
a piece that was instantly controversial in its day, and one that
still has the ability to offend. One can set Post's tale into
some cultural context. The murder in the story draws on, but radically
changes, the tradition of Anna Katherine Green. As in Green, the
murder takes place during an assignation between two people in
a lonely country house at night. Deep secrets of the past lives
of the characters are being dredged up at the meeting, and one
character is threatening to expose the other. There is an atmosphere
of deep horror. However, in Green people act out of overwhelming
passion, and the murder has strong elements of chance, whereas
in Post the crime is premeditated, and done in the coldest blood
in American crime fiction.
<P>
Post's fiction as a whole shows other similarities to Green:
<UL>
<LI>There is an alternation in both writers between country and New York
City settings: in Post's case, the countryside is West Virginia.
<LI>Several of Green's works are historical mysteries: so are Post's
Uncle Abner and Colonel Braxton tales. This historical setting
is most unusual in mystery before the current post-1990 boom in historical
mystery fiction.
<LI>Lawyers are prominent in Green's fiction; so
are they in Post's Randolph Mason tales. Both Post and Green's
father were lawyers.
<LI>Green's fiction often focuses on upper middle
class people in deep trouble: this is exactly what Randolph Mason
specializes in getting people out of.
<LI>There are sinister wedding
scenes in both writers (Post's "Corpus Delecti", Green's
<I>That Affair Next Door</I>, which was written <I>after</I> Post's
story).
<LI>There is an atmosphere of horror in both writers.
<LI>Green's murder scenes can have aspects of death pacts: see also Post's
"The Survivor".
<LI>Bad people can invade your home in Green,
and do terrible things: see also Post's "Two Plungers of
Manhattan".
<LI>Charles A. Norton has speculated in his book
on Post that the scenes of Randolph Mason's mental breakdown might
have personal or autobiographical elements for Post. This is possible,
but one might point out similar scenes of guilt-induced madness
in Green, e.g., "The Doctor, His Wife, and The Clock" (1895).
</UL>
<h3>Post's Influence on the Scientific School</h3>

Writers possibly influenced by "The Corpus Delecti"
might include <A HREF="moffett.htm">Meade & Eustace</A>, in
"The Man Who Disappeared", and <A HREF="freeman.htm">R. Austin Freeman</A>.
The story is full of scientific detail, just as in Meade, Eustace
and Freeman. It includes the tradition found in all of these later
writers of making it difficult to prosecute a murder if the body
is destroyed. There is a further possible influence on Freeman's
development of the inverted tale in <I>The Singing Bone</I> (1910
- 1912). Post's preface to the Mason stories trumpets the fact
that he has written a new type of detective story, one which switches
the focus from traditional approaches. Freeman makes similarly
worded claims in the preface to <I>his</I> book. Post's tales
of legal evasion, and Freeman's inverted stories, both start out
with the criminal committing the crime in full view of the reader.
In Post, evil lawyer Randolph Mason then proceeds to get his client
off, based on shortcomings in the law, whereas in the second half
of Freeman's tales, his detective then proceeds to crack what
look like perfect crimes. Clearly, these two new types of innovative
detective stories have a great deal in common, although there
are vast differences, too.
<h3>Uncle Abner, Master of Mysteries</h3>

Post's most famous collection, the Uncle Abner stories, are a
series of historical crime tales, set in 19th Century West Virginia,
in the early United States. They are full of Post's views on religion,
democracy, philosophy and morality.
<P>
"Naboth's Vineyard" (1916) gives an impressive and moving
account of the workings of democracy. It became a favorite of
American critics in the 1940's, when the problems of totalitarianism
became overwhelming. In 1950, an EQMM poll of mystery experts
ranked it the #8 mystery short story of all time. It would still
make a good story for people to read in school, although it seems
much less well known today. The stories' basic mystery plot has
been much imitated in recent courtroom dramas, always without
credit to Post. Post underlined this stories' significance by
making it the final tale in <I>Uncle Abner</I>.
<P>
Many of the Abner tales involve complex legal issues. Post was
a lawyer, and these legal details seem to be carefully researched.
Often they are interwoven with the financial details of the cattle
business and land-owning in 19th Century West Virginia. Post makes
these legal ideas part of his story, helping to build his plots.
Usually these legal tangles show imagination, and make for enjoyable
reading. One story that is almost all law is "The Tenth Commandment"
(1912). Most of the story details ingenious legal swindles in
the tradition of Post's Randolph Mason tales. There are some murder
elements in the tale, but they are simple and in the tradition
of the "physical trail of evidence in the woods" that
Post like to construct. This story is hardly a "detective
story" in any conventional sense of the term, having little
actual mystery to detect.
<P>
Several of the Uncle Abner tales show Abner reconstructing a murder
based on clues left at the murder scene. Usually these clues are
highly physical, and consist of foot prints, horse tracks, blood
stains, broken down bushes, and other trails of physical evidence
in the Gaboriau tradition. These stories tend not to be fair play:
Post does not share what Abner sees at the crime scenes with the
reader. Consequently, the stories consist of little more than
the reader watching Abner reconstruct the crime. This sort of
tale has much prestige; many critical traditions accord much weight
to such exercises in pure detection. I confess that a little of
this goes a long way with me, especially when the tales lack fair
play. Examples of this include the first Abner tale, "The
Angel of the Lord" (1911), and the last story in the 1910's
series, "The Concealed Path" (1918), as well as "The
Devil's Track" (1927). Other tales have a few more puzzle
plot elements, but are basically in this same mode, such as "The
God of the Hills" (1927).
<P>
By contrast, four of the Abner stories are much more significant
considered as puzzle plot tales. These four tales, along with
the politically impressive "Naboth's Vineyard" (1916),
form the key works of the Abner series. "The House of the
Dead Man" (1911) is a genuine detective story. It too concentrates
on tracks of evidence, here mainly horse tracks. But these are
nearly shared fully with the reader, and in the initial stages
of the story, making the tale nearly completely fair play. Post
also makes these part of a full mystery tale, with ingenuity expended
on the interpretation of the tracks in a battle of wits with the
reader, and with other aspects of the plot also taking part in
the puzzle. This story also has some of the emotional depth of
Post's best fiction.
<P>
"The Treasure Hunter" (1915) is a full-bodied, puzzle
plot, fair play detective story. Considered as a formal mystery,
it is probably the best of the Abner stories. It is in the Doyle
tradition, of an isolated household with melodrama and conflict
within, and under siege from without. As in Doyle, mysterious
secrets are held by the characters. The reader knows these secrets
exist, but only gradually learns what they are. This adds complexity
to the plot.
<P>
Post's "The Straw Man" (1917?) has a feel of both <A HREF="hanshews.htm">Chesterton</A>
and <A HREF="boucher.htm">Borges</A>, in its paradoxical discussions
about the place of reason in the universe, and its related look
at the philosophy of detection. It also has some ingenious deductions
from evidence.
<P>
"The Edge of the Shadow" (1918) also recalls Chesterton,
in that it contains a bizarre, imaginative crime made to stand
allegorically for a political and religious debate. Both the near-surrealism
of the events, and the strange twists and turns of the mystery
plot, also seem Chestertonian. As in Chesterton, many of the suspects
in the tale are extremists and fanatics in their cause. As in
Chesterton, the story opens with a tableaux witnessed but barely
understood by the detectives; only gradually do they manage to
ascribe meaning to it. As in Chesterton, the detectives watch
but do not interfere with events. The detectives also walk from
locale to locale in the story, also a familiar Chesterton technique.
The story is so close to Chesterton's style that it almost seems
like a Chesterton tale.
<P>
Uncle Abner was created by Post in 1911, one year after Chesterton's
Father Brown stories started to appear in magazines. The two sleuths
have often been linked as religious detectives. It is unclear
if there was any actual historical influence of Chesterton on
Post. The most Chestertonian Uncle Abner tales seem to come at
the end of the series, around 1917 and 1918, although they may
have been written much earlier.
<P>
In addition to the above four puzzle plot tales, the other best
Abner story is "The Riddle" (1912). "The Riddle"
is not really a puzzle plot tale. It does offer a series of ingenious
variations on the theme of "the hidden treasure".
<P>
Many of the Abner tales do not seem to be that well plotted. "The
Hidden Law" (1914), for example, is little more than a series
of word plays. It does serve as a dry run, however, for Post's
classic code story, "The Great Cipher" (1921), which
uses similar techniques, but more creatively.
<P>
"The Doomdorf Mystery" (1914) is often cited as Post's
cleverest plot. Unfortunately, the central idea is probably lifted
from <A HREF="hanshews.htm">M. McDonnell Bodkin's</A> "Murder
by Proxy" (1897), from <I>Paul Beck, the Rule of Thumb Detective</I>,
which has a similar mechanism. Bizarrely, "The Doomdorf Mystery"
just keeps getting reprinted, and being treated as a "classic",
despite the easy availability of Bodkin's story in anthologies.
<P>
The Uncle Abner tales have been praised as among the finest of
all mystery tales. They were especially admired by the main American
mystery critics of the Golden Age: S. S. Van Dine, Ellery Queen,
Howard Haycraft, Anthony Boucher. The last three are on record
as claiming that the Abner stories are the finest book of American
detective short stories since Poe. Such a valuation is also implicit
in Van Dine's comments. I confess that despite a few exceptions
listed above, the Abner tales as a group are a big disappointment
to me. Far from being great, many of them seem to be poor works
of detective fiction. At his best, Post was a gifted writer of
mysteries, with literary gifts as well. Still, I find it hard
to believe he was a better short story writer than <A HREF="hanshews.htm">Jacques Futrelle</A>,
<A HREF="hammett.htm">Dashiell Hammett</A> and <A HREF="queen1.htm">Ellery Queen</A>,
to name only the three most obvious candidates.
<h3>Politics</h3>

On Abner's politics: Back in the Abner era, Abner's Evangelical
Christian religion was strongly associated with liberal, even
far left causes. It was not till after World War II ended in 1945
that some, but not all, such Christian groups began to associate
themselves with what is now known as the Religious Right. Post's
characters are passionate about their religion, but they do NOT
seem to be at all related politically to what we today think of
as the Religious Right. The enthusiasm of card-carrying liberals
such as Ellery Queen and Anthony Boucher for the tales is further
indication that the Abner tales are not expressions of right-wing
ideas.
<h3>Abner Country</h3>

Post had a gift for landscape. Many of the Abner tales take place
in the woods, and along country roads and fields. This feel is
sometimes strongest in Post's genuine detective stories, most
of which have vividly described settings. Post's tales are also
full of domesticated animals, especially horses, cattle and dogs.
<P>
Post was born (near Clarksburg), lived for much of his life (in
Grafton or near Clarksburg), went to the university (West Virginia
University in Morgantown), and practiced law (in Wheeling) in
the same small northernmost region of West Virginia where the
Abner stories are set. It's an extremely small area by American
standards - only a small fraction of the state itself. Back in
the days in which the Abner tales are set, all of West Virginia
was part of the state of Virginia itself - the two states did
not get separated till later. There are even smaller areas used
by mystery fiction: <A HREF="hammett.htm">Dashiell Hammett</A>
lived, worked (in a jewelry store), and set the bulk of his mysteries
all within a few city blocks of each other in downtown San Francisco!
Abner country is bigger than that. But still, this is regional
fiction with a vengeance.
<P>
One might note that <A HREF="carr.htm">John Dickson Carr</A>
was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, right across the northern
border of Abner country, and that <A HREF="rinehart.htm">Mary Roberts Rinehart</A>
was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, just a little bit further
north.
<h3>Post and S. S. Van Dine</h3>

The point counterpoint dialogues and the discussion of detectival
technique in "The Straw Man" also anticipate <A HREF="vandine.htm">S.S. Van Dine's</A>
Philo Vance tales. There might be an influence - Van Dine selected
this work for his anthology. Van Dine apparently started Post's
high critical prestige, ranking him with Poe and Doyle as a mystery
writer.
<P>
There are other similarities, as well. Uncle Abner is a gifted
amateur detective, who works with the local Justice of the Peace,
Squire Randolph, at his request, as a friend and unofficial consultant.
This is exactly the status of Philo Vance, and his relationship
to the D.A. Markham. Both Uncle Abner and Philo Vance are members
of the gentry. Both Post and Van Dine put heavy emphasis on the
literary quality of their work. And both Post and Van Dine emphasize
fairly simple ideas for the solutions of their cases - neither
is as elaborate as Queen or Carr, for example.
<P>
Van Dine is a writer with such a strong, individual personality.
Single handedly, he carved out an entirely new paradigm for the
detective novel, one that was used as a model by many of the best
American detective writers of the Golden Age: <A HREF="queen1.htm">Ellery Queen</A>,
<A HREF="abbott.htm">Anthony Abbot</A>, <A HREF="abbott.htm">Rex Stout</A>.
One can also see Van Dineian influence in <A HREF="abbott.htm">C. Daly King</A>,
and in the pulp writer of weird menace tales, <A HREF="weirdmen.htm">Paul Chadwick</A>.
<h3>The Silent Witness</h3>

I am enjoying reading stories about Colonel Braxton by Melville
Davisson Post, in a way I never enjoyed most of the Uncle Abner
tales he wrote a decade earlier. The stories turn on some ingenious
pieces of evidence, making them well plotted puzzle tales. And
the courtroom drama in them is vividly described. Also, I enjoy
the characters in the tales, who seem to come alive, in their
own romantic way.
<P>
The narrator of the stories is recalling events he saw in 19th
Century West Virginia as a boy. It never occurred to me that the
narrator was anything other than a fictitious character. But the
narrator's grandfather describes one of his relatives as having
the last name Davisson (in "The Witness in the Metal Box").
This presumably means that the narrator of the tales is none other
than Melville Davisson Post himself, recounting events he allegedly
saw as a child. Post has inserted himself as the narrator of some
otherwise fictitious events, the only real life character in a
fictional world. This approach is not unique: <A HREF="literary.htm">Somerset Maugham</A>
did the same thing repeatedly in some of his short stories. Not
to mention Bill Griffith inserting himself as a character in his
wonderfully surrealistic comic strip, "Zippy". Still,
it is unusual and distinctive. The narrator of some of the Uncle
Abner tales is similarly a man recounting events he saw as a young
boy in West Virginia; while he is not supposed to represent Post,
he is a predecessor to the narrator of the Braxton stories.
<h3>Recommended Reading</h3>

Charles A. Norton has written a fine biography and critical study
of Post, <I>Melville Davisson Post: Man of Many Mysteries</I>

depth, story by story. <HR>

<h3>The Black Cloud: a short story</h3>

"The Black Cloud" (1959) is an anti-lynching tale, set
in a rural community. Politically, it is in the tradition of William
Faulkner's <I>Intruder in the Dust</I> (1948) and <A HREF="woolrich.htm">Charlotte Armstrong's</A>
"The Enemy" (1951). The vividly created West Virginia
atmosphere also recalls Melville Davisson Post. The tale has nothing
to do with Fred Hoyle's classic science fiction novel, <I>The
Black Cloud</I> (1957). The story has a simple but nicely constructed
puzzle plot. It is an example of how many completely forgotten
tales lurk within the corpus of mystery fiction. It appeared in
the September 1959 <I>Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine</I>.<HR>

<h2 id="Faulkner">William Faulkner</h2>

First, some chronology. Discouraged by his career as a mainstream
novelist, Faulkner wrote the lurid thriller <I>Sanctuary</I> in
the first half of 1929; it was not published (in revised form)
till 1931. In Fall 1929 he wrote the classic gothic short story,
"A Rose For Emily" (published 1930). In early 1930,
he wrote "Smoke", the first of his mystery stories featuring
lawyer Gavin Stevens; it was published in 1932. At this point,
Faulkner went back to his main career of mainstream novelist,
writing the non-mystery <I>As I Lay Dying</I>, and many other
books. In the late 1930's he brought Gavin Stevens back in three
more short stories, "Monk" (1937), the mediocre "Hand
Upon The Waters" (1939), and "Tomorrow" (1940).
Although the three tales maintain tenuous links to crime fiction,
"Monk" and "Tomorrow" are basically mainstream
stories. In late 1940 Faulkner wrote what is far and away the
best of the Gavin Stevens short stories, "An Error in Chemistry",
although it was rejected and not published till 1946, in a contest
in <I>Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine</I>. Like "Smoke", this
is a real mystery story. It startles with its especially well
done plot. This seems like a full, Agatha Christie style, intuitionist
mystery tale. After World War II, Stevens starred in the novel
<I>Intruder in the Dust</I> (1948), and in the novella "Knight's
Gambit" (1949), which was expanded from an unsold 1942 short
story. 
<P>
Faulkner's short stories were written for the slick magazines
of the era, such as the <I>Saturday Evening Post</I>. The detailed regional
and rural realism of the stories was shared by other slick writers
who appeared in the <I>Post</I>, such as <A HREF="police.htm">MacKinlay Kantor</A>.
The Post was clearly far more interested in these aspects of the
stories than in their mystery elements, as witnessed by their
acceptance of the realistic "Tomorrow" and their rejection
of the more mystery oriented "An Error in Chemistry".
<P>
Faulkner's gothics recall Anna Katherine Green. "A Rose For
Emily" seems especially close to Green's "Missing: Page
Thirteen". <A HREF="queen1.htm">Ellery Queen</A> pointed
out that the tales about Uncle Gavin Stevens are reminiscent of
Post's about Uncle Abner. They also remind one of Post's Colonel
Braxton stories; both are about clever lawyers practicing in the
rural South, and both have a great deal of information about the
financial aspects of farm life in them. The resemblance to Braxton
is especially strong in the first tale, "Smoke" (written
1930). In "Smoke", we see Stevens in the courtroom,
pulling off courtroom tricks. This is in the tradition not just
of Post's Braxton, but of other slick magazine lawyers of the
era; <A HREF="unalign.htm">lawyer fiction</A> was very popular
in the slicks in 1930. The contrast between virtuous country lawyer
and evil representatives of the big city, present in "Smoke",
was also part of other slick lawyer stories of 1930: see <A HREF="hibk.htm">Hugh McNair Kahler's</A>
"Fair and Stormy" (1930), for example. Stevens does
not become "Uncle" Gavin till the second and much later
story, "Monk" (1937). The resemblances of the character
to Post's Uncle Abner seem to have been added then. Stevens does
a great deal of moralizing and preaching, just like Abner.
<P>
However, Stevens' detective technique is not especially modeled on Abner's. 
The plotting in "An Error in Chemistry" seems closer to 
<A HREF="hanshews.htm">Chesterton</A>.
<P>
A persistent theme of the Stevens stories is men who have been
raised by other men. There are very few women characters at all.
Faulkner often includes very detailed life histories of his characters;
these function as essentially mainstream stories within the stories,
and show Faulkner's literary skills at mainstream fiction (for
example, the first half of "Monk").
<P>
While his two best tales "A Rose For Emily" and "An
Error in Chemistry" are mystery classics, much of Faulkner's
fiction is horribly depressing. I debated a long time about including
Faulkner in the Guide at all. He is a morbid writer. If you go
on to read a lot of Faulkner, and he makes you feel terribly blue,
please don't blame me. You have been warned! 
<HR>

<h2 id="Lawyer">Lawyer Stories</h2>

Three years before <A HREF="gardner.htm">Perry Mason's</A> 1933 debut,
many of the conventions of lawyer and trial fiction were in full
swing in America's mass circulation fiction magazines. <A HREF="hanshews.htm">Carolyn Wells</A>
included three 1930 lawyer stories from <I>Collier's</I> in her
<I>Best American Mystery Stories</I>. While none of these stories
are real puzzle plot tales, all three are entertaining pieces
of storytelling. Two of them are full of ingenious lawyer's courtroom tricks. 
She also included a similar courtroom tale by Melville Davisson Post, 
who had previously created the granddad of all clever lawyers
in Randolph Mason, in the 1890's. William Faulkner 
also created his lawyer detective Gavin Stevens in 1930, for slick
magazine publication. 
<P>
Shortly before, Frances Noyes Hart's <I>The Bellamy Trial</I> (1927) was a best seller. 
I thought this book was very dull, but it showed an appetite among the American public
for this sort of fiction. Hart set her story among the professional
people of the upper middle class, the sort of people that <A HREF="rinehart.htm">Mary Roberts Rinehart</A>
was always writing about, but her work moves at a snail's pace
compared to Rinehart's. It also seems far more remote from the
Perry Mason tradition of courtroom pyrotechnics than are the three
<I>Collier's</I> stories, or the Melville Davisson Post piece.
<P>
The three <I>Collier's</I> pieces are by four authors who are
completely obscure today, some of the least known writers in Wells'
collection: Mrs. Wilson Woodrow, C.C. Waddell, Jerome Beatty,
and <A HREF="hibk.htm">Hugh MacNair Kahler</A> ("Fair and Stormy"). 
I had never heard of any of these writers, and
knew nothing about them. (Some research on Kahler appears in the
article about him.) By contrast, the authors she included from
the <I>Saturday Evening Post</I>, while not necessarily famous
names in mystery fiction, have at least made more of an impact
on popular culture, including general publishing and Hollywood
screenwriting. Maybe the <I>Post</I> was a much greater platform
to launch a literary career.

<HR>
<h2 id="Woodrow">Mrs. Wilson Woodrow</h2>

"Mrs. Wilson Woodrow" was the way Nancy Mann Waddel Woodrow signed her books and short stories. 
Her husband James Wilson Woodrow was reportedly a cousin of President Woodrow Wilson. 
In the 1901-1934 period in which she published, "Mrs. Wilson Woodrow" would have been 
a dramatic, catchy name. Mystery fiction is apparently only a fraction of her output, which concentrates on mainstream fiction. 
She also wrote articles, and the biography of her husband cited below says she served on 
"the editorial staff of the Daily News, of Chillicothe, owned by her brother C. C. Waddle" 
in her home town of Chillicothe, Ohio. This was likely during 1896-1897, before her main writing career. 
(C.C. Waddell's first name seems to be Charles.)

<h3>Pulp and Slick</h3>

Mrs. Wilson Woodrow published in both pulp and slick magazines. This makes it hard to categorize 
her as either a "pulp writer" or "slick writer". 
<P>
During 1920-1921, she published at least seven short stories about her lawyer-sleuth Heywood Atchison 
in <I>The Red Book</I>, a pulp magazine. These show her writing lawyer fiction at an early date.
<P>
By contrast, her short story "Atchison Always Wins!" (1930) was published in the slick magazine <I>Collier's</I>.
<P>
While reprint collections from the pulps are fairly common, reprints
from the slick magazines are unfortunately rare. One of the
few is <I>American Murders</I> (1986), edited by <A HREF="kkbeck.htm">Jon L. Breen</A>
and Rita A. Breen. This reprints 11 of the mystery novellas that
appeared in the slick <I>American Magazine</I> nearly every month
between 1934 to 1956, and contains an annotated bibliography of
the <I>American</I> novellas. 
<P>
The series of <I>American Magazine</I> novellas began in March 1934 with Mrs. Wilson Woodrow's "Eyes at the Window". 
<h3>Pawns of Murder</h3>

<I>Pawns of Murder</I> (1932) is a murder mystery novel starring Woodrow's series sleuth, lawyer Heywood Atchison. 
<I>Pawns of Murder</I> is mainly a dull book, although its mystery plot has a few strengths. 
<P>
<b>The Theater</b>. <I>Pawns of Murder</I> has a Broadway theater background. Unfortunately its theater characters must 
be the dullest found in any theater-mystery. We are used to theater novels by 
<A HREF="ngmarsh.htm">Ngaio Marsh</A> and others, full of scintillating dialogue, colorful characters 
and references to the complex traditions of the stage. By contrast, the theater people in 
<I>Pawns of Murder</I> are colorless and the stage background is lifeless. 
This might be deliberate on Woodrow's part: her theater characters long to escape the theatrical life 
and become "normal people", and the theater is seen as a negative place, full of crooks 
and sleazy demimondaine types. Still, the sheer dullness of these characters makes for joyless reading.
<P>
<b>The Rich as Dysfunctional</b>. Many rich people in Mrs. Wilson Woodrow are also portrayed as dysfunctional. 
The "heroine" of <I>Pawns of Murder</I> is a spoiled rich girl, used to getting anything she wants, and with no common sense or discretion. 
She has no virtues other than being rich, young and pretty: she is not smart, gutsy, compassionate or generous. 
She makes a thoroughly unpleasant person to read about, over the course of a long novel. 
<P>
Her boyfriend Brett Harlow is one of the few upper class or rich people portrayed by Mrs. Wilson Woodrow as having ability. 
He has inherited factories and manages them well. Later, he will do some good sleuthing. 
He is in love with the heroine, but she keeps pushing him away. 
Frankly, it is hard to see why this guy wants to marry the heroine. She is beautiful, from a "good family" 
and wealthy, and the novel seems to take for granted that any upper class young man would want her for a spouse. 
Maybe that is the way the world works. She certainly would be "socially acceptable" to Harlow's family and friends. 
Still, Brett Harlow could do a lot better, if he has any concern for the character or ability of the woman he hopes to marry. 
<P>
<b>Mystery Plot</b>. BIG SPOILER. The chief merit of <I>Pawns of Murder</I> is the way it traces the crime to the Least Likely Person. 
The identity of the killer was a big surprise to me at the end, someone I never suspected. 
Making the murderer be The Least Likely Person is a convention of the traditional mystery puzzle. 
Mrs. Wilson Woodrow does it well here.
<P>
<b>Stein: A Jewish Detective?</b>. Atchison employs a detective to help him, Irving Stein (Chapter 13). 
Stein is described as young and skilled. He is admirable and sympathetic. 
From his name, one wonders if Stein is supposed to be Jewish. This recalls another sympathetic character, 
the hero's friend Jake Gottschalk in "Atchison Always Wins!", who is not explicitly described as Jewish, but who has a Jewish sounding name.
<P>
Stein is a professional detective. Atchison pairs him in his investigative assignment with 
another sympathetic character, businessman Brett Harlow. This is Harlow's first work as a detective: 
he is strictly an amateur. The pairing of a professional like Stein and and amateur like Harlow 
recalls Anna Katherine Green.
<P>
<b id="HumanChess">The Book Jacket: Human Chess Pieces</b>. The book jacket shows characters standing on a checkerboard floor, 
suggesting they are giant, human pieces on a chess board. 
This is presumably inspired by the book's title, <I>Pawns of Murder</I>. No such chess game occurs in the actual novel. 
<P>
There are examples of human chess pieces in other creators' works. 
The title cards of the silent film <I>A Girl's Folly</I> (<A HREF="mtour.htm">Maurice Tourneur</A>, 1917) 
show the director maneuvering human chess pieces, as a metaphor for him telling the actors where to stand. 
<P>
Such chess games with humans standing in as chessmen on a large board became a staple of comic books:
<UL>
<LI>The <A HREF="drfate.htm">Dr. Fate</A> tale, "The King of Crime" (More Fun Comics #76, February 1942).
<LI>The <A HREF="strngadv.htm">Captain Comet</A> tale, "The Cosmic Chessboard" (Strange Adventures #35, August 1953).
<LI>The <A HREF="greena.htm">Green Arrow</A> story "The Human Chess Game" (Adventure #219, December 1955).
</UL>
<h3>Atchison Always Wins!: a short story</h3>

"Atchison Always Wins!" (1930) is a short story written by Mrs. Wilson Woodrow and C.C. Waddell 
(perhaps her brother the newspaperman). 
This tale of a lawyer trying to win a big but hopeless looking case is fun. 
The tale's climax is a trial, complete with courtroom theatrics. The courtroom scenes are well done.
<P>
"Atchison Always Wins!" has a murder mystery plot, with a man found mysteriously shot, 
and the killer unveiled at the end. This plot is pleasantly complex: which makes for good story telling. 
However, the identity of the murderer is none too surprising, and the tale lacks ingenious puzzle plot elements.
<P>
The crime takes place among people who are undergoing extreme emotions. This recalls Anna Katherine Green. 
So does the way in which one suspect really looks guilty.
<P>
The suspects in "Atchison Always Wins!" include both theater people, and wealthy upper class types, 
just like <I>Pawns of Murder</I>. And as in that book, both groups are seen as dysfunctional, failed people. 
But unlike the dull folks in <I>Pawns of Murder</I>, the characters in "Atchison Always Wins!" are interesting to read about. 
Both the lawyer hero and his opponent the District Attorney also come alive.
<P>
The hero's friend Jake Gottschalk is a pleasant character. Although this is not made explicit, 
I think from his name and theater producer profession that readers are supposed to understand that he is Jewish. 
(The real-life Louis Moreau Gottschalk was America's first great classical music composer, and was from a Jewish family. 
So the name Gottschalk is prominently associated with a famous Jewish American.) 
Including a sympathetic Jewish character in a 1930 story is an admirable Civil Rights statement. 
Jake Gottschalk is not a suspect in the mystery. Instead he has the role of the detective hero's friend, 
sort of a Watson character, although he does not narrate the story.
