        <p><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>T</B></FONT>wo old Bachelors were living in one 
          house;<BR>
          One caught a Muffin, the other caught a Mouse.<BR>
          Said he who caught the Muffin to him who caught the Mouse,--<BR>
          'This happens just in time! For we've nothing in the house,<BR>
          'Save a tiny slice of lemon nd a teaspoonful of honey,<BR>
          'And what to do for dinner -- since we haven't any money?<BR>
          'And what can we expect if we haven't any dinner,<BR>
          'But to loose our teeth and eyelashes and keep on growing thinner?' 
        </p>
        <P>
Said he who caught the Mouse to him who caught the Muffin,--<BR>
'We might cook this little Mouse, if we had only some Stuffin'!<BR>
'If we had but Sage andOnion we could do extremely well,<BR>
'But how to get that Stuffin' it is difficult to tell'--
<P>
Those two old Bachelors ran quickly to the town<BR>
And asked for Sage and Onions as they wandered up and down;<BR>
They borrowed two large Onions, but no Sage was to be found<BR>
In the Shops, or in the Market, or in all the Gardens round.
<P>
But some one said, -- 'A hill there is, a little to the north,<BR>
'And to its purpledicular top a narrow way leads forth;--<BR>
'And there among the rugged rocks abides an ancient Sage,--<BR>
'An earnest Man, who reads all day a most perplexing page.<BR>
'Climb up, and seize him by the toes! -- all studious as he sits,--<BR>
'And pull him down, -- and chop him into endless little bits!<BR>
'Then mix him with your Onion, (cut up likewise into Scraps,)--<BR>
'When your Stuffin' will be ready -- and very good: perhaps.'
<P>
Those two old Bachelors without loss of time<BR>
The nearly purpledicular crags at once began to climb;<BR>
And at the top, among the rocks, all seated in a nook,<BR>
They saw that Sage, a reading of a most enormous book.
<P>
'You earnest Sage!' aloud they cried, 'your book you've read enough in!--<BR>
'We wish to chop you into bits to mix you into Stuffin'!'--
        <P> But that old Sage looked calmly up, and with his awful book,<BR>
          At those two Bachelors' bald heads a certain aim he took;--<BR>
          and over crag and precipice they rolled promiscuous down,--<BR>
          At once they rolled, and never stopped in lane or field or town,--<BR>
          And when they reached their house, they found (besides their want<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of 
          Stuffin',)<BR>
          The Mouse had fled; -- and, previously, had eaten up the Muffin. 
        <P>
They left their home in silence by the once convivial door.<BR>
And from that hour those Bachelors were never heard of more.
