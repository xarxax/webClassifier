        <p><b><font color="#330066" size="3">Somewhere around 1980, while I was 
          still wishing for decent lesbian role models, Barbara Grier opened Naiad 
          Press and dedicated it to a readership of lesbians she knew were out 
          there--but who had never had easy access to stories by, for, and about 
          women loving women. In 1984, Naiad published two books by a then-unknown 
          author, Katherine V. Forrest. <i>Curious Wine</i> was everything young 
          women had been missing in terms of positive lesbian portrayal while 
          still acknowledging how hard it is to deal with the negative attitudes 
          of the outside world. This book alone would have been an historical 
          highlight, but Forrest didn't stop there. The same year she published 
          <i>Amateur City, </i>the first in a series of mystery novels featuring 
          ex-Marine, hard-headed cop Kate Delafield. What followed over the next 
          two decades were a number of insightful, well-written, and much-loved 
          novels and short stories.</font></b></p>
        <p><b><font color="#330066" size="3">Katherine Forrest has been a pioneer 
          to two generations of women--soon to be three--who have been hungry 
          for interesting and accurate representations of themselves and their 
          worlds. She's written romance, fantasy, short stories, mystery, erotica, 
          and coming out stories. She also spent a decade editing at Naiad Press 
          and continues to write, teach and lecture around the country. The majority 
          of her books are still in print, which is a tough feat for lesbian literature.

        </b></font>In the brutal murder of Teddie Crawford, co-owner of Tradition, 
        a trendy restaurant/catering business, presence of cocaine, multiple stab 
        wounds, and a blood-spattered crime scene initially suggest a coke party 
        gone bad, but homicide detective Kate Delafield quickly senses that this 
        answer is too simplistic. The first half of the book goes quickly as we 
        watch Kate move through the painstaking process of identifying the suspect 
        and booking him. This is more than just a police procedural, however. 
        The story also explores public attitudes toward homosexuality and the 
        paradoxical nature of a judicial system that sometimes thwarts justice. 
        A high-powered attorney takes the suspect's case and it becomes apparent 
        that he intends to persuade the jury that Crawford deserved his death 
        for attempting to force himself sexually on his straight client. Kate 
        allies herself with Linda Foster, a tough young female d.a., who takes 
        center stage for the remainder of the book. The murder trial that follows 
        is taut and at times more compelling than the police investigation that 
        preceded it. Forrest also lets us see the strains on Kate's life as she 
        pursues the case. The defense attorney knows she is a lesbian and could 
        use it against the prosecution. Kate's male partner is lazy and contemptuous 
        of gays. Her lover, Aimee, appears briefly to provide comfort, although 
        her inability to truly understand the affect of the politically explosive 
        case on her older lover is vaguely troubling. Apart from a couple of strident 
        message scenes in a lesbian bar, Murder by Tradition is suspenseful and 
        wellwritten and Forrest's realistic depiction of the uneven justice afforded 
        gays adds an important dimension to a solid story. ~Independent Publisher<br>

        </b></font>LAPD homicide detective Kate Delafield is shot in a routine 
        drug bust. It's her first line-of-fire accident, but when it turns out 
        that the bullet that winged her came not from the suspect's gun but from 
        a police weapon, the case takes on a different hue. Was Kate's injury 
        the result of a bias against gays and lesbians in the department? And 
        how does it tie into the charges levied against Luke Taggart, a cop whose 
        partner, a closeted gay man, was killed in what he believes was a hate 
        crime? When Kate is reluctantly dragooned into defending Taggart at a 
        departmental hearing on charges that could lead to a murder indictment, 
        she tries to ignore the homophobia that seems to be the common link between 
        her shooting and the murder of Taggart's partner. But the psychotherapy 
        required after an officer-involved shooting forces her to confront her 
        guilt over the suicide of another member of the department and her ambivalence 
        about outing her gay colleagues or even coming out of the closet herself. 
        Forrest uses both the current tarnish on the reputation of the Rampart-era 
        LAPD and the tangled personal and political implications of sexual diversity 
        to good advantage in this well-crafted mystery, the fifth in the Kate 
        Delafield series. The most effective scenes, in the office of the psychologist 
        she's forced to see, add another layer of complexity to Kate's character. 
        This is a heroine who continues to evolve and grow with every new adventure.

        (after 1997's Apparition Alley). The usually cool Delafield, an LAPD detective, 
        is unnerved when she and her new partner, rookie Joe Cameron, are called 
        in to examine the body of well-known anthropologist Herman Layton, who 
        has turned up dead at the famous La Brea Tar Pits with a puncture wound 
        near his kidney. When Delafield and Cameron notify the victim's next of

        paleoanthropologist, whose career promises to surpass that of her mentors, 
        the infamous Leakey family. The case takes an unusual turn after the discovery 
        of a jawbone that resembles that of the two-million-year-old Peking Man, 
        whose remains were lost nearly 30 years ago. Later, Delafield and Cameron 
        learn of Herman Layton's involvement in the U.S. government's covert attempt 
        to move the Peking Man from China for safekeeping after the Japanese invasion 
        of WWII, an episode that left the adventurous anthropologist ostracized 
        by his colleagues. The link between Peking Man and Layton's murder seems

        </b></font>When Carolyn, the young wife of an ambitious executive, begins 
        to awaken to the emptiness of her life, it is not long before the conflict 
        starts. Her husband Paul is a textbook case of pathological chauvinism: 
        he rigidly controls his wife's style of dress, job opportunities, contact 
        with friends; and he uses the title &quot;princess&quot; to both exalt 
        and ensnare her. The final showdown is precipitated by Carolyn's growing 
        friendship with Val, an imposingly tall and sharp-witted visual artist 
        who lives in the bungalow next door with her adolescent son. The novel 
        offers many of the classic fantasy scenarios spawned by the early women's 
        movement, from intellectual sparring between the neanderthal husband and 
        the progressive, independent woman to a blushing yet lusty first sexual 
        encounter between the two women. In her narrative, Forrest provides each

        more than simply a metaphor for misogyny. The author understands and describes 
        the feelings of inadequacy and fear that are at the root of male supremacy

        Pete Wilson's threatened veto of the gay civil rights bill. A charismatic 
        woman named Donnelly sends out a clarion call to a small circle of friends 
        and ex-lovers, who gather together in Pat's remote mountain cabin. Aside 
        from the collective indignation over the veto, the reasons for this gathering 
        are much more personal than political. In fact, it becomes a neat literary 
        device whereby these friends can bring into the open their past fears, 
        doubts, and jealousies to heal old wounds. Bradley slowly comes to terms 
        with the breakup of his early marriage to Donnelly, while Pat mulls over 
        her loss of Donnelly to flashy golf pro Averill. Forrest (Curious Wine, 
        Naiad Pr., 1993. reprint) skillfully uses flashbacks to lay bare the innermost 
        feelings of her characters-who, for the most part, are imperfect and believable. 
        Since Flashpoint tethers itself to certain political events, it will become 
        dated over time-but solely on this basis. On many other levels, this is 
        a satisfying and thought-provoking book that will enhance Forrest's reputation.

        be, can they withstand the savagery of a man who uses their own secrets 
        against them? Just as she did 18 years ago, Katherine Forrest has created 
        a brilliant and breathtaking saga of a divided society and the rebels 
        courageous enough to withstand this brutal new world.</p>

      </font></b>Late in the twenty-second century, 4,000 women escape the tyranny 
      of a male-dominated Earth and colonize the planet of Maternas. Katherine 
      V. Forrest's influential 1984 novel, Daughters of a Coral Dawn, told the 
      story of this exodus. Her 2000 novel, Daughters of an Amber Noon, told the 
      story of the women left behind on Earth. Now she returns to Maternas at 
      last. Fifty years have passed, and the first generation born on Maternas 
      has reached maturity. But their vision of a perfect world is very different 
      from the vision of the founders of the Maternas colony.
