		<div>Food BlockChain - 2018</div>
		<div>View Next Story</div>
		<div>We are always innovating ways to make your company stronger, more profitable, and more efficient.  We believe that the BlockChain concepts on which cryptocurrencies are based will tremendously help food chain traceability to assist in recalls and also to help chefs and restaurant patrons learn more about what is on the plate. 

We are running pilot tests and we’ll be leading the industry forward.</div>
		<div>Complex Pricing/Chain Reporting</div>
		<div>Our customers are typically in the $5 to $50 million/year range; some larger, some smaller.   Most come to us after years of struggling with inefficient systems built on Quickbooks, Excel, pencil & paper, and sticky notes.   We help them get organized and make the most of their resources; in turn, they grow rapidly and get much more profitable.</div>
		<div>Lot Tracking
</div>
		<div>We’ve seen it all and can help you get where you need to be:

		<div>Freight Consolidation

		<div>Multiple Warehouses

		<div>Web Site Development

We use state of the art tools to develop web sites that will attract and retain valuable customers. Our web sites look great on all platforms from iPhones to Macs.</div>
		<div>Regular Updates

Every month or two, we release a new version. The new features and feature changes are usually the result of customer requests and our research and development. Updates are optional; if you would like to stay on your current version, you are more than welcome.</div>
		<div>24/7 Support

We work when you work, it's that simple. If you have an issue at 3am on a Sunday, just call and we'll resolve it right away. Thankfully, due to excellent software design and programming, issues are few and far between.</div>
		<div>Custom Programming

If you can imagine it, we can build it. We have written thousands of add-ons for most every conceivable purpose. Just give us a call and we'll give you a quote.</div>
		<div>Data Conversion

EIC will convert data from any software and from any platform. A standard data conversion includes Customers, Vendors, Inventory, GL Accounts, and their starting balances; an advanced data conversion can be designed to convert any and all data.</div>

		<div>Server
</div>
		<div>We like your business to be up and running 100% of the time.   The only way to guarantee that is if the server is located inside your building and to not rely on the Internet being up to run your business.   Most of our customers have very short windows where they take orders up until 10pm and then process and pick orders until 5am and then ship out the trucks right after that.    It is a delicate dance and restaurants will not accept “our internet was down” for the reason their order didn’t arrive.

		<div>The ideal solution would have two ESXi servers on site on different ends of the building. The second one would be used as a hot spare.

We recommend the HP Proliant G8 line of servers - the ML350 with dual processors is our standard "go to" machine for a typical 30 user install.



WorkstationsAll workstations do in the EIC environment is open a window into the user's Windows 2008 R2 Server desktop
PCWe recommend Windows 8.1 using Microsoft Terminal Client / RDPMicrosoft Terminal Client RDP also works will with older Windows XP and Windows 7 machines
MacWe recommend using the Cord Remote Desktop programWe have some accounts that use Macbooks or iMacs on every desk. It is a very nice environment and we recommend it as it provides better up-time and better virus protection than the PC environment
Dumb TerminalWe recommend the Wyse line of terminals - these should be configured to access the Windows 2008 R2 server via RDP. Very good solution for a low cost, zero maintenance client


RF ScannersWe recommend the Motorola/Symbol MC90XX line of Windows Mobile Handheld ComputersWorks well in a freezer environment down to -10 degrees with the heated version of these units
Label PrintersFor warehouse picking labels, we recommend the SATO 8400rv line of printers with a wired or wifi interfaceFor production batch labels, we recommend the Datamax i-4208 line of printers with a wired or wifi interface
ScalesWe recommend the Rice Lake brand of scales.EIC is a re-seller of their scales - we can get you a great price and also configure them for your environmentTypically we recommend the CW-90 checkweigher with a 100lb 12" x 12" bench scale and a Wifi interface- this is great for most warehouse catch weight environments. If it is a wash-down environment, then we recommend the CW-90X checkweigher with the IP69K rating.
Office Printers / Document ScannersWe recommend the Xerox ColorCube 920X line of office machines.The scanner can easily be set up for one touch scanning of signed-delivered invoices that come back from the routes. A few minutes after scanning, they are linked to the invoice in the accounting system and all users can easily retrieve copies of the signed invoices.Scanners should be capable of being configured to do PDF -> SMB (samba)
NetworkVPNWe typically set up the CentOS virtual machine as an internet firewall / gateway / PPTP VPN serverWith proper credentials, system users can easily access their EIC desktop from home or on the roadWiredWe like to see all CAT6 wiring with an HP Procurve switch for handling the trafficThe wired part of the network is not as important in the EIC solution because almost all of the traffic is handled inside the ESXi server - Wifi only networks can be done just fineWirelessWe like to see full warehouse/freezer coverage with the Motorola/Symbol brand of access points</div>
