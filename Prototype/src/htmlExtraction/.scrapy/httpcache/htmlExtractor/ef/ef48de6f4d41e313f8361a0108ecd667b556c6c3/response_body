<P><B>Considered by many to be America&#146;s finest author, Jack
London, whose name at birth was John Griffith Chaney, was born
&#147;south of the slot&#148;&#151;an area south of Market Street
and its cable lines in San Francisco, California, on January 12,
1876. The California Historical Society <IMG SRC="jlbirthsfsmall.jpg"
WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="132" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0">has placed a
plaque, attached to a former Wells Fargo Building at Third and
Brannan Streets, at what was formerly 615 Third Street, a home
destroyed by the famous April 18, 1906 fire that accompanied the
great quake. This plaque states that it &#147;marks the birthplace
of the noted author Jack London . . .&#148; The plaque marks the
location of the home of the Slocums, friends of Flora, Jack&#146;s
mother, where it has been said she was living after her reported
suicide attempt and release from Dr. Ruttley&#146;s (which was
on Mission Street). Jack&#146;s birth certificate does not indicate
where he was born, so although we cannot verify this as the actual
birthplace of Jack London, at the time, most children were born
at home, so this is feasible.<BR>
</B></P>

<P><B>It is believed that he is the biological son of William
Chaney, an itinerant astrologer and journalist, who &#147;married&#148;
then deserted Jack&#146;s mother, Flora, a spiritualist, before
he was born. Flora married John London, a Civil War veteran who
had recently moved to San Francisco, eight months after Jack was
born. Jack did not learn the true circumstances of his birth until
he was in his early twenties. Much of his youth was spent in Oakland,
California, on the waterfront.</B><IMG SRC="JLreading.jpeg" WIDTH="195"
HEIGHT="169" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0"></P>

<P><B>Jack had little formal schooling. Initially, he attended
school only through the 8th grade, although he was an avid reader,
educating himself at public libraries, especially the Oakland
Public Library under the tutelage of Ina Coolbrith, who later
became the first poet laureate of California. In later years (mid-1890s),
Jack returned to high school in Oakland and graduated. He eventually
gained admittance to U.C. Berkeley, but stayed only for six months,
finding it to be &#147;not alive enough&#148; and a &#147;passionless
pursuit of passionless intelligence&#148;.</B></P>

<P><B>Jack&#146;s extensive life experiences included: being a
laborer, factory worker, oyster pirate on the San Francisco Bay,
member of the California Fish Patrol, sailor, able-bodied seaman,
railroad hobo, and gold prospector (in the Klondike from 1897-1898).
In his teens, he joined Coxey&#146;s Army in its famous march
on Washington, D.C., and was later arrested for vagrancy in Erie
County, New York. As a journalist, Jack covered the Russo-Japanese
War for the Hearst newspapers in 1904, and in 1914, he covered
the Mexican Revolution for <I>Collier&#146;s</I>.</B></P>

<P><B>It was during his cross-country travels that he became acquainted
with socialism, which for many years, became his &#147;holy grail&#148;.
He became known as the &#147;Boy Socialist of Oakland&#148; because
of his passionate street corner oratory. In fact, he unsuccessfully
ran for mayor of Oakland several times as the socialist party
candidate.</B></P>

<P><B>In 1900, Jack married his math tutor and friend, Bess Maddern.
It was a Victorian marriage typical of the time, based on &#147;good
breeding&#148;, not love. With Bess, he had two daughters &#151;
Joan and Bess (&#147;Becky&#148;). Following his separation from
Bess in 1903, he married his secretary, Charmian Kittredge, whom
he considered his &#147;Mate Woman&#148; and with whom he found
true love. Together, they played, traveled, wrote and enjoyed
life. Their one child, Joy, only lived for thirty-eight hours.</B></P>

<P><B>In 1907, with his second wife, Charmian, Jack sailed the
Pacific to the South Seas in the <I>Snark</I>, which became the
basis for his book, <U>The Cruise of the Snark</U>. With Charmian
at his side, he also developed his &#147;Beauty Ranch&#148; on
1,400 acres of land in Glen Ellen, California.</B></P>

<P><B>By his death at age forty on November 22, 1916, Jack had
been plagued for years by a vast number of health problems, including
stomach disturbances, ravaging uremia, and failing kidneys. His
death certificate states that he died of uremic poisoning.</B></P>

<P><B>Jack was among the most publicized figures of his day. In
his lectures, he endorsed socialism and women&#146;s suffrage.
He was also one of the first celebrities used to endorse commercial
products, such as grape juice and men&#146;s suits.</B></P>

<P><B>Young Jack London&#146;s exceptional brightness and his
optimistic, buoyant personality eventually combined to transform
his many experiences into a working philosophy of service and
survival. He became the personification for his readers of many
of the virtues and ideals of a turn-of-the-century Western American
man and was the country&#146;s first successful working class
writer.</B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="+3">Jack London . . . The Writer</FONT></B></P>

<P><B>Once Ja<IMG SRC="JLwritingoutdoors.jpeg" WIDTH="176" HEIGHT="141"
ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0">ck had resolved himself to succeed as
an author, his diligent habits and innate skills catapulted him
far beyond most of his literary peers in both perspective and
content. By following a strict writing regimen of 1,000 words
a day, he was able to produce a huge quantity of high quality
work over a period of eighteen years.</B></P>

<P><B>Jack had become the best-selling, highest paid and most
popular American author of his time. He was prolific: fifty-one
of his books and hundreds of his articles had been published.
He had written thousands of letters. Many additional works have
been published posthumously. His most notable books include <U>The
Call of the Wild</U> (originally entitled &#147;The Sleeping Wolf&#148;)
which was published in 1903, <U>The Iron Heel</U>, <U>White Fang</U>,
<U>The Sea-Wolf</U> (originally entitled &#147;Mercy of the Sea&#148;),
<U>The People of the Abyss</U> (a sociological treatise about
the slums of London, England), <U>John Barleycorn</U>, <U>Martin
Eden</U>, and <U>The Star Rover</U>. His short story, &#147;To
Build A Fire&#148;, is considered to be an all-time classic. His
writings have been translated in several dozen languages and to
this day continue to be widely read throughout the world.</B></P>

<P><B>This American literary genius brilliantly and compassionately
portrayed his life and times, as well as the neverending struggles
of man and nature. Millions of avid readers have been thrilled
by his stories of adventure. Authors and social advocates have
been inspired by his heartfelt prose. Nevertheless, many of his
life experiences were more exciting than his fiction.</B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="+3">Jack London . . . The Sailor</FONT></B></P>

<P><B>No man has ever loved to sail more than Jack London. Even
as a very young boy, fishing with his stepfather in small boats,
his head would fill with visions of tropical islands and faraway
places. As he grew up, he <IMG SRC="JLonRoamerintro.jpeg" WIDTH="187"
HEIGHT="177" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0">occasionally rented boats
with money earned from his many part-time jobs. At fifteen, with
the financial assistance of &#147;Aunt Jenny&#148; Prentiss, Jack
bought a sloop, the <I>Razzle Dazzle</I>, in order to escape the
life of the &#147;work beast&#148;. He became an illegal oyster
pirate, and before long, had earned the title of &#147;Prince
of the Oyster Pirates&#148;; he made more money in one week than
he was able to earn in his first full year as a professional writer.
Realizing that the life of an oyster pirate frequently ended in
prison or death, he reformed and became a California Fish Patrol
deputy.</B></P>

<P><B>During his lifetime, Jack sailed on a variety of ships including:
the sealing schooner <I>Sophia Sutherland</I> to Japan (on which
he served as an able-bodied seaman); on the steamship SS <I>Umatilla</I>
and the <I>City of Topeka</I> (to Alaska); the RMS <I>Majestic</I>
(to England); the SS <I>Siberia</I> (as correspondent during the
Russo-Japanese War); took a sampan to Korea; bought and sailed
the <I>Spray</I>; designed, built, and sailed the <I>Snark</I>
[named after the humoresque Lewis Carroll story] to Hawaii and
the South Seas; returned from Tahiti to San Francisco on the SS
<I>Mariposa</I>; sailed on the ketch <I>Minota</I> near Tahiti;
sailed from Australia to Ecuador on the <I>Tymeric</I>; cruised
on the San Francisco Bay and environs in the <I>Roamer</I>; sailed
from Seattle to California on the <I>City</I> <I>of Pueblo</I>;
sailed on the <I>Dirigo </I>from New York to San Francisco by
way of Cape Horn; took the US Army transport <I>Kilpatrick</I>
to Mexico (to write about the Mexican Revolution); sailed on fishing
boats; stayed on a houseboat; visited the hospital ship USS <I>Solace</I>,
the repair ship USS <I>Vestal</I>, and the battleships <I>New
York, Arkansas, </I>and<I> Mississippi</I>; returned to Galveston
on the transport <I>Ossabow</I>; sailed to Hawaii on the <I>Matsonia</I>;
and returned to California on the SS <I>Sonoma</I>.</B></P>

<P><B><IMG SRC="JLinKlondikegarb.jpeg%20" WIDTH="98" HEIGHT="271"
ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0">Overcome with &#147;Klondike fever,&#148;
Jack departed from San Francisco on the SS <I>Umatilla</I> on
July 25, 1897, accompanied and bankrolled by his much older brother-in-law,
Captain Shepard, who returned home after only two days on the
rugged Alaska trails. With nearly 2,000 pounds of required equipment
&#151; including warm garments, food, mining implements, tents,
blankets, Klondike stoves, and a copy of Miner Bruce&#146;s <U>Alaska</U>,
Jack entered the Yukon Territory by way of the Dyea River and
the notorious Chilkoot Pass.</B></P>

<P><B>Jack moved into a cabin and staked a claim on Henderson
Creek in early November of 1897, after a month of prospecting.
During the long winter which followed, he became well-known to
his fellow prospectors for his storytelling ability.</B></P>

<P><B>In May 1898, he developed a severe case of scurvy from lack
of fresh fruit and vegetables; he could no longer work his claim.
Desperately needing immediate medical attention, he anxiously
awaited the melting of the ice blocking the Yukon River. He eventually
did receive some medical help but was advised to return home.
On June 28, he arrived in St. Michael, after making his way in
a small boat down 1,500 miles of the Yukon River. From St. Michael,
he sailed home.</B></P>

<P><B>Jack London gained a tremendous amount of insight and perspective
while in Alaska and the Klondike [in Canada]. Although he had
not discovered much gold, he had uncovered a Mother Lode of experience
from which he would draw material for his future novels and stories.</B></P>

<P><B>Upon his return to Oakland, California, he discovered that
his stepfather, John London, had died. At the age of 22, he now
shouldered the responsibility of supporting his mother and his
stepnephew. Despite tackling every job opening possible, he could
not find steady work. In desperation, he sold many of his belongings
and dove into writing. He was talented and prolific, yet at first
all of his manuscripts were rejected. In early December 1898,
he sold his first short story, an Alaskan tale entitled, &#147;To
The Man On Trail&#148;. His writing career was launched.</B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="+3">Jack London . . . the Rancher</FONT></B></P>

<P><CENTER><B>&#147;I ride over my beautiful ranch. Betwen my
legs is a beautiful horse. <BR>
The air is wine. The grapes on a score of rolling hills are red
with autumn flame. <BR>
Across Sonoma Mountain, wisps of sea fog are stealing. <BR>
The afternoon sun smolders in the drowsy sky. <BR>
I have everything to make me glad I am alive.&#148;</B></CENTER></P>

<P><B>In 1905, while living with Charmian at Wake Robin Lodge
in Glen Ellen, California, Jack London decided to settle permanently
in the Valley of the Moon. In June, he purchased his first piece
of real estate &#151; the Hill Ranch &#151; 130 beautiful acres
of trees, fields, springs, streams, canyons, hills, and abundant
wildl<IMG SRC="JLforweb.jpeg" WIDTH="115" HEIGHT="143" ALIGN="LEFT"
BORDER="0">ife. After six additional land purchases, Jack London&#146;s
&#147;Beauty Ranch&#148; eventually totaled 1,400 acres and consisted
of seven parcels of land bought between 1905 and 1913.</B></P>

<P><B>Jack loved ranch life. At Beauty Ranch, he raised many animals
such as prize bulls, horses, and pigs. He cultivated a wide variety
of crops, including forty acres of wine grapes which were formerly
part of the Kohler-Frohling Winery. By damming a stream that crossed
the property, Jack built a lake for irrigation and recreation.
He introduced terracing and green water mulching. He produced
record yields of oat hay on acreage that had been considered overfarmed.
He experimented with innovative ideas such as growing spineless
cactus, which was developed by his friend, the &#147;Plant Wizard&#148;,
Luther Burbank (who lived in nearby Santa Rosa), for use as a
cattle feed in arid regions; unfortunately, the cactus was not
completely spineless and could not be used for feed. He imported
thousands of Australian eucalyptus trees hoping the wood could
be used for hardwood lumber and pier pilings, but the wood was
found to be too soft. Jack&#146;s &#147;Pig Palace&#148; was the
showplace of the county. It allowed one man to feed up to two
hundred hogs; Jack normally employed two men to feed and care
for his pigs. And, his ranch&#146;s concrete silos were the very
first in California.</B></P>

<P><B>The ranch was also the building site for the majestic Wolf
House. Constructed completely with native redwood trees, locally-quarried
boulders, volcanic rock and blue slate, Wolf House took more than
two years to build. Only a few days before Jack and Charmian were
to move in, the house tragically burned due to spontaneous combustion
caused by a careless oversight by a workman; only the walls were
left standing.</B></P>

<P><B>You can visit and enjoy Jack London&#146;s Beauty Ranch
today. It is now a California State Historic Park which includes
the House of Happy Walls museum, the Pig Palace, Jack London&#146;s
grave, the Lake, the Wolf House ruins, and more.<BR>
