<blockquote><h3>Testimonial - Retirement Time!</h3>
<br><p>
Dear Jon & IH Staff,

<br><br>     Please do not renew my subscription to IHcom.  The time has finally
come for me to end my stock investing and simply retire to enjoy the
benefits of the effort I have made during the last 14 years with you.  I am
soon to be 66 years old.  I no longer have enough energy for the time and
attention it takes to have individual stock investments work out.
<br><br>     My priorities have changed.  I retired 7 years ago at age 59.  I find
myself just as busy during retirement, just doing different things.  Wise
investment has left me financially secure.  I have no fear of being unable
to fully enjoy the satisfying life these autumn years bring.  Thank you for
your positive influence in achieving this goal.  Freedom from financial
insecurity is a wonderful thing.

<br><br>     I certainly enjoyed Jon's Market Commentary.  I looked forward to
reading it every day.  It's funny how I seem to have no time for it anymore.
"Chuckle"     ...I am preparing to move back to the Lower 48 States from my
beloved Alaska.  I will meet up with my buddies who have already moved back
to MN and CO.  We will continue to fish year round and hunt upland game
birds in the Fall.  We have the goal of visiting all of our Nation's
beautiful National Parks.  We  are very busy simply enjoying each other's
company.  ...Life is good.  Thanks, again, for helping make it all possible.

<br><br>     Sincerely,
<br>     Jim Holo, Anchorage, AK
<br>
