      <B>RUDYARD KIPLING AND MUSIC. </B>
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936) was the bard of [the British] Empire in all its
      manifestations. As he was born in India it is natural that many of his writings,
      poetry or prose, feature the sub-continent, but others recall the men, soldiers,
      sailors and so on, which bound the Empire together and <I>If</I>, apparently
      once set to music by <B>Bantock</B>, personifies the "stiff upper-lip" which
      built the Empire. This is not to say that Kipling was jingoistic. His poem
      <I>Recessional</I> appears indeed to foretell the decline of Empire. Both
      <B>Sullivan</B> and <B>Elgar</B> considered setting this to music, although
      neither got round to doing so (1); one may think, however, that
      <B>Elgar</B>'s Second Symphony catches its spirit faithfully enough.
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      Many composers, <B>Sullivan</B> and <B>Elgar</B> included, set Kipling's
      words but we start this doubtless incomplete, fragmentary even, survey of
      music inspired by Kipling with the incidental music written for screen
      adaptations of his prose works. Curiously, perhaps, nearly all of them were
      American and most of these had scores composed by some of the all-time greats
      among Hollywood's music moguls: <I>Captains Courageous </I>(1937: <B>Franz
      Waxman</B>), <I>Wee Willie Winkie </I>(1937: <B>Alfred Newman</B>), <I>Gunga
      Din </I>(1939: <B>Newman </B>again), <I>The Light That Failed </I>(1939:
      <B>Victor Young</B>), <I>The Jungle Book </I>(1942: <B>Miklos Rozsa</B>),
      <I>Kim </I>(1950: <B>Andre Previn</B>), <I>Soldiers Three </I>(1951: <B>Adolph
      Deutsch</B>) and <I>The Man Who Would Be King </I>(1975: <B>Maurice Jarre</B>).
      The only British Kipling feature film in the post "silent" era was <I>Elephant
      Boy </I>(1937) which had music by <B>John Greenwood </B>(1889-1975). Better-known
      than any of these, both as a film and for its music, was the 1967 cartoon
      version of <I>The Jungle Book</I>, whose music and lyrics were by the brothers
      <B>Richard and Robert Sherman</B>, associated with so many of the latterday
      Disney cartoon films, although perhaps the film's best known song, <I>The
      Bare Necessities</I> had music and lyrics by <B>Terry Gilkyson</B>. <B>Basil
      Poledouris </B>did the musical honours for the 1994 television adaptation.
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      Many British, let alone other, composers were not drawn to Kipling. Most
      of these who are by common consent among the greats of 20th Century British
      songwriters - Gurney, Warlock, Ireland, <B>Vaughan Williams </B>(apart from
      the section <I>Land of our Birth </I>from his <I>Thanksgiving for Victory
      </I>of 1946) and Britten, among others knew him not.
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      We have already alluded to Sullivan - and Elgar and the fact that neither
      set Kipling's <I>Recessional </I>(2), but both collaborated with Kipling,
      an undoubted patriot, in time of war. When the Boer War of 1899-1902 broke
      out, Kipling's newly written poem <I>The Absent Minded Beggar </I>became
      immediately popular and Sullivan's setting of its words - no easy task, as
      he admitted - enhanced this popularity from its premiere at the Alhambra
      Theatre in 13 November 1899. 75,000 copies were printed (at the publishers'
      expense) and all proceeds from their sale went to wives and children of soldiers
      and sailors in active service. For his part in this Sullivan received as
      many sneers from people in the musical establishment, who should have known
      better, as he had done for years and was later, for having written the Savoy
      operas. Such comments need not concern us in this 21st Century when <I>The
      Absent Minded Beggar </I>may incidentally still be heard.
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      Eighteen years later Admiral Charles Beresford approached <B>Elgar </B>with
      a request that he set to music four Kipling poems entitled <I>The Fringes
      of the Fleet. </I>Kipling, grieving for his missing soldier son, was lukewarm
      about the idea, but Elgar, who later described his settings as being in a
      "broad salt water style", was enthusiastic. Four baritone singers, led by
      Charles Mott, premiered them at the Coliseum on 11 June 1917. A London "run"
      of these songs, plus another Elgar setting of words by Sir Gilbert Parker,
      was followed by a long and popular progress through provincial theatres,
      ending back at the Coliseum in December. The songs were recorded, also in
      1917, by the original singers; two of them, <I>Fate's Discourtesy </I>and
      <I>The Sweepers</I>, were recorded in "electric" days by Keith Falkner and
      the whole cycle has been similarly treated in more recent times (3).
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      It is surely no accident that Kipling should have been set by two men who
      were successively, if largely unofficially, Britain's "laureate" composers.
      (It is also instructive that Sullivan, Elgar and Kipling were all at various
      times looked down upon by the respective musical and literary "establishments").
      Many of the other settings of Kipling that were made, and especially the
      better known ones, were by composers who, rightly or wrongly, acquired the
      piegeon-hole "light music composer" (again both Sullivan and Elgar were this,
      in part). <B>Edward German</B>'s lively baritone song <I>Rolling Down to
      Rio </I>may still be heard; years ago I was delighted to make the acquaintance
      of several other of the twelve settings collectively entitled <I>Just So
      Song Book </I>(many of the lyrics come from <I>Just So Stories</I>, beloved
      of several generations of children, including mine). <I>A Smuggler's Song
      </I>received choral settings by <B>Christopher le Fleming </B>(1908-1985)
      (unison and two-part voices), <B>Paul Edmonds</B>, <B>Michael Mullinar
      </B>(1895-1973) (unison) and the 1920s Doncaster organist and choirmaster
      <B>Arnold Williams </B>(SATB).
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      <B>Percy Grainger </B>(1882-1961), not a composer one would immediately link
      with Kipling, embraced his cause enthusiastically and made around twenty
      settings of him, as the fascinatingly entitled <I>The Beaches of Lukannon:
      Song of the Seal Rookeries, Aleutian Islands</I>, laid out for mixed voice
      chorus and nine or more strings and harmonium <I>ad lib </I>appeared in 1958
      (though composed, as was usual with Grainger, much earlier) was described
      as "Kipling Settings No.20". Some of Grainger's settings, like
      <I>Dedication</I>, <I>The Love Song of Har Dyal</I>, <I>The Man of the Sea
      </I>and <I>The Only Son </I>were for solo voice, but perhaps a majority,
      such as <I>Morning Song in the Jungle </I>(male voices), <I>Recessional</I>
      (mixed voices), <I>Red Dog </I>(male voices), <I>Soldier, Soldier </I>(six
      solo voices and chorus), <I>The Fall of the Stone</I>, <I>The Sea Wife</I>,
      <I>The Widow's Party</I>, <I>We Have Fed Our Seas </I>and <I>Tiger, Tiger</I>,
      are for a variety of choral ensembles and, often, accompanying instruments.
      Grainger undoubtedly immeasurably enriches the Kipling musical portofolio.
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      Other choral settings included <B>Lee Hoiby</B>'s <I>Song of the Galley Slaves
      </I>Op.14 No.3 for four part male choir and timpani (1958), <B>Josef
      Holbrooke</B>'s <I>Hymn Before Action </I>Op.113c for SATB, <B>Armstrong
      Gibbs</B>' <I>Tiger, Tiger </I>(TTBB) and <I>The Love Song of Har Dyal</I>,
      for two sopranos and piano accompaniment (1966) by <B>Anthony Scott</B>.
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      Kipling's words supplied lyrics for Edwardian (and post-Edwardian) balladry.
      We may cite <I>The Drums of the Fore and Aft </I>by <B>James Molloy
      </B>(1837-1909), quite popular in its day, while <B>Gerard Cobb</B>, around
      1900, set all twenty of the <I>Barrack Room Ballads</I>. A few years ago,
      Ralph Mearley recorded <I>Fuzzy Wuzzy</I>, <I>Tommy</I>, <I>Danny Deever
      </I>(memorably set by Grainger also) (4), <I>The Young British Soldier </I>and
      <I>On the Road to Mandalay </I>and very good they are. The best-known setting
      of the latter was of course by the American <B>Oley Speaks </B>(another was
      by <B>Walter Hedgecock </B>[d. 1932], Musical Director at the Crystal Palace)
      and another Kipling ballad, very popular in its day, was <I>Boots</I>, by
      <B>J.P. McCall</B>, otherwise the outstanding Australian bass-baritone <B>Peter
      Dawson </B>(1882-1961) and this was not, by any means, the only McCall/Kipling
      song, though only <I>Boots</I> may still be heard nowadays. <B>Dora Bright
      </B>(1863-1951) published a set of six songs from <I>The Jungle Book</I>,
      including <I>Tiger, Tiger</I>. Kipling even appeared in musical comedy when
      <I>The Drums of the Fore and Aft </I>was included as a drum feature in <I>The
      Antelope </I>(1908), whose music was by the Austrian-born <B>Hugo Felix </B>-
      but the show, briefly staged at the Waldorf, failed.
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      Kipling's reputation has been in decline - along with that of the British
      Empire which he illustrated so faithfully - since he died, in the same month
      as King George V, in 1936. In my undergraduate years I remember G.M. Trevelyan,
      in his Cambridge lectures of 1953, <I>A Layman's Love of Letters</I>, making
      an urgent plea for him but despite that - perhaps because of it - his reputation
      has hardly seen an upturn in the years since then. One's experience in musical
      settings of Kipling tends to run parallel with this, for all the charm of
      the settings by Edward German and others and despite the brilliant special
      pleading of the admittedly maverick Percy Grainger, they in general do not
      have the prestige of those by, for example, Hardy or Housman. Many of them
      have the status of either occasional music or light music, which many observers
      look down on as lower forms of life. Few have appeared in the past generation
      or so (5). At least a number of them were by non-British composers. And at
      least the American Kipling films used the best musical talents Hollywood
      could call on at the relevant times. Is it too late for our best composers
      to help reinstate Kipling? Given the present guilt-laden attitude to British
      imperialism I fear it may be.

      <I><B>Philip L. Scowcroft</B> </I>- March 2001
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      (1) One of the few that did apart from Percy Grainger, as we shall see, was
      the American composer Reginald de Koven, best remembered for an opera on
      <I>Robin Hood </I>and specifically the one song <I>O promise Me </I>- long
      popular at weddings - from it.
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      (2) <B>Josef Holbrooke </B>was another composer who contemplated, but did
      not complete, a large-scale setting of Kipling.
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      (3) Elgar also set to music Kipling's <I>Big Steamers </I>in 1918 as a short
      song.
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      (4) <I>Danny Deever</I>, in a version for baritone, male voice chorus and
      orchestra, is a movement from the Third Symphony of the Soviet composer
      <B>Lokshin </B>(performed, incidentally, in England in the 1980s under Gennadi
      Rozhdestvensky's baton). Another setting of <I>Danny Deever </I>came from
      <B>Walter Damrosch </B>(1862-1950), German-born American-domiciled conductor
      and composer.
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      (5) The only solo song to Kipling's words that I have found from the last
      thirty years is <I>The Wishing Cups</I>, published in 1971, by the obscure
      composer <B>Gordon Binkerd</B>.
