<P>Welcome to the first website to deal exclusively with the life and works of Robert Bloch.  </P>

<P> Robert Bloch wrote more than 200 stories (mostly fantasy, horror, and science fiction, but also mystery and crime), as well as 22 novels and a large number of non-fiction articles. He was also very active in Hollywood, penning a large number of teleplays and screenplays. He is best known to the general public for his novel "Psycho," which became the basis for Alfred Hitchcock's film of the <A HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Psycho+(1960)">same name</A>.  Bloch is regarded as one of the seminal authors of twentieth century fantastic literature, a successor to Poe and Lovecraft (by way of James M. Cain), but with a voice entirely his own.</P>

While comfortable with writing about the exploits of ghouls, serial killers, and monsters of all varieties, Bloch was also one of the most pleasant and generous members of the writing community.  A fan himself, he always replied to the letters of his fans, answering their questions and encouraging their talents.
<p>
This site is designed to give the both the casual reader and the scholar of fantastic literature a general introduction to Robert Bloch and his works.  The goals of this site are to encourage the reading and the study of the works of Robert Bloch, and to get Bloch's works back in print (and keep them there). <p>

Please feel free to peruse this site, and email me with any questions or comments you might have.  This site is still under construction, and will probably be so for some time. <p>
