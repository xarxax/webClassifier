404 error!?!?<br><br>Hmmmmm...<br><br>
Well, it seems as though this page doesn't exist.
Are you sure this page isn't just in your mind?<br>No?  well, then, read below</p>
<ul style="font: 12pt arial;">
<li>Make sure the URL is correct.<br>
If so, try hitting refresh...sometimes a slow or bad connection can cause pages to not load even though
they do exist</li>
<li>If you're trying to access a subdomain or individual file, go to the <a href="http://www.animesekai.net">main site</a> and use the links to get to the correct page.</li>
<li>If you're <i>really</i> sure that you have the correct URL but the page isnt showing up, contact website @ animesekai.net</li>
<li>If none of this works, I just dont know what to tell you</li></ul>
