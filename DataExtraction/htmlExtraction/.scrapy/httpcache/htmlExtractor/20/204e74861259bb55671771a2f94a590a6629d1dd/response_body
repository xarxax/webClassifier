Allen Ginsberg's FBI file
</font></b>
<p>
<font color=brown>from 
Herbert Mitgang, <i>Dangerous dossiers : exposing the secret war against
America's greatest authors</i>
(New York : D.I. Fine, 1988)</font></font>
<p>

<blockquote>
	Allen Ginsberg, poet, social activist and member of the American
Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, also engaged the attention of
the FBI recordkeepers. "I have a stack of documents three feet high," the
. . .  poet said, and showed me a sampling of them. He has devoted much of
his time to challenging the government on issues of privacy and personal
freedom - including sexual preference - and arousing his fellow writers to
campaign for freedom of expression. <p>

	Ginsberg recently told me that Pacifica Radio, the group of radio
stations that airs public events, contemporary verse, drama and other
literature, may no longer broadcast much of his poetry, including the well
known <i>Howl</i> and <i>Kaddish</i>. Under the Reagan administration's
policy of
destroying the power to regulate of the regulatory agencies, the weakened
Federal Communications Commission has carried out Attorney General Meese's
diktat against "obscenity" and "indecency." The final report of the Meese
Commission on Pornography is a legacy for book censors and book burners
that could affect authors, editors and elements of the publishing
community for a long time to come. 
<p>     

	Ginsberg said that some of the papers in his file come from
related customs and Treasury Department investigative bureaus. His file
crisscrosses those of other writers. "They include Leroi Jones, who was
the victim of much more attack than people understand and, in that
context, his anger is understandable," Ginsberg said. "Most people don't
realize what he and other black literati have been through, assuming that
all past injustices have been redressed or somehow disappeared out of
mind. The waste remains, the waste remains and kills. The section on Tom
Hayden in Newark intersects with Jones, since Jones was influenced by an
FBI misinformation campaign to denounce Hayden as an [FBI] agent and drive
him out of Newark. The section on Black United Front and Ann Arbor
intersects with John Sinclair, poet director of Detroit Artists Workshop,
a multiracial press that is one of my publishers."
<p>     
	
	Commenting on the FBI's activities in the literary political
arena, Ginsberg said, "Why did the FBI lay off the Mafia and instead bust
the alternative media, scapegoating Leroi Jones, ganging up on Jane Fonda,
Tom Hayden, Martin Luther King, Jr., antiwar hero David Dellinger, even
putting me on a 'Dangerous Subversive' Internal Security list in 1965 - the
same year I was kicked out of Havana and Prague for talking and chanting
back to the Communist police? 'The fox condemns the trap, not himself,' as
Blake wrote in Proverbs in Hell. "
<p>     

	In a memorandum from Hoover to the Secret Service in 1965,
Ginsberg was cited as an "Internal Security--Cuba" case, and a potential
threat to the president of the United States. On the document, stamped
Secret, Ginsberg was listed as "potentially dangerous" and a "subversive,"
with "evidence of emotional instability (including unstable residence and
employment record) or irrational or suicidal behavior," as having made
"expressions of strong or violent anti U.S. sentiment," and as having "a
propensity for violence and antipathy toward good order and government."
All such items were checked on a form in his file. 
<p>     

	 A photograph of Ginsberg was placed in the Federal Narcotics files
in 1967 as if it were a dangerous explosive, and a copy of the photograph
was sent to the FBI. Ginsberg had openly campaigned against what he
regarded as harsh antimarijuana laws that were used to arrest anti Vietnam
War and other protesters. "He is pictured in an indecent pose," the report
said.  "For possible future use, the photograph has been placed in a
locked sealed envelope marked "Photograph of Allen Ginsberg - Gen. File:
ALLEN GINSBERG." The locked sealed envelope has been placed in a vault in
this office for safekeeping. 
<p>     

	The nature of his case was described as "antirioting laws" in 1968
by the Chicago office of the FBI. "[Name blacked out] advised he observed
GINSBERG at Grant Park in front of the Conrad Hilton Hotel in conversation
with associates," his report read. "GINSBERG chanted unintelligible poems
in Grant Park on August 28, 1968." Ginsberg explained that the
"unintelligible poems" were William Blake's "The Grey Monk."
<p>     

	Ginsberg was tracked in this country and abroad. When he returned
from a trip to Montreal in 1969, his valise was opened, bonded and held
for customs inspectors at Kennedy Airport. It contained his manuscripts,
poems, what were described by authorities as obscene photographs, a
position paper on narcotics that he had prepared for Senator Edward
Kennedy, and newspapers. The Ginsberg file reveals that when he gave a
poetry reading in 1970 at Quincy College in Illinois the FBI bureau in
Springfield was alerted to be on the lookout for him because he was an
"IS" (Internal Security) case. It was duly and soberly noted that he was
billed as the "Hippie Poet."
<p>     

	During the first term of the Reagan administration, a list of
eighty four people deemed "unsuitable" as government paid speakers abroad
was prepared by the United States Information Agency. Among the names were
Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate; Coretta Scott King, the black leader;
Betty Friedan, the feminist; John Kenneth Galbraith, Paul Samuelson and
Lester Thurow, economists; and Allen Ginsberg, poet. It was, most felt,
the equivalent of the Nixon administration's "enemies list" - and an honor
to be included, a disappointment to be left off. 
<p>     

	As he demonstrated in one of his recent poems, "Industrial Waves,"
Ginsberg is unstoppable when it comes to defying the authorities with
verse that outrages: "Free computerized National Police! / Everybody got
identity cards? At ease! / Freedom for Big Business to eat up the sea /
Freedom for Exxon to examine your pee!"
<p>     

	He remains at the cutting edge of controversy. His only weapons
are chants and poetry that may be depended on to arouse Washington
officialdom and delight his admiring peers and readers. He continues to
campaign openly for causes he believes in. Ginsberg's plots thicken, and
so undoubtedly does his FBI file.
