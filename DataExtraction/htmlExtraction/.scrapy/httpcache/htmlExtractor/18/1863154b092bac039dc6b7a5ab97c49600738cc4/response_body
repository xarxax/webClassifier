<h2><a name = rev>Review</a></h2>
By Sarah Thompson<P>

This is the gen companion zine of the slash zine <a href="Resist1.html">
Resistance</a>. It's not one of my own top favorites, but there's a lot of
good stuff in it. <P>

I particularly recommend #2 for the art. In general this zine was not great
for art, but #2 is a stellar exception, with gorgeous Lovett and Feyrer.<P>

There's lots of poetry in these zines, presumably because the
editor likes it. I'm not terribly fond of most of it, but
occasionally there is a piece I like, such as Ellie Craven's
charmingly shameless Emily-Dickinson-inspired Avon-drool in #1.<P>

Fans of pro writer Jean Lorrah will enjoy her stories in these two
issues, one of which is a sequel to her adult novel Trust, Like
the Soul. Personally, I find that I like her fan fiction less
than her use of avatars of the B7 characters in her pro fiction; in
the latter case she's freer to play around with them, whereas the
fan stories seem to me to pay too much attention to canonical
detail. But this is a very unusual complaint for me; ordinarily
I'm griping that writers don't pay enough attention to detail.
(Which is why it's so nice to have things like the character bios
posted here, or the Sevencyclopedia, to refer to.)<P>

There are also two connected stories that give Cally a romance (unconsummated
except telepathically) with an original male character. I'm not sure whether
they are by two writers, or one using two names; the style seems consistent,
so probably the latter.<P>

The story by Sheila Paulson in #2 is mostly A-B, but Gan has a very good part
in it too. And it's intense hc with Blake being the hurt one, for a change.
Annie and Leah's "Cross the Border" is somewhat similar in concept to the
Last Stand series, a PGP with a damaged Avon being cared for by Vila. This
could easily become slash, y'know....<P>

Especially interesting in #2 is the Morgan &amp; O'Cullane story, "Mutoid."
PGP, Avon is made into a mutoid; the others, including Blake, who has
survived, kidnap him and try to restore his memory against his own
opposition.<P>

Wasn't this story planned as the first of a series that was never
written?<P>
