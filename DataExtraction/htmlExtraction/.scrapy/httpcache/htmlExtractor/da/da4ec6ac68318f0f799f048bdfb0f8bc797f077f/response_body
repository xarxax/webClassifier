          <p><em><strong>An American Gothic tale of tragedy, hope, and reconciliation</strong></em></p>
          <p>The sleepy town of Winter Haven holds a secret that has been buried for nearly twenty years. At the heart of the controversy is George O’Briens, who, along with his granddaughter, has been outcast by the community. When Mitchell Sanders, a college student from Boston, arrives to help renovate the O’Brien home, he finds himself entrenched in the family’s dirty little secrets, putting him at odds with his new employers and the citizens of Winter Haven.</p>

          <p>While attending university on a fine arts scholarship, Joe spent a lot of time playing the guitar, writing songs, and performing with a band. He won the KFC songwriting contest while in college, and no, he wasn't writing jingles about chicken. He also won a battle of the bands. </p>
          <p><br>
            To support his artistic pursuits, he took time off from college and worked in the oil fields of Wyoming, where he met some interesting characters he could draw upon in his writing. He also spent a few years with a dance group, touring Canada and Europe. </p>
          <p><br>
            After receiving his English degree, he went to work as a technical writer for Thiokol, the manufacturer of space shuttle rocket boosters. Yes, they're the ones responsible for the 1986 Challenger disaster, long before Joe worked for them.</p>
          <p> <br>
            Joe later taught English in Honolulu, Hawaii, and Berkeley, California. During this time, he began focusing seriously on his writing. If you haven't yet read The Black Garden, please take a moment and read the sample chapters at the bottom of this page. </p>

      <h2>What other <strong>Readers</strong> say</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>'The Black Garden' is an enthralling mystery story that will grip readers from the first page to the last.</p>
      <p>&quot;A fantastically atmospheric book. You can feel the tension on every page.&quot; - Robert Foster, best-selling author of The Lunar Code.</p>
      <p>Joe Bright has managed to perfectly blend a large variety of elements to produce a very satisfying read: The dialog is witty and crisp, flowing effortlessly. The prose is beautiful and descriptive, and yet non-effusive; each word obviously carefully chosen. The characters are well developed, and lovable, even with their glaring faults. Humor is a major player in the novel: from joking between characters, to laugh out loud hilarious events.<br>
        I would recommend this book to mystery lovers and skeptics alike. It truly has something for everyone, universal appeal. I will definitely be watching for more of Joe Bright.<br>
  <strong><a href="http://bookthoughtsbylisa.blogspot.com/2009/07/book-review-black-garden.html">Lisa Harvey,</a></strong><a href="http://bookthoughtsbylisa.blogspot.com/2009/07/book-review-black-garden.html"><em>&nbsp;</em><em>Books Ahoy!</em></a></p>
      <p>What is it like to live in a small town where everyone thinks they know what you did? In &quot;The Black Garden&quot;, Joe Bright introduces us to a family closed off from the world by rumour and speculation and so embittered by their experience that it is difficult to like them. His affable young protagonist, Mitchell, takes both the reader and the emotionally scarred O'Brien family by the hand and leads them into a brave new world where nothing is as black as it first appears. With strong prose, striking characters and a plot that fairly zips along, Bright has created a scintillating and compelling read that keeps us guessing until the last moment what the truth of the O'Brien secrets may be. Fantastic! <br>
        <strong>Stef Hall,</strong><em>&nbsp;</em><em>British Literary Critic</em></p>
      <p>The Black Garden is a good read that shouldn’t be passed up. <br>
        <strong>Lucille P Robinson,</strong>&nbsp;<em>Author/Book Reviewer</em></p>
      <p>The Black Garden kept me on the edge of my seat from the very first page. It has a shocking and abrupt start, which I believed was going to lead onto a murder mystery type narrative. Instead it changes pace completely into what appears to be a rather sedate plot in which a young man has been hired by the O'Briens to clear their house out. However not everything is as it seems. The O'Briens are ostracised by the villagers, but why? Joe Bright has created a superb book; he has managed to perfectly blend a large variety of elements to produce a very satisfying read. The prose is beautiful and descriptive; it flows seamlessly and gives very little away. This keeps the reader guessing as to what it is that the O'Briens are hiding, and why the villagers hate them. <br>
      <strong>Lance</strong></p>
      <p>This book is subtle and observant. My favorite thing about it was these occasional moments where the author would make a small observation about a personality trait and I would go "You know what, that's so true! I've seen that in people, the subtlest thing I didn't even notice that I was noticing." This book is great for discoveries like that. I am interested to see more work from Joe Bright. <br>
      <strong>Valerie Wicks, </strong><em>Author</em></p>
      <p>What an amazing read I can not put it down I'm nearly at the end and I dont want it to finish !! The author Grabs your attention &amp; keeps you intrigued on every single page. This book really should be made into a film!! <br>
      <strong>Lissa, </strong><em>UK</em></p>
      <p>I really loved this book, it had great characters, a very gripping plot, which evoked all my emotions and in places laugh out loud funny, Joe, I'm a fan! <br>

                  <br />
                  Edward Calton was the only person who saw   Carolyn O'Brien the day of her suicide. His white milk truck was parked at the   curb with its engine still running. He wore a blue and white uniform with   matching cap and had just finished putting two bottles of milk on Mrs Steiner's   doorstep when he saw Carolyn walking up Cedar Avenue, heading west toward Shady   Bluff. It was a little after 5:00 am. The sun was coming up over the horizon and   most of the town was still sleeping. According to Edward, Carolyn seemed   perfectly at peace with the world, with her purse hanging from her shoulder and   a red ribbon tied in her hair. <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;She even gave me a smile and a wave,&quot;   Edward told the police when they questioned him later that day. &quot;All dressed up   like she was heading off to church.&quot;<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Carolyn's home to Grant   Baxter's was a forty-minute walk. The purple azaleas and red tulips that lined   the home were muted by the morning light, and their fragrance was waiting for   the heat of the day to draw it from the blossoms. Birds had already begun   chirping in the trees as Carolyn crossed the front lawn and climbed the steps to   the porch.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By now Carolyn had tears in her eyes. From her purse, she   removed a handgun that belonged to her father, George O'Brien. He'd bought it   the year before, claiming his family needed protection from the Baxters. He also   didn't trust most of the religious zealots in town who felt they were acting on   God's behalf by persecuting George for doing unmentionable things to his own   daughter. In public, George referred to them as the Klueless Klutz Klan. In   private, he used less flattering terms.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carolyn looked through the   dark living room windows and saw nothing but her own reflection. She brushed the   tears from her cheeks, straightened a stray strand of hair, and then pressed the   barrel of her father's Enfield revolver against her temple. The quiet light of   morning streaked through her light brown hair as she pulled the trigger, putting   an end to her life and adding fuel to the controversy that surrounded her   family.</p>
                <p><span class="h2">Chapter One </span></p>
                <p align="left" class="text"><span style="font-style: italic">May, 1958</span><br />
                  <br />
                  I sat in my Chevy, parked in front of the   O'Brien home, oblivious of Carolyn O'Brien and what she'd done. In fact, I knew   nothing about Winter Haven, Vermont, or how its citizens felt about the   O'Briens. My only contact with the family came through a telephone conversation   I'd had with George two weeks earlier while replying to an ad in the Boston   Globe. <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the house now, I could see why Mr O'Brien had hired   me. With its peeling blue paint and lopsided rain gutters, the three-story   Victorian screamed of neglect. An unkempt weeping willow stood inside the white   picket fence, and tall grass and weeds ran wild through the yard.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I   climbed the steps and knocked at the front door. To its right, a long porch   swing hung from heavy chains that had been painted white at one time but now   showed a lot of silver. The Platters' The Great Pretender drifted from up the   street where a teenager peered under the hood of his car and had his radio   turned up loud.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door opened. A girl in her late teens or early   twenties stepped within the doorframe. She had long, dark blond hair and a quiet   manner that could have passed as either shyness or self-confidence. Even without   makeup and dressed in a baggy pink T-shirt, she was stunning. Perhaps it was the   contrast with the home that caught me by surprise.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Hello. I'm looking   for George O'Brien,&quot; I said.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes were blue and aloof, yet within   their innocence I saw judgment as she studied my face, and then widened the door   and gestured me in without a word.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The living room was decorated in   classic claustrophobia. The pale blue curtains accented the dark blue sofa and   lounge chair. The oak end tables and bureau matched the railing along the stairs   that led to the second floor. The picture frames on the walls and piano all   complemented one another. But once you put the whole picture together, you ended   up with the home of a packrat who had collected more than he could   accommodate.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl went down a hallway that led to the kitchen and   came back with an elderly gentleman, hunched over and supporting himself with a   cane. What little hair he had was light red and combed straight back. I was   surprised later to learn he was sixty-six. He seemed frailer than most men his   age.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Mr O'Brien? I'm Mitchell Sanders.&quot; I extended my hand. &quot;We spoke   on the phone.&quot;<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ignoring my hand, George grunted and shook his head as he   walked around me, looking me up and down as if inspecting a cow at auction. The   inspector here obviously disapproved of what he saw. <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You won't do.&quot; He   shook his head and looked past me to the blond girl, who went to the door to   open it for me to leave.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But we had an agreement on the phone,&quot; I said,   looking from the blond back to George. &quot;I came all the way from Boston.&quot;<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &quot;You're not what I'm looking for. Thank you for coming.&quot;<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But we had an   agreement on the phone.&quot;<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Look at you. You're nothing like what you   described on the phone.&quot; <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What do my looks have to do with   anything?&quot;<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What do you think, Candice?&quot; George ignored me and looked at   his granddaughter. <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I glanced at one and then the other, certain that   they were toying with me, but I could see no humor in their faces.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He's   very ordinary,&quot; said Candice.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old man's eyes shifted from me to his   granddaughter, questioning whether or not he could trust her evaluation of me.   &quot;You brought luggage with you?&quot; said George.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's in my car.&quot;<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &quot;You brought enough for three months?&quot;<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I nodded. &quot;Do you want me to get   it?&quot;<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Later.&quot; His cane tapped the floor as he moved from the carpeted   living room to the linoleum in the hallway. He led me through the kitchen, past   an unfinished game of chess, past their family cat, and out the back door. <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The backyard was more horrifying than the front. It had a garden   quality, yet was cluttered with odd items such as a bathtub, an old bicycle, a   wagon, a table and a lawn mower which, judging by the length of the grass,   hadn't been used in years. The tub, wagon, and other items were filled with dirt   and had flowers planted in them, a sort of eclectic garden. Almost everything   had rusted or turned black and had weeds and flowers twisting among them, giving   it a Gothic look, which sounds more charming than it was.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cement   walkway cut through the right side of the bizarre garden before splitting into   two paths, one leading to a gate in the back fence and the other leading to a   one-room apartment. <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I love what you've done with the place,&quot; I said,   looking around at the clutter. <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George scowled, opened the studio door,   and stepped aside. I stared at the clutter of boxes, paper bags, assorted   household furniture, a collection of clothes the family had outgrown, documents   that no longer served a purpose, and God knows what else.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This is where   you'll stay. You may want to start by cleaning it up. There's a bed under there   somewhere.&quot;<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What should I do with all the stuff?&quot;<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There are   garbage cans out the back gate.&quot;<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You want me to throw it all   out?&quot;<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You told me you're attending Boston University,&quot; said   George.<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm studying literature,&quot; I answered, mistaking George's   statement as an indication of interest. &quot;I'm a writer. At least I'm &hellip;&quot;<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &quot;Then you should be smart enough to figure out what's garbage and what's not.&quot;   George fixed his eyes on me and waited for me to nod before returning to the   house. <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the mess, I realized I wouldn't be getting any sleep   until I first found the bed, which I assumed was buried beneath the tallest   mound of junk. Clearing a path to the windows, I opened the curtains and brought   down a shower of dust. From the window I could see George and Candice settling   down at the table to finish their game of chess. They were strangers whose lives   meant nothing to me other than a paycheck and an escape from Boston. It was my   time of innocence, before I knew their histories, before I knew what the name   O'Brien represented to this small Vermont town. I looked up at the second story   of the house, and then at the attic. I wondered about the rest of the family.   Where were Candice's parents and George's wife? Why were this old man and young   woman alone in such a big house? At the time, I had no idea how significant   those questions were or how much I'd dislike the answers once I learned   them.</p></td>
