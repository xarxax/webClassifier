ofjourneys. I mean the first in fact, most critical one was the journey fromBarbados to Trinidad.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>My particular relation to theCaribbean region was to a large extent formed and shaped in Trinidad throughthe Trinidad experience that got me to realise that there was a cultural area -a unit that was just not Barbados. It was the whole region and I think it hadto do with the time I went to Trinidad.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>I'm arriving in Trinidad at the timewhen Williams is not yet in politics, but he is a very seminal influence inmaking Caribbean history a reality. We had grown up without that dimension andthen not only as writer of something about Capitalism and Slavery, but actualarticulator in person, bringing together of young people to look at documents.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>I always make the point that the firsttime I heard of the Cuban poet, Nicholas Guile and the French poet, AimeCesaire, was through Williams who was telling me that if you are going to be awriter of and for the region, you've got to make this contact. This was beforeWilliams came into politics.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>So that by the time I got to England,this seed was very firmly planted and then it blossomed there in a way becauseit was one of the ironies of history that here we were separated by imperialism- Jamaica from Barbados, Barbados from Trinidad and so on, but it was really atthe metropole at London that we came together, so I first got to know Jamaicaand Guyana and other territories at London and then that was really anextension of that learning to be a Caribbean person.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Then from the fifties, 1955 was myfirst return to the region. When I went, right through the region and it was asa result of a visit to Haiti that was so critical, that I was then veryconscious of the weight of Africa in this region. It was in Haiti that one sawthis and then perhaps my most illuminating experience then of the complexitiesof our situation was a long visit to Guyana which really in a sense made thefirst anti-imperialist breakthrough when Jagan and Burnham were in thatelection in 1953 and had then run into crisis.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>One started to see the kind ofchallenge which confronted us in getting people who had come into the regionwith different cultural traditions who had now been in a sense reshaped by thislandscape.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>How did you get those people to createa solidarity that was so coated and reinforced by their differences and notfragmented by those differences and the novel of <i>Age and Innocence</i></span><spanstyle='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> is really based to a large extent on theGuyanese experience; the collapse of that movement of the 1950s. From then on,there have always been this movement and I think it was true of a number of thewriters that although those early books were written outside of the Caribbean, thispreoccupation with the Caribbean was never eroded by distance, by livingelsewhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>A very good example of it, althoughthe persona appears to be different is every book that Naipaul writes infiction is really about Trinidad even though it may be set in Africa somewhere.It is a Trinidad experience. It is informing the organisation of that narrativeand of those problems that I think, I would say that from about the beginningof the sixties, I entered into the region not just as witness and observer, butin a sense as a certain kind of activist and that started I would say as aresult of an invitation I had received from a group of people who were thenknown as the New World Group.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The New World Group is a very, veryimportant chapter in our cultural history which was founded by Lloyd Best invery close association with James Milette, with the Economist, Gorge Beckfordof Jamaica, Girvan of Jamaica, Thomas of Guyana and I would say that one of thegreat contributions they made was to change the agenda of this course thatwhereas we talked about the Caribbean as it reacted to Colonial power and soon; if you go through all of those issues, you would see for the first time,that the Caribbean is being put at the centre of the agenda and although theywere academics, the kinds of issues that they dealt with, then pulled thenon-academic into it.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The big discussion on sugar was reallyinitiated by the New World and the sugar planters. All sort of people gotinvolved in that. Involved around the question of what was the future of sugarthat we needed and so on and so forth and ass we came into these independencearrangements, what they did was to ask me to come out from London, first toGuyana and then to Barbados because they wanted to get at two special issueswhich were known as the Guyana Independence issue and the Barbados Independenceissue and I did these then, one, Guyana issue in association with the poet,Martin Carter and then we came here and did the Barbados issue. What was veryinteresting about these issues, if you got them, is that we saw theindependence of Guyana not as a Guyanese affair. This was a matter thatconcerned the whole region.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>We did the same thing with theBarbados issue. The Barbados issue was edited from this house. I'd rented thishouse for the year and we did that. Every West Indian writer and intellectual,whether resident here or abroad contributed to those issues and when you wereasked questions about alternatives and so on, I would say that we have been onan alternative road for some time, that is, the foundations of that road werelaid. Alternative means that you were no longer talking to the society as itwas presented to you from outside, but you were in fact identifying foryourself what you thought were the settled issues of this region and analysingfor yourself what were those issues.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>This interaction then, continuedthrough the seventies which was very marked by the emergence of ideology inpolitical combat and you saw that<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>shift in Jamaica in the seventieswhere there never seemed to be philosophy; any profound difference between thetwo parties, but from about the seventies when terms like socialism, later thelegacy of the return of Walter Rodney, articulating the meaning of that power.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>For the next decade or so, we werevery much involved in struggles that could be called ideological, which tookcomplete form or tried to take complete political from with the Grenadarevolution which started in 1979 and then ended in that tragically suicidal wayin 1983. For some time, I was very close to Maurice Bishop during that periodand to the Minister of Culture and Education, Jacquelyn Creft and what had alsodeveloped as a part of that agenda was the role in which the communicationsmedia would function in the re-discovery or the re-creation of what we call theCaribbean.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Throughout all of the educationsystem, the school really presented you to yourself by an external eye and whatmany people within the political culture were trying to do was to find a way inwhich the society could return itself to itself through its own mediators andin this area we find that there was a lot of deficiencies.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Some time in the sixties, I waslecturing to students on the need to hasten what I call the regionalisation ofthe media. To give a concrete example...........<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>What I've forgotten to emphasisereally is that the writer sometimes does not know where the influence is andwhat comes to be called his work begins. My relation to Trinidad ... the visitto Trinidad in the middle and late forties - prove for me to be very decisive.I don't think that I would have been the kind of Caribbean person that I amtoday if I had gone from Barbados, directly to London. It was that interveningstop to Trinidad where I lived for about four or five years and although wetend sometimes to look back at that kind of doldrum period and so on, it wasreally a moment of great liberation for me after Barbados.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>I cannot recall that there was verymuch of a cultural movement in Barbados that was indigenous, so that I am goingto be in Trinidad when the Little Carib was about to be born and that LittleCarib served as a kind of soil that made everybody with any kind of creativeinstinct gravitate towards it. So I think that without knowing it at the time, ifyou look at some of the novels where <i>The Season of Adventure</i></span><spanstyle='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> is a very good example which really, probablythe first example of a novel that is really dedicated to.....<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Yes, I was saying we never really knowhow we are influenced in the production of work and if you look at <i>Season ofAdventure</i></span><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>, whch is probablythe first novel and probably the only one which is in a sense devoted to theelevation of the steelband not only as a moment of great culture and triumph,but also showing the way in which cultural activity can be so decisive inpolitical life.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>In <i>Season of Adventure</i></span><spanstyle='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>, the republic collapses to a large extent, dueto the intervention and demonstration of the Government and I think then much laterwhen I got to Jamaica and saw the Jamaica Dance Company, not many peoplerealised the extent to which the Little Carib in Trinidad was almost the motherof the Jamaica Dance Theatre and it would be very difficult for me to think ofthe cultural history of this region …<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>My mother, stepfather lived inTrinidad, but since I've been back here in a more settled way from theeighties, in a way, Barbados has been like a base because for six months of theyear, I am somewhere else and a lot of that time, that somewhere is in somepart of the region responding to requests to lecture, give various talks andseminars either to workers' groups or to schools or universities. Whenever Ithink of the media in the region, I am really taken back to my earliest experiencesof the media, which really was in England when I arrived there in the fifties.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>I worked for a number of years withthe BBC Overseas Service and especially with the programme, people would knowof Caribbean Voices, but what came home to me was the very vital way in whichyou could help a society to hear and see itself through that media and that wasdue to the fact that I had been engaged a lot in what was known as adocumentary feature.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>BBC was very strong originators ofthat particular form and I then had a personal interest in writing for andworking in the radio. I never really had an opportunity to do it. One occasionwas in Guyana around the time of the Independence of Guyana and I made a radioprogramme. It was about a series of five from the Literature. That is takingextracts of various writers and so on as a sort of tribute to the people ofGuyana and then some time in the seventies, I attempted to do a documentary onthe history of labour in Barbados through the bringing together of these voicesacross to three generation. This is really what in a way sometimes depresses mebecause I think that in order for the writers to function in this society, away would have to be found to make them very central to the media, very centralto radio, very central to television which is after all based on words and theother proposal which I had made and you see the beginning of it. I think I mayhave mentioned it earlier, the regionalising of the media, it should becomenormal for a third or whatever programmes, radio that have been heard inTrinidad be made in Jamaica or Barbados.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The same for Barbados - a third or soother programmes that have been made in some other island. In a way, what radioand television would be doing at a popular level was really in a sense what theNew World Group was doing at the level of that kind of analysis and the otherthing that could be done really is that you can't make radio from studio.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>I mean if you're really going to makeeffective radio, as happens also with television, you really have to go out andin fact make people who are the subject of the theme become the articulators ofthe theme. Now I think that for the future, it seems to me that there is no waythe literature of the region would become a part of the consciousness of thisregion unless that literature gets translated into film.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>And that is what we really have towork on. Selvon, Naipaul, Lovelace should be as normal viewing to Trinidad andCaribbean audience as the imported stock is today. So I think that I do notbelieve it helps to intensify attacks on the imported stock because theresponsibility is really upon us to replace it by what is already there andthis requires simply first of all improving the technical skills of those whowork in that area and pooling the intellectual human resource of the wholeregion. We have no deficiency in that area or deficiency in the areas ofcommunication and collaboration.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Let me put it this way. Quite oftenpeople do not know what they have. It's only when they try to examinethemselves in a particular situation that they discover that they have thisresource and I think that it is a result of, in a way, the privileges of familyand going across the region that I came to realise that over the years, thatthere was a Caribbean reality which was there, which touched differentterritories in different ways, but which had not yet come fully into theconsciousness of each territory.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>I think of cricket for example andwhen you look at the history of the West Indies team, it's very difficult tothink of the emergence of a great batsman like Kanhai without the fact thatWalcott went to work in Guyana for Bookers. Last year, I was at a conferencefor the Indian presence in the Caribbean and they brought Ramadhin and I wasvery struck to hear him speak about the importance that Worrel as a leader andcaptain had to do with helping him adjust from that present background in SouthTrinidad to the mystery of Lords and just a month ago, I was attending aconference in Guadeloupe and all the discussion just change the language wouldhave been the exchanges taking place in Trinidad and more and more, it comesclear to me that what you call being Trinidadian or what I would call beingBarbadian will never be fully realised if you wouldn't even be the kind ofTrinidadian you should be and so that becomes an essential part of thatTrinidad consciousness.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>So the evolution of each territorydepends very much on the forging and the incorporating of that Caribbeanreality into the consciousness of each. Some of the writers know it. Some ofthe people who analyse society would know it, but some of the people who wouldsometimes know it better than others are traders.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>We have atremendous kind of huckster trade that moves between Grenada and Haiti; betweenGrenada and Trinidad; between Dominica and Barbados and they are the mostCaribbean. They are much more Caribbean than the academics and quite often,they are much more sophisticated in languages. Quite often they speak morelanguages than the average academic. If there is any reason at all for workingas a writer, it is in the full knowledge that we are only perhaps a Chapter Oneof the new meaning of Caribbean civilisation.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><spanstyle='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id="_x0000_i1033" type="#_x0000_t75" style='width:238pt;height:180pt'> <v:imagedata src="lamming_files/image010.jpg" o:title="lamming2"/></v:shape><![endif]--><![if !vml]><img border=0 width=238 height=180src="lamming_files/image011.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1033"><![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>If it were possible to put bricks orsomething right across here, right across the Ocean, the first piece of landthat you would touch would be Dakar in Senegal.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><spanstyle='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p><div align=center><table border=1 cellpadding=0 style='mso-cellspacing:1.5pt;mso-padding-alt: 0in 0in 0in 0in'> <tr>  <td style='padding:0in 0in 0in 0in' cellspacing=40>  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CARRIBEAN  style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CARRIBEAN'><a href="catalog.htm"><span  style='font-family:Arial;color:red;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'><b><span><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape   id="_x0000_i1034" type="#_x0000_t75" style='width:18pt;height:17pt'>   <v:imagedata src="lamming_files/image003.gif" o:title="button2"/>  </v:shape><![endif]--><![if !vml]><img border=0 width=18 height=17  src="lamming_files/image012.png" v:shapes="_x0000_i1034"><![endif]></span></b></span></a></span><span  lang=EN-CARRIBEAN style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:  EN-CARRIBEAN'><b><span>Banyan Programme Catalogue&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></b></span></p>  </td>  </span>  <td valign=top style='padding:0in 0in 0in 0in'>  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CARRIBEAN  style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CARRIBEAN'><a href="index.htm"><span  style='font-family:Arial;color:red;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'><b><span><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape   id="_x0000_i1035" type="#_x0000_t75" style='width:18pt;height:17pt'>   <v:imagedata src="lamming_files/image003.gif" o:title="button2"/>  </v:shape><![endif]--><![if !vml]><img border=0 width=18 height=17  src="lamming_files/image013.png" v:shapes="_x0000_i1035"><![endif]></span></b></span></a></span><span  lang=EN-CARRIBEAN style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:  EN-CARRIBEAN'><b><span>Banyan Home Page&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></b></span></p>  </td>  </span>  <td valign=top style='padding:0in 0in 0in 0in'>  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CARRIBEAN  style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CARRIBEAN'><a href="archive.htm"><span  style='font-family:Arial;color:red;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'><b><span><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape   id="_x0000_i1036" type="#_x0000_t75" style='width:18pt;height:17pt'>   <v:imagedata src="lamming_files/image003.gif" o:title="button2"/>  </v:shape><![endif]--><![if !vml]><img border=0 width=18 height=17  src="lamming_files/image014.png" v:shapes="_x0000_i1036"><![endif]></span></b></span></a></span><span  lang=EN-CARRIBEAN style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:  EN-CARRIBEAN'><b><span>Banyan Archive Summary&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></b></span></p>  </td>  </span>  <td style='padding:0in 0in 0in 0in'>  <p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span  lang=EN-CARRIBEAN style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CARRIBEAN'><a  href="extract.htm"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:red;text-decoration:  none;text-underline:none'><b><span><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape id="_x0000_i1037"   type="#_x0000_t75" style='width:18pt;height:17pt'>   <v:imagedata src="lamming_files/image003.gif" o:title="button2"/>  </v:shape><![endif]--><![if !vml]><img border=0 width=18 height=17  src="lamming_files/image015.png" v:shapes="_x0000_i1037"><![endif]></span></b></span></a></span><span  lang=EN-CARRIBEAN style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:  EN-CARRIBEAN'><b><span>This Month's Archive Extract&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></b></span></p>  </td> </tr></table></div><p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><spanstyle='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><spanstyle='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><spanstyle='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</span><span lang=EN-CARRIBEAN style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-CARRIBEAN'><b><span>Banyan Limited,&nbsp;&nbsp;3 AdamSmith Square,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
