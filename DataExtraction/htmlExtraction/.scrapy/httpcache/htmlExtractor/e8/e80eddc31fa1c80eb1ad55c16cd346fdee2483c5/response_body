Dos Passos is  regarded as among the first four or five contemporary writers,  and some place him first.<BR>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selections from <I>U.S.A.,</I>  the author's most famous and important work, appear in almost  any recent anthology of American literature, used as a standard  college text. The <I>Oxford Anthology of American Literature</I>  says in part concerning Dos Passos and his work:</FONT></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>    <BLOCKQUOTE>      <P><FONT SIZE="+1">Upon completion of his trilogy...<I>U.S.A.,</I>      John Dos Passos emerged as a major figure in contemporary American      fiction. No less remarkable than his assimilation of the historical      events and situations which characterized the years of the World      War and the decade immediately following it was his ability to      create a new technique in the writing of a social novel....</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inclusion of <I>U.S.A.</I>  among the select group of Modern Library books, where it keeps  company with works by Victor Hugo, Charles Dickens, Ralph Waldo  Emerson, Homer, Plato, and similar revered names, is an indication  that it is not only a popular work but a work of serious artistic  value.<BR>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Dos Passos and his works  are studied, discussed, and evaluated in undergraduate and graduate  courses devoted to the study of American literature everywhere  throughout the United States. Despite the fact that the author  is living and less than fifty, Harvard dissertations have been  undertaken in the study and evaluation of his works.</FONT></P>  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+2">. . .</FONT></CENTER></P>  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Objection may be made that <I>U.S.A.</I>  contains, as it does, some profane or obscene language, &quot;tough&quot;  characters, and actions unbecoming well-bred people. It is true  that the Victorian Age would have rejected this book, but this  age has rejected the Victorian Age. Right or wrong, modern publishers,  modern writers, modern critics overwhelmingly agree that the  use of such material is permissible if it serves a legitimate  purpose. No serious artist would try to justify obscenity for  the sake of obscenity, though some modern fiction is merely nasty  for no justifiable reason. No one who has read <I>U.S.A.,</I>  instead of skipping along to find &quot;hot stuff,&quot; could  for a moment maintain that it is an &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;immoral&quot;  book. A book may contain examples of immorality without being  itself immoral. <I>U.S.A.</I> could not possibly debauch anyone.  It does not make sin attractive. People looking for pornigraphical  reading are not known, I believe, to wade through <I>U.S.A.</I><BR>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his view of what may or may  not be legitimate material for fiction, Dos Passos is in agreement  with nine-tenths of our most famous contemporary writers--Hemingway,  Faulkner, Wolfe, Farrell, and Steinbeck, to name a few.</FONT></P>  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+2">. . .</FONT></CENTER></P>  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>U.S.A.</I> is a sociological  novel. Its purpose is to show in the medium of fiction some of  the intricate economic, social, and political factors which have  made modern civilization what it is. There can be no doubt that  the author looks almost exclusively at the darker side of the  picture. His interest is not to glorify the best aspects of American  life. That job has been amply done. With candor and courage,  he has tried to seek out in the frustrated, pathetic, broken  lives of a great section of the American people the conditions  of the economic, moral, and social crises and collapses of the  years 1900 to 1942. A world that within the space of a quarter-century  has been convulsed by the two most devastating wars in the history  of mankind is a world in which imperfection perhaps outweighs  perfection. Dos Passos is one of those who believe that part  of the trouble lies in the fact that one half of the world--and  that the most cultivated, the most intelligent, the most energetic--steadfastly  refuses to see how the other half lives.</FONT></P>  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+2">. . .</FONT></CENTER></P>  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With reference to the way in which  I use <I>U.S.A.</I> in a college English course, I wish to make  a few observations.<BR>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>U.S.A.</I> is really three  novels printed together, and it is too long to be read in its  entirety for class work. Because of its plan, it lends itself  well to selective treatment. One of its faults--and it is not  devoid of faults--is an overabundance of material. An artful  selection and assignment of material can minimize this defect  of the book and at the same time illustrate the techniques and  purposes of the novelist as well as if the whole novel were assigned.<BR>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not personally interested  in the &quot;tough&quot; parts of the book. I do not discuss  them in class. As it happens, the assignments I make from the  book avoid most of the more violent passages, although such an  avoidance is not the basis of selection. I am simply not interested  in such passages, and they are of no importance to the purposes  for which I teach the book, except in so far--and the point needs  no belaboring--they illustrate modern practice in that regard.  Certainly, there would never be anything in the class discussion  of the book which would offend anyone.<BR>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ordinarily I prefer that fiction  assigned be short enough so that it can be handled in its entirety.  All other fiction connected with the course has been selected  with that in view. But <I>U.S.A.</I> is a special work, and I  propose special objectives in its use. Whatever the novel selected,  my treatment of it is very different from the usual high school  method. In high school, emphasis is placed on the novel as a  story. Often other and frequently higher implications of the  novel, if any, are left for the student to guess at. The high  school teacher is fortunate if his students remember the action  of the novel, and high school students are generally tested upon  the story alone.<BR>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a novel like <I>U.S.A.,</I>  the students are not required to memorize details and summarize  narrative. Such a procedure would be entirely alien to the purpose  and spirit of the work. I like for the novel selected to serve  as a point of departure for a discussion of important aspects  of modern life and approach to art. The novel chosen is discussed  in its relationship to other novels of its class and its time.<BR>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The students are free to accept  or reject any of the criticism of life or art associated with  a novel like <I>U.S.A</I>. I reject some of it myself. I only  require of my students that they think as honestly and deeply  as possible, write as well as possible, formulate convictions,  and maintain them with good arguments.</FONT></P>  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+2">. . .</FONT></CENTER></P>  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The variety and richness of material  in <I>U.S.A.</I> make that work a good one for illustrating the  techniques and purposes of modern writers. Here are some of the  more important objectives which I wish to reach in a class discussion  of the novel:</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">1. I illustrate from the book the preponderant  interest which modern writers take in the lives of the disinherited  of the earth, the emphasis on the common, the everyday, as subject-matter  for writing.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">2. I point out the manner in which the book  reproduces in a way impossible for the historian and sociologist  the living, plastic stream of life in the American past. I point  out--although it is unnecessary for the girls whom I teach--that  this is not intended to represent the whole of American life.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">3. I illustrate the extent to which the modern  novel has been attempting, with varying degrees of success, to  take over some of the functions of the sociologist, the economic  theorist, and the historian.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">4. I illustrate how the novel can be used  for propaganda purposes.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">5. I illustrate how the book contains important  reflections, direct and indirect, of such events within the past  forty years as World War I, the Roaring Twenties, the Stock Market  Crash, and the beginning of the Great Depression.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">6. I emphasize a device regularly employed  throughout the book--namely, the introduction of real personages  in sketches which at one time personify a man and a period in  American life. Much of the reading assigned is devoted to those  justly famed pen-portraits of William Jenning Bryan, Woodrow  Wilson, Henry Ford, Rudolph Valentino, and other representative  figures.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">7. I show how the writer is careful to give  us the authentic d&eacute;cor of the period and the milieu portrayed.  In this respect, the work is a work of scholarship--really an  over-elaborate piece of documentation.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">8. I illustrate the variety of new techniques  which Dos Passos employs as a writer, how the attempt is made  at times to perform in prose the traditional functions of poetry,  how much of the novel is experimental in technique, how much  of it is at the same time simple, straightforward, unadorned.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">9. More specifically, I show how the example  of the motion picture has influenced the art of fiction--the  visual character of much of the writing, the use of flashbacks,  odd camera angles, the effort to perform in writing the office  of the News Reel.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">10. I show the influence of newspaper writing  on fiction and explain the use of selected newspaper headlines,  which give the flavor of a bygone day just as it passed before  the eyes of the people.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">11. I illustrate from the book how modern  writers are experimenting with words--compounding words, seeking  new words, taking words from technology. I hope thereby to teach  the students an important fact about language which few of them  understand--namely, that it is changing all the time, that we  are continually creating it.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE="+1">12. I hope incidentally to cultivate in the  minds of our students (who are often very uncharitable toward  those in harder straits than themselves) an attitude of sympathy  toward the underprivileged, an indignation at the evils of society  on some levels, a determination someday to do something about  it all when they are helping to erect the new world on the ruins  of the old.</FONT></P>  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+2">. . .</FONT></CENTER></P>  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><BR>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think anyone will agree that  the objectives outlined above are valid (setting aside now the  question as to the merit of the novel <I>U.S.A.</I>); but it  may be argued that there are many other objectives which can  be pursued in a course in Freshman English to as good advantage,  and without reading <I>U.S.A.</I> I agree that many other objectives  should be sought in a course in Freshman English, and I wish  to observe that the assigned readings in <I>U.S.A.</I> and class  discussions of it, leaving out the interspersion of other work,  will occupy about two weeks of the class time--that is to say,  about one sixteenth of the total time devoted to Freshman English.  In the rest of the course our reading is taken from a standard  anthology, our writing consists of the usual practice in composition,  and in both the first and second semesters other fiction will  be assigned and read, in which, of course, I shall not care to  repeat the objectives obtained in a discussion of <I>U.S.A.</I><BR>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am aware that readers of college  age need guidance in the understanding of a work of this kind.  I have been so much disturbed by the suggestion that someone  may have been offended by the choice of this novel that I have  taken the matter up with the class and offered to permit the  reading of some other novel for all or any who would prefer to  read something else. I have assured my students that this change  would be in no way prejudicial to their mark in the course. No  one took advantage of this offer in class, and for fear someone  might hesitate to volunteer objections before the class, I set  a time when I might be seen by individuals or a delegation of  the entire class. No one came. Of course, a single individual  without support would probably feel a reluctance to come. The  offer still stands.<BR>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a deep conviction that  two weeks of a Freshman English class can be profitably spent  in a guided introduction to contemporary writing through the  medium of the novel <I>U.S.A.</I> If it be objected that this  immersion should be delayed until the students are more mature,  I wish to observe that for many of the students at Simmons, the  last course in college English which they will take (the last  course in English which they will ever take) is the Freshman  course. We intend at Simmons, among other things, to provide  the girls with a practical preparation for life. The future nurses,  secretaries, social workers, writers, laboratory workers, and  business women now in my classes can, I think, be at least as  well served in their preparation for life by a book which permits  the objectives stated as by a classic 19th century novel.<BR>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I had been acquainted with  a modern novel which would enable me as a teacher to reach the  objectives enumerated above and at the same time avoid all the  faults and disadvantages rightly or wrongly ascribable to <I>U.S.A.,</I>  I would have chosen it.<BR>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe my personal ability  as a teacher is not at issue in this matter. I have not wished  to imply--and I am far from believing--that I am always &quot;a  great big success&quot; in realizing the objective I set for  myself as a teacher.</FONT></P>  <P ALIGN=RIGHT><I><FONT SIZE="+1">--Ross F.
