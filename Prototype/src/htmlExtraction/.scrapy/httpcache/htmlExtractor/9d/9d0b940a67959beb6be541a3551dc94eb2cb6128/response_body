<p><a name="Introduction"></a>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; This show is something like a younger-girl's Marmalade Boy,
 without as much hysteria, but with lots of nostalgia and coming-of-age drama.
 Like Miyazaki's Kiki (of <a href="tapelis3.htm#kiki">Kiki's Delivery Service</a>
  ), Yuuko is a young girl you can't help but like, and sympathize with,
and  remember how you went through the exact same traumas at her age. This
reminds  me of the American TV series, "The Wonder Years," another splendid
nostalgic  look at childhood, dating, and friendships. </p>

<small><small><b><font size="+2">Exciting News -- DVD Release! &nbsp;Then,
 Disappointment...</font></b></small></small></center>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the beginning of January 2002, I discovered that
 some fans in Japan were talking about the rumored release of Mizuirojidai
 on DVD.  There are two main fan websites in Japan, and they both put up
notes  to inform others of the rumors. Later, a fan put more information
in a dummy  auction on Yahoo-Japan, and that  got copied onto the Japanese
websites.  About that time, I put a notice on our main page, and continued
waiting.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We ordered the set from <a href="http://www.amotokyo.com">
  AMOTOKYO</a>
   and it arrived! &nbsp;To celebrate the new video source, we plan to move
 volume 4 of "The BlueGreen Years" to highest priority (after BDB 33-36)
and  release its fansub next.  Then we'll open volume 5 up to sponsorship
and begin translation of it. Between fansubs, we'll remaster the first 3
volumes.  The second box set will be needed before we can work on volume
6.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Even though it's wonderful to see a real video release of 
Mizuirojidai finally, I must say that I'm a bit disappointed.&nbsp; The video 
quality isn't as good as I expected from a Pioneer release. From the titles, 
it looks like Pioneer only functioned as the distributor for this.&nbsp; The
producer was "MMI" -- "Marvelous Music". &nbsp; I had to check the disks on
both a DVD player and directly grabbing frames to see what was going on.&nbsp; 
Here's what I found... </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>(1) Noise, 29.97fps, and double telecine.</b>&nbsp; 
There is a fair amount of video noise present, more than other comparable 
DVD releases, such as Bandai's "Ace wo Nerae" which is two decades older.&nbsp; 
They used some low quality equipment to do the digitization. &nbsp;Furthermore, 
they acquired the video at NTSC framerate (29.97 fps) instead of the native 
24fps. &nbsp;This is a glaring indication of something very wrong. &nbsp; 
Then, they did the editing at that framerate, and re-exported the video with 
telecine. This resulted in large scale ugliness in the frame progression. 
&nbsp;A typical non-interlaced frame pattern I saw in the source was 11100010001110001000... 
instead of the normal 10100101001010010100... which is a telltale sign of 
a double telecine. &nbsp;This accentuates the noise in the image and means 
that the DVD release contains 29.97 non-pulldown MPEG2 instead of the preferred
24 fps 3:2 pulldown NTSC which is used by professionals for animation and
film. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>(2) No frame stabilization</b> was used anywhere 
in the digital mastering process. This is a serious oversight, because Mizuirojidai 
was a low budget production which used old equipment, and the camera wobbled 
during photography -- mostly in a left-right direction.&nbsp; The annoying 
wobble is very visible and distracting. I'll be using a frame stabilizer to
fix this problem wherever possible. &nbsp;In this sense, the fansub might 
end up looking nicer than the original.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>(3) Cable reflection shadow.</b>&nbsp; This is the 
most amazing defect of all.&nbsp; The frames seem to show a faint shadow, 
offset by about 15 pixels to the right, of the video image.&nbsp; This is 
equivalent to a cable whose length is about 6 meters. During the conversion 
from film to video, a long and imperfectly terminated cable must have been 
used for the video signal.&nbsp; This is totally inexcusable, and is a mark 
of unprofessional work.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>So altogether</b>, it was a cheaply done, quite amateurish 
DVD that still leaves me &nbsp;wishing I had a good quality video source!&nbsp; 
This is certainly an order of magnitude better than the tapes I had archived, 
but it is quite a disappointment.&nbsp; I hate to say it, but it reminds me
of American anime DVD's -- or even more, Taiwan or Hong Kong unlicensed DVD's.
Who did this, really? &nbsp;And why? I'm very happy to have the DVD's, and
I'll buy the second set, but there's no other choice. &nbsp;I am forced to
advise videophile anime collectors that they should be prepared for a shock
if they buy these DVD's. &nbsp;They are (I am not kidding) the WORST anime
DVD's I have ever seen coming from a Japanese company.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>In general, though</b>... it took a long time for 
the DVD's to be announced -- 5 years. Our first 3 volumes had to be made from
some carefully-prepared SVHS source tapes of the show made from rental copies
in Japanese video stores in Northern California. <br>
</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp; This was a perfect example of a shoujo show which receives 
little or no aftermarket activity.&nbsp; In fact, the final eight episodes 
shown on TV appear to have been intended to be OAV's originally.&nbsp; This 
implies that the poor ratings of the show caused plans for the OAV's to be 
cancelled.&nbsp; The 8 weeks occupied by the former OAV's were time spent 
in preparing the show's replacement, "Kero Kero Chaimu".  </p>

<img src="gfx_bgy/bgy_an.gif" alt="Yuuko and Hiroshi" height="161" width="152" align="Right">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In volume 1, We meet the 3 main characters Yuuko, Takako,
 and Hiroshi. Takako has an enormous crush on Hiroshi -- but romance is never
 simple in Junior High School, as you will see! A terrible conflict threatens
 the friendship between Takako and Yuuko, and the unfolding events sweep
them  all away during the school camping trip. Meanwhile, Yuuko finds herself 
on her school's softball team, and is suffering through the frustrating torment
 of having NO athletic talent whatsoever (as she puts it, "I don't have athletic
 bones.") You'll enjoy the script -- Anna Exter's lively and vernacular translation
 style perfectly suits the show. This volume was made from a TAPE source,
though our method of processing the tape gives very good results -- the laserdisks
 have not even been announced yet, and in fact may never be released at all. 
 <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have remastered this show on 12-29-97.&nbsp; This 
is revision 4.&nbsp; Volume 1 still contains the original commercials (not 
subtitled) but they are all moved to end of the tape, so the episodes themselves 
are not interrupted.&nbsp; We made other improvements to the script, and upgraded
it to our current font standard.&nbsp; The video is slightly better, but
is still from a tape source. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; If you ask someone for a copy of this tape, you might inquire
 whether it is revision 3 or 4.&nbsp; (or heaven forbid, revision 2, which
 was pretty bad...)&nbsp; You can tell by looking at the introductory part
 of the tape.&nbsp; We recommend revision 4.   
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Translation was done expressly for the Techno-Girls by Anna
 Exter, of Gibsons, British Columbia, Canada. [Current Revision: 4]&nbsp; 
Contents: 1. THE NEW TERM; 2. FRIENDSHIP; 3. THE SCHOOL CAMP; 4. THE SOFTBALL 
TOURNAMENT; plus additional fan notes and comments. <br>

   &nbsp;&nbsp; Volume 3 was translated for us by Anna Exter, recently turned 
 to doing professional translation for Bandai USA.&nbsp; Instead of stripping 
 out ALL of the commercials, we kept 3 of them in, because they were fun and
related to manga and Ciao magazine.&nbsp; Revision 1 is dated 10-9-98.&nbsp;

middle  school students (8th grade).&nbsp; But her grades seem to be going
DOWN instead  of up!&nbsp; While Hiroshi is near the top of his class, Yuuko
finds she is near the bottom, and the academic distance between the two of
them becomes  a real, tangible distance in their relationship as well.&nbsp;

 Harrison <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; What kind of boy would get a crush on Takako?&nbsp; None of
 her friends can even imagine such a thing!&nbsp; But that seems indeed to
 be what has happened.&nbsp; Takako isn't particularly tactful about making
 it clear that she isn't interested.&nbsp; In fact she's downright blunt
about  it all.&nbsp; But suddenly, maybe she IS interested -- or has she
just decided  it's more important to be a good friend?&nbsp; And then...
the worst possible  thing... and the best possible thing... both happen at
once.&nbsp; Don't miss this episode. <br>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 12. "Pulling Rank"</b> -- brought to you by Paulo Ricardo 
 Cruz <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Japanese middle schools have two grades, and the second-year 
 students (9th graders) are "sempai" (senior) to the first-year students (8th
graders) who are "kouhai" (junior).&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a system of seniority
and rank (and sometimes bullying too) which is found everywhere in Japanese
society and students just have to get used to it. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Now Yuuko and Takako are both "sempai" and in charge of training
 the first-year students in their Band Club.&nbsp; But Yuuko is too tenderhearted
 to maintain proper discipline, and Takako is too domineering to handle the
 job without resorting to bullying.&nbsp; Between the two of them, they make
 a real mess of sempai/kouhai relations in the club! </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp; The Japanese fan magazine Animedia ran an introductory article
 on Mizuirojidai in 1996 (I don't have the date, sorry) as the show's first
 episodes were showing.&nbsp; This was a series of spotlights on shows picked
 by their viewers as among the ten best new animes of 1996.&nbsp; Mizuirojidai
 placed number 9 in the poll. About 3/5ths of those who voted the show their
 favorite were male viewers, surprisingly.&nbsp; (Bear in mind that though
 Animedia has a large female readership, perhaps more than any other fan
magazine,  the majority of its readers are still male, which swings the statistics.)&nbsp; 
 Number one was Escaflowne, of course.</dd>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previously, I noticed that most of the sites on
 the Internet with information on Mizuirojidai were using scans and graphics
 taken from our site here.&nbsp; I expressed a wish that those sites would
 be courteous enough to leave a link back to the site they took the graphics
 from, or to otherwise mention this page.  However, new sites from 1998 on
 seem to have taken a clue from reading my comment in the page here.  But
instead of giving any credit, some of them just made sure to take their images
from somewhere else.  An aside: you know how you can easily tell a commercial
site from a courteous amateur site?  The amateur site will have a list of
links.  The commercial site won't, because the LAST thing they want to do
is to give you any reason to depart their site.  So when they take something
from another site, they generally will not give any credit or links or mention
 of any sort.  (There are a few rare exceptions.)</dd>

        <p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People who haven't seen the fansub are always 
emailing  us and asking "Isn't the correct translation of "Mizuirojidai" given
as "Aqua Age"? I'll put the answer here, to save having to write the same
answer over and over. &nbsp;The explanation involves the reason that the
show got called "Mizuiro jidai" in the first place.  It's a long explanation
 involving kanji puns so if you don't get excited by ideograms,  you probably
 should skip ahead.  </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a common word in Japanese called "seishun".
  It means "youth" or "teenage years". It gets used a lot when one is explaining
 those crazy "days of youth."  For instance, if you wanted to say "I was
just  being a typical teenager." you would say something like "Seishun shite
ita nan desu." (Pardon if that isn't perfectly grammatical...)   [As a side
note, there was a college group in the  US named "Seishun Shitemasu" that
once did some naughty anime parodies. I wonder what happened to them.]  </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, a very very common phrase with "seishun"
 is  "seishun jidai" which means "days of youth". The "jidai" is the same
one as in "Mizuiro Jidai" and it means "period of time."  &nbsp;Youthfullness 
has the color blue associated with it in  Japanese, just like we might associate
 the color green with "jealousy" or purple with "royal." Apparently the reason
 for this is (and I don't really know which is the cause and which is the
 effect) because of the kanji which are used to write "seishun".  If you
pronounce those kanji using the Chinese readings, you get the correct reading
 of "sei" &amp; "shun" but if you use the alternate Japanese readings, you
get "aoi" &amp; "haru".  Those words mean "blue" and "spring." &nbsp;The
Chinese usage is possibly based on the idea that the "spring of life" is
one's "youth".</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, all Japanese speaking persons who read the 
 word "seishun" meaning "youth" also see "blue spring" when they look at the
word.  Not only  that, the "aoi" (blue) kanji sometimes means "green." So,
we have "blue-green spring".  The only other word in Japanese which means
 "blue-green" is "mizuiro".  What the author did is to transform the phrase
 "seishun jidai" into "mizuiro jidai". When she did that, EVERYONE in Japan
 knew exactly what she meant, because they all knew it was a "blue-green
spring"  pun on "seishun."  There is a name for this type of "wrong-reading
kanji pun" but I forgot it at the moment.  Take my word  for it, this type
of game in manga titles is REALLY common.  </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This wasn't the only part of the pun she intended, 
though. &nbsp;She poetically meant to express the difference between a young 
adult and a pre-adolescent using the difference in the colors "Aoi" (blue) 
and "Mizuiro" (pale blue, or perhaps greenish not-quite-blue). &nbsp;In this 
sense, she reasoned, "Aoi" is a more "ripened" or "matured" color compared 
to "mizuiro". &nbsp;(It should be pointed out that there is no consistency 
in the Japanese or Chinese perception of the color "Aoi" which &nbsp;historically 
meant "green" more than "blue" anyway -- this is reflected in the "seishun" 
word and explains why we are talking about "blue spring" instead of &nbsp;the 
more reasonable "green spring".) &nbsp;Anyway, she needed a cute English version
for  her "blue-green period of time" title, so she probably picked the shortest
English words which corresponded in her dictionary to Mizuiro and Jidai,
and those short words are "Aqua" and "Age." So that became her cute English
equivalent. Small is cute.  Small fits in the margins. Why did Ciao Magazine
need an English title in the first place?&nbsp; Not for the anime, that's
for sure... this was years earlier than the anime.&nbsp; It was for their
merchandise.&nbsp; The tiny plastic purses, the stationery... things that
need a small title, not a long one.&nbsp; "Aqua" was the shortest English
word they could find for "mizuiro".&nbsp; It didn't need to make much sense.
  </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it came time for us to pick a fansub title, 
 there was a big problem because kanji puns just don't translate.  But by
 a cosmic coincidence, the word "blue" in English can mean "moody" and "green"
 can mean "inexperienced" and the two  words seemed to me to be the perfect
 way to  describe the teen years, and since they were so close to "blue-green
 spring." I thought  they were a great choice and Anna liked it  too, so
that  was that.  </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So then, a lot of criticism was heard from US
 anime fans who knew that the phrase "Aqua Age" had appeared in the manga
margins and even popped up at one point on a sign in the manga.  They all
assumed that it was the correct translation for "Mizuiro Jidai".  To me,
it was obvious that it wasn't, but explaining didn't do anything to slow
down the talk in the newsgroups where those fans who "really knew the whole
story" always made sure they referred to the anime (and the fansub!) as "Aqua
Age."            </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there was more.  Anime fans always are learning 
Japanese, and a lot of them knew that "mizu" meant "water". They didn't understand 
why "mizuiro" was in the title, so they started looking for translations that
stressed the "water" aspect, like  "watercolor".  But the idea of "water" 
was never part of the original kanji pun.  Attempts to  twist the title in 
that direction were WAY off track.  </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aren't kanji puns fun?<br>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So that's the story of the title.&nbsp;&nbsp; I honestly 
feel that of all the possible translations, "Aqua Age" loses all of the original 
connotations, and is in fact almost completely meaningless  in English. It 
doesn't work!&nbsp; There may be other possibilities than "Blue-Green Years"&nbsp; 
(our second choice was "Our Blue Years") but "Aqua Age" is NOT one of them. 
 </p>
        <p>&nbsp; The only word that is really indeterminate is the "jidai".&nbsp;
If we had wanted to make the fansub with a TOTALLY literal title, we would
have used "BlueGreen Spring".&nbsp; If we had done that, the Japanese speaking
fans would have said "Aha, you understood the pun." but the American fans
would have said, "You arrogant fansubbers have no idea what the title really
means and we resent you making  up your own stupid title."&nbsp; So Anna
and I settled on "BlueGreen Years" as  being reasonable, though still as
literal as possible.&nbsp; And we thought it added an extra level to the
pun in English. &nbsp;Using "Age" for "jidai" doesn't work  because it doesn't
relate to the nostalgia theme.&nbsp; In English, one needs  to express it
in a nostalgic way, like "Those days" or "Back then" or "old  times".&nbsp;
"Age", "epoch", "dynasty" etc are all dictionary words for "jidai" that don't
fit.&nbsp; That's a different usage of jidai, more like in a historical sense.
There are other translations for "jidai" which work better. &nbsp;I think
the best expression of the feeling of the title is in the lyrics of the closing
song, "Ano Koro no You ni".&nbsp; ("Just like way back then" or "The way
it was then" or maybe "Those were the days".)&nbsp; In the song, one sees
that "jidai" is in the sense of "ano koro".&nbsp; So one has to use the personal
way of translating it, like "years" "days" or "times".                  
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you prefer to think of the manga title as meaning
 "Aqua Age" that's OK.&nbsp; However, the English title we gave for the English-subtitled 
 fansub we made from it was "The Blue-Green Years".&nbsp;&nbsp; We'd prefer 
 that you use that title when talking about our fansub or listing it. </p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barbara, I would just like to thank you and
 the rest of the Techno Girls gang for a job much more than well done.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 I absolutely LOVED The Blue-Green Years (as soon as you need sponsors for 
 future episodes, just let me know ---this one certainly deserves my support).&nbsp; 
 I fell in love with it after the first three minutes.&nbsp; It took me back
 to when I was that age.&nbsp; I have to say that this is one of my top 5
favorite anime series.&nbsp;&nbsp; (D.S.) </p>
        <center>=============</center>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I definitely want to see this series subbed and I thank 
 you so much for doing it :)&nbsp; (D.S.)                   
        <center>=============</center>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just watched those Mizuiro #5-8 you gave me, and
I must say that they're AWESOME...&nbsp;&nbsp; I would love to get more from 
you.&nbsp; (A.E.)                   
        <center>=============</center>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, I would like to thank the Techno-Girls 
for subbing The Blue Green Years (Mizuiro Jidai).&nbsp; It's an excellent 
title that I would like to see more of.&nbsp; (V.C.)                   
        <center>=============</center>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I'd write and give you my input now that
I've  seen your subs of it.&nbsp; From its looks, I was expecting a wild
"kawaii"  show and so I was taken off-guard at its methodical pace and unusually
serious  mood (for such young kids).&nbsp; It took me until about the 4th
episode to really warm up to this show, but now that I have I would really
like to see more.&nbsp; I liked your large fonts and the way you provide
transcriptions  of the original japanese and the translations during the
songs.&nbsp; Thanks  very much for all your work!&nbsp; (S.F.)           
       
        <center>=============</center>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've finally seen it yesterday, and I am very happy 
to have contributed to the translation.&nbsp; It's very charming.&nbsp; I 
was a little wary after the first two episodes, but was hooked by the time 
the camping trip and softball friendship episodes came on.&nbsp; I must also
 congratulate you on how well the grocery store tapes transferred over (due
 to the great VCR you were using)&nbsp; I am now extremely interested in
the  Panasonic AG-1980 and have started budgeting for it.&nbsp; Anyway, thanks
 for the shows and keep up the good work.&nbsp; (J.G.)                  
        <center>=============</center>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We finally got a copy of Blue Green Years 1-4 and wanted 
 to tell you how much we like it. We like it an awful lot actually. The art
 style gave an initial impression that the series would be trivial and lightweight,
 but by the end of the 2nd ep. it becomes clear that the writing is very
sensitively  done, very "right". We are looking forward to seeing the characters
unfold,  it seems like they will be interesting and not just stereotypes.
Thank you  so much for doing 1-4. If you ever feel that you might like to
try to do further fansubbing of this series we would like to send a donation
to help. In any case thank you for all the work you have done so far on all
your projects.  It has benefited all of us anime fans.&nbsp; (E.D.)     
             
        <center>=============</center>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've just received my copies of Blue-Green Years 
 and would like to comment on it.&nbsp; This is my first "serious" drama anime
and I loved it!!!&nbsp; Everything that is said about the show in your webpage
is true.&nbsp; It's a show about friendship and about growing up.&nbsp; It's
unfortunate that this show isn't that popular in Japan.&nbsp; I've seen anime
that is so awful that I'm surprised that they were able to spawn several
 LDs or even reach to the North American shores!!!&nbsp; And to have a beautiful
 story like Blue-Green Years go out unnoticed.... I consider it a sin!!&nbsp;
 I'm glad that Techno Girls are handling this project.&nbsp; Thank you for
 the job well done.&nbsp; (A.C.)

        <b><font color="#993300"><font size="+3">Reviews Reviewed</font></font></b></p>
        </center>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sci-Fi Channel created the web entity "Animecolony"
 and <a href="http://www.scifi.com/anime/anime.cgi?25582">reviewed</a>
   our fansubs of the show.  They "rated" it as a "D+".   A single reviewer
 does not make a consensus thankfully, especially this one.  Zac Bertschy
obviously did not like the show.  If he actually did watch all of episodes
1-12, then I have to give him credit.  But his review is mindful of the confused
mumblings one sees when the reviewer did not like the show but can't give
convincing reasons why.  Such a  review often descends into a cataloguing
exercise.  You've seen such reviews before: they explain that the movie (making
up an example here) lacked (1) any murders, (2) sex, (3) chase scenes, (4)
big explosions, etc. etc.  Then they try to make the reader believe that
the show suffers from what it lacks.  This is what we see in negative reviews
 of many great films, such as "Glengarry Glen Ross" -- the reader is left
with the impression that the feature is dull and a complete waste of time,
whereas in fact the feature is a masterpiece with a narrow focus.  Now I'm
the first to admit that some of Zac's points were fairly put, but his complete
disconnection from the CHARM of the show has to disqualify him from an ability
to appreciate the show's positive aspects.  Yes, there are no robot girls,
no aliens, no magic, no violence, no spaceships, no martial arts... and that's
the whole point.  This is the story of the girl next door, and it is meant
to be nostalgic and remind us of our own youth.  This reviewer is too used
to escapist anime, and can't relate to natsukashii (nostalgic) anime.  Like
"The Wonder Years" which got variable reviews too, "The BlueGreen Years"
is an intimate and low key look at the memories of our youth.  It is crafted
to draw us into its narrative and make us love the characters, and identify
with them.  For those that the show succeeds in doing so, the show is a precious
masterpiece that we wish there were more of;  for those that the show fails
in doing so, the show is a waste of time.  This reviewer should have sensed
that he fell into the latter group.  It would habe been better to give the
review to a different person to do instead of trying to make sense of his
own negative feelings in a logical way.  When will the "anime experts" realize
that there are great animes which appeal to a small audience?  Is it an American
foible that we feel that quality is only measured by mass appeal?       
             
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a key point in his explanation of the things
 he felt were lacking from Mizuirojidai, Zac begins listing shoujo shows,
saying: "But even <i>To Heart</i> had a robot girl..."  Does he he consider
"To Heart" to be a shoujo show?  "To Heart" is a shounen dating-romance anime
based on an outright hentai (porn) simulation game.  It's about as far from
"shoujo" as one can get.  Another clue that he might have done better to
hand these tapes to Danielle Perreault or Shu-Chun Lin to review.  There's
more, though. Look at the <a href="http://www.scifi.com/anime/genre.cgi?160">
 genre</a>
   category on the Sci-Fi website.  They mistakenly listed these shows as 
shoujo: (1) "Bewitching Nozomi" (except they mispelled it as "Nazomi" on their
website AND in the listing they put on Anipike.), and (2) "Graduation". 
Neither of them are shoujo anime.  Those are fairly embarrassing mistakes 
for a website which wants to become a fan resource. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Sci-Fi channel doesn't give any links
off their site, of course.  They want you to stay and watch their banner
advertisements, so it would be an economic mistake for them to put a link
to someone else's site.  If you're looking for a place to get information
about anime shows, start at <a href="http://www.anipike.com">Anipike</a>
   instead. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing I liked best about the review was
that the anime was listed by all of the titles it is known by: "Mizuirojidai",
 "The BlueGreen Years", and "Aqua Age".  The thing I liked least is that
it  didn't provide much incentive to those who would love the show to take
a chance and watch it.  Read the positive comments <a href="#comments">on
this page</a>
   to see the other side of the story. </p>

   the existing fansubs and gave it a favorable rating.  In this review,
the  reviewer notices and comments on the unique aspects of the series. He
 comments  on the layout and content of the fansub, which is unusual.  And
he even  tries to express the "feeling" of each song.  This is a splendid
approach  to an anime review.  Please take a look. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In yet another <a href="http://anime.mikomi.org/series/Mizuiro%20Jidai">
  review</a>
  , at Anime Mikomi, the series is once again compared to the shounen romance
 "To Heart".   Unfortunately, this sort of  comparison will sometimes occur
 when the reviewer hasn't seen a great deal of anime. This reviewer thought
 that something from "To Heart" was related to "Mizuirojidai" because of
the  opening scene, one in which a pan accross Yuuko's bedroom ends with
a closeup  of her at the moment her alarm clock goes off on the first day
of the new  school year.  But this is a classic and formulaic shoujo introduction,
so  much so that it has been parodied thoroughly -- even to the extent of
including  the identical scene in "Project A-Ko", for instance. Volume 1
issue 1 of many shoujo manga use such a scene as the perfect place to start,
because the first day of school is one that most people remember as they
grow older, and so it is a nostalgic point.  It certainly doesn't mean that
"Mizuirojidai"  has anything to do with "To Heart."  The rest of the  review,
however, is  detailed, written with care, and useful to the reader. <br>

  analysis and summary</a>
   of the show -- written solely in French.&nbsp; Barbara decided to translate
 the original text, and her translation of the "critique" section appears
below, with apologies for the clumsiness of the translation.&nbsp; There
are a few spoilers in the text below, but due to the introspective nature
of the show, they do little harm to the suspense.&nbsp; (Barbara's comments
are in parentheses. And in a few cases, general terms are replaced with specific
ones, as permitted by the original text.):                   
        <dl>
        <dd><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mizuirojidai" is pure soap opera,
 and a very pleasant one if you are not allergic to the genre. One is reminded
 of "Kimagure Orange Road" or even "Maison Ikkoku" -- but this time, it is
 the girl in the role of the anti-hero, while the boy is idealized.&nbsp;
"Mizuirojidai" retains a serious tone throughout: it has no magic powers
nor any malevolent villains.&nbsp; This anime does not need any.&nbsp; A
lighthearted tone is adopted, such as is common to shoujo manga, with a&nbsp;
good amount of humor but without falling to the level of a burlesque.</font></dd>
          <dd><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp; The story begins with very simple
 topics, suggested by special events like Christmas, New Year's Day, Valentine's
 Day, summer vacation, festivals, and graduation day.&nbsp; It not only deals
 with the relation between Yuuko and Hiroshi but also with all of Yuuko's
relationships, beginning with herself alone, and then with her teachers,
friends, and family.&nbsp; More than one third of the episodes relate to
problems of her friends such as Takako and Miyuki.</font></dd>
            <dd><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp; The development of Hiroshi and 
Yuuko as a couple is rather unusual.&nbsp; At the beginning, the situation
 is similar to that between Ami and Junta in DNA2.&nbsp; The windows of the
 two characters' rooms are opposite one another.&nbsp; Instead of using it
 to heighten the suspense later, Hiroshi's declaration of love occurs at
the  very beginning of the series.&nbsp; There is still suspense though,
due to  the other girls around Hiroshi.&nbsp; The essence of the show is
the evolution  of the various characters and the development of their feelings.&nbsp;
Although  love triangles do appear, they don't seem to endure.&nbsp; Takako
does not  interfere except as a friend once Hiroshi has declared his feelings
for Yuuko  and we do not know about Natsumi yet.</font></dd>
              <dd><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp; Since everything is shown
 from the viewpoint of Yuuko herself, we see only her assumptions and worries.&nbsp;
 Yuuko seldom speaks to Natsumi and never has a direct confrontation: its
only a matter of her own jealousy.&nbsp; Once the diplomas are given out,
Natsumi greets Hiroshi and Yuuko, then does not reappear again in the series.
This is rather surprising.&nbsp; At the same time, other boys are interested
 in Yuuko but she hardly pays any attention to them, though they remain in
her circle of friends.</font></dd>
                <dd><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The series covers
 a little more than three years in the life of Yuuko. It deals with her middle
 school years as well as her first steps in high school, before accelerating
 the pace in order to end with admission to a university.&nbsp; Only the
first  episodes are connected to each other; the others</font><font size="-1">
being  independent stories for various key</font><font size="-1">moments
of the  year such as festivals or holidays.&nbsp; The ending of the anime
is less  abrupt than that of the manga. At the end of middle school, Hiroshi
chooses  a distant high school -- which of course causes quite a problem
for Yuuko.&nbsp;  In the</font><font size="-1">manga, once Hiroshi goes to
his high school,  the story jumps to the point of attending the university.&nbsp;
On the other  hand, there are several</font><font size="-1">chapters in the
manga covering  years that Yuuko and Hiroshi passed together in elementary
school which are  not referred to in the anime at all..</font><font size="-1">
The anime devotes  extra time to the first weeks of separation, when Yuuko
and Hiroshi are attending  two different high schools. The main story line,
interestingly, finally stops  at the thirty ninth episode. <i>(BC: actually,
episode 38)&nbsp; </i>The last chapters consist of retrospectives on each
character. They are as much reviews as they are new material, especially
with regard to Miyuki's birthday.&nbsp;  They are</font><font size="-1">interesting
for those who missed some episodes  but aren't adequate to completely reconstruct
the story.</font></dd>
                  <dd><font size="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to the animation
 and drawing, Mizuirojidai is properly done, homogeneous, and with beautiful
 artwork, despite the lack of fantasy.&nbsp; In fact, it surpasses the first
 series of Sailormoon (and not only the first series, either! ^_^).&nbsp;
The style of the series is faithful to the manga but the stories are better
developed in the anime.&nbsp; As for the first ending theme, "Ano Koro No
You Ni", it comes across very well. It is interesting to note that the transitional
 episode between the two parts of the series <i>(BC: episode 39)</i>, consists
 entirely of music clips.&nbsp; These songs are available on the CD "Present
 - Character Song Collection" along with the credits. Our only regret is
being  unable to obtain the series.&nbsp; Unlike the other animes which were
running  concurrently at that time such as "Saint Tail", "Akachan to Boku"
or "Hamelin  No Violin-hiki", no episodes of Mizuirojidai were released on
video.&nbsp;  Lacking them, one might be persuaded to resort to the manga
itself, which  is very easy to understand, even for beginning students of
Japanese.</font></dd>
