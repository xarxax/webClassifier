Langston'schildhood was spent in the care of friends and relatives throughoutthe midwest and northeast. He moved frequently and feltabandoned.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In an attempt to deal with his loneliness,Langston began to write poetry. He was a frequent visitor to thelocal library. Langston believed in books more thanpeople.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">While attending high school, Langston wasactive in many extra curricular activities including the schoolmagazine. Many of his published poems showed the influence of hisfavorite poets, Carl Sandburg and Walt Whitman. The themes were oftenof social injustices and what it meant to be black.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Realizing he couldn't depend on his parentsfor financial support, he began to work and save his money forcollege. He published his first poem in <I>Brownies Book</I>, a newmagazine for black children. Soon <I>Crisis</I>, a companion magazinewhich targeted black adults, published several of hispoems.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><I>Crisis</I> was published by the NationalAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). It was aforum for blacks to share their struggles. The editors were JessieFauset and W. E. B. Du Bois. Both were among a growing number ofblack artists and intellectuals in Harlem, New York. Langstonestablished his position in the group before arriving in Harlem fromMexico.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Harlem in the 1920s was the largest and mostinfluential black community in the United States. Intelligences andthe arts were the focus of change, often referred to as the HarlemRenaissance. Concerts, lectures and black only private clubs invitedAfrican Americans to migrate to Harlem.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Hughes finally arrived in New York onSeptember 4, 1921 to attend Columbia University. Langston feltfrustrated at Columbia due to the coolness of his white peers. Hisgrades began to suffer and finally he quit and looked for ajob.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Jobs were still hard to come by for mostblacks. He longed to work on a ship that would sail abroad. Aftermuch persistence, he headed to Africa on a freighter. Hughes wasdisturbed by the African tribes' lack of political and economicalfreedom. The Africans considered him white because of his brown skinand straight dark hair. It was here that he met a mulatto child whowas ignored by the Africans and the whites. This was a source ofinspiration for his play, "Mulatto."</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Hughes found work on another freighter andended up in Paris. While there he worked at a night club thatfeatured southern cooking and Jazz performers. While moving on toItaly, Hughes was robbed and left stranded wanting to return to theUnited States. He tried to get a job on a ship headed for the U.S.A.,but was told they only hired whites. In this depressed state of mindhe wrote, "I, Too, Sing America."</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">He returned to America and found the HarlemRenaissance was spreading across racial boundaries. Many black poetsand authors were now published in mainstream publications. Hughes waswarmly welcomed by his peers and recognized for the poetry he wrotewhile traveling.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Hughes began to expand his writing to plays,short stories, articles, essays and an autobiography. Jesse Semple(nicknamed "Simple") became a familiar character in his short storieswhich appealed to his black audience. Most people liked the way"Simple" dealt with racism using humor, honesty anddetermination.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In 1927, Hughes loaded his car with booksand headed to the south for a poetry reading tour. This tour was tobe the first of many. He had never seen the south and hoped it wouldhelp him relate to his southern black audience. His writing became asource of inspiration for blacks who lived in the most racially tensearea of the country. While on tour he was scorned by whites for beinga troublemaker.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Hughes realized the importance of educationand received his degree from Lincoln University in 1929. As the GreatDepression started, Hughes felt the financial impact along with therest of the country.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Langston became interested in socialismduring his youth. His belief that all property should be dividedequally among society lead him to join the Communist party. In 1932,he went to the Soviet Union as part of a team of writers to produce adocumentary. He admired the Soviet Union and saw it as a symbol ofhope. Though the country was poor and struggling, Hughes noticedthere was no racism or economic divisions. He wrote the poem "OneMore 'S' in the U. S. A." for the U. S. Communist party in 1934. Inlater years, his involvement with the Communist party brought himbefore the McCarthy Committee which was investigating the influenceof communism in the United States. This was during a time ofnationwide anti-communist hysteria (The Cold War). Hughes made a dealwith the committee and no charges were ever filed. But the experiencebrought his character into question.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><A NAME="jim crow"></A>During World War IIin 1942, Hughes was called to serve on the Writers War Board. Hugheswrote jingles to inspire the troops as well as to fight segregationsuch as, "Looks like by now, Folks ought to know, It's hard to beatHitler, Protecting Jim Crow." Because of this publicity, Hughesbecame a familiar name in many American households.</FONT> (<A HREF="#6">Returnto Activity 6</A>)</P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Because of Hughes extensive travelsoverseas, he became a cultural emissary to Europe and Africa for theU.S. State Department from 1960 through 1963.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Langston Hughes died on May 22, 1967 in NewYork City, but his words still inspire each generation. The lives heaffected with his words could never be numbered. He brought hope toAfrican Americans and encouraged tolerance and understanding fromwhites. He blazed a trail for future black poets and earned the titleof "The Black Poet Laureate."</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><HR><B>References</B>:</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Hughes, Langston.

Theclass will discuss the similarities and differences between the musicand the poem (draw two large overlapping circles, label one "blues,"the other "Hughes," and the overlapping area "both"). Writesimilarities and differences under the appropriate labels. Discusshow Langston was influenced by music. How was dialect used? Why washe called "The Jazz Poet?"</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><A NAME=2></A>2.<B>Think-Pair-Share</B>-Give each student a copy of the poem "I, Too,Sing America: along with questions</FONT> (<A HREF="#Activity 2">seeAppendix</A>). <FONT COLOR="#000000">Students will answer questionsindividually and then discuss in pairs. Pairs will share theiranswers with the whole class. Extend by having students write a poemabout an issue that bothers them.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">3. <B>Role Playing</B>-Read a short storyabout Jesse Semple (use "Jim Crow's Funeral" found in<I> The LangstonHughes Reader </I>). Discuss how Hughes described black life. Placestudents in cooperative groups and instruct them to write and act outa short story using the character Jesse Semple and Hughes' style(dialect, honesty, humor, etc.). For more structure, the teacher canprovide the setting and the problem (e.g. not being allowed to eat inan all white restaurant or being denied a job because he is black).Give each group a different problem and have them perform their finalproduct for the whole class. Why do they think the short storiesabout Jesse Semple were a favorite among the blacks?</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><A NAME=4></A>4. <B>Mapping</B>-Give eachstudent a map of the world and the description of Hughes' travels</FONT>(<A HREF="#Activity 4">see Appendix</A>).<FONT COLOR="#000000">Students should mark each country he traveledto with a symbol (star, ciricle, etc.) and briefly describe thecontributions made to his writing (i.e. Africa="Mulatto",France=jazz, Italy="I, Too, Sing America", The Soviet Union="One More'S' in the U. S. A.", Cuba=musicals).</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">5. <B>Choral Reading</B>-Use the Hughes'poems "Harlem" and "Children's Rhymes" (found in <I>The LangstonHughes Reader</I> ) . Depending on the number of students involved,teacher should divide the poems into parts to be read by all andparts to be read by small groups. The teacher should read each poemaloud and then assign parts. Good choral reading will take practice.Encourage students to speak with feeling and emotion. After readingin choral fashion, discuss what each poem meant. How did each poemmake them feel? Why did he use dialect in "Children's Rhymes?" Whatwas Hughes trying to say?</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><A NAME=6></A>6. <B>CooperativeLearning</B>-After discussing Hughes' work on the Writers WarBoard</FONT> (<A HREF="#jim crow">share Jim Crow Jingle found inbackground</A>)<FONT COLOR="#000000">, have groups make up a jinglethat reflects the patriotism of African Americans during World WarII. Extend by having groups create a poster to advertise theirjingle.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">7. <B>Learning Journal</B>- Students willwrite at least one important thing they learn about Langston Hughesafter each activity. This is an opportunity for students to reflecton learning and make connections.

Write a brief description by the markerof how each country influenced him.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">After Langston dropped out of ColumbiaUniversity, he worked on a freighter that sailed for Africa. Whilethere he was deeply concerned about the African tribes' lack ofpolitical and economical freedom. He met a mulatto child who wasignored by the Africans because his one of his parents was white andthe other was black. The child asked him if it was true that Americanpeople talked to mulattos. This encounter was an inspiration for hisplay, "Mulatto."</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">His next job was on a freighter that dockedin France. He stayed and worked at a night club that featuredsouthern cooking and jazz performers. Night after night, he listenedto the rhythms of the bands and used them in his poetry.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Moving on to Italy, Langston was robbed on atrain. Without any money, he desperately longed to return to theUnited States. He tried to return to the U. S. A. on a freighter, butwas denied because he was black. In this depressed state of mind hewrote, "I, Too, Sing America." Eventually he found an all black shipwilling to take him to the United States.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Hughes next trip lead him to Cuba and Haiti.He was looking for someone to help him write a folk opera (a singingplay). He met some Cuban poets who were also using their nativerhythms in their poetry. He decided to use some Latin music in hisnext musical.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Because of his interest in Communism, Hughesgladly accepted and offer to visit the Soviet Union and help write adocumentary. He was impressed by the lack of racism and wrote thepoem "One More 'S' in the U. S. A." This trip increased his interestin the U. S. Communist party.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Because of his experiences in othercountries, Hughes became a cultural emissary to Europe and Africa forthe U.S. State Department from 1960 to 1963.
