     COLOR="#990000" FACE="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">t begins
    with the awakening of the real Big Fire (aka Babel II). What
    has to be the entire BF organization is waiting for him as he
    finally appears to lead them again in the most regal looking
    threads I've ever seen. Neow. Everybody then gives a &quot;Big
    Fire&quot; salute (chilling to say the least!). Almost in the
    background there is a BF agent who has noticably &quot;amoeba-like&quot;
    hair. He smiles in a wicked way.<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;We then flash to the Experts of Justice (or what
    is left of them). Most of their major HQs have been destroyed,
    so most of them have now located themselves in one of their smaller
    bases in Hong Kong. To make a long story short (episode VIII
    was about an hour and a half long): We find out that the Tower
    of Babel (the ultimate weapon and source of all ESPers' powers
    on the planet) is hidden under Big Fire's base. This is where
    Big Fire (Babel II) had been in hibernation. It seems that the
    BF organization needed their leader in synch with the tower in
    order to use it to their advantage and wipe out the Experts of
    Justice and then control the world!</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" FACE="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless
    to say, the Experts don't think that this is a good idea. Murasame
    Kenji (who, it is stated rather matter of factly, had come back
    to life once again after the Eye of Vogler incident ^_~, and
    infultrated the Big Fire ranks) escapes the BF base by the skin
    of his teeth (Holy cow! What an action sequence!!) and is able
    to report back to Chief Chujo in Hong Kong base about the goings
    on. It was what they feared the most, but also what they had
    prepared for as the rest of the Nine Celestial Kings of Heaven
    had secretly gathered for the final blow to Big Fire.... They
    had to hurry though, as the ceremony to control the Tower was
    soon to begin.</FONT></P>

    most of the world's Shizuma Drives were out of the picture and
    also because none of InterPol's large transports were still functional,
    Daisaku offered to fly the Celestial Nine to BF's HeadQuarters
    on Giant Robo. After being told that this was not a revenge mission
    for his father or Ginrei, Daisaku nodded slowly and when he looked
    back up at Chujo and Koshin we could see Professor Kusama's face
    (Daisaku's father) for a brief moment. They all grimly smile
    and agree. <I>Operation Siege of Babel </I>was about to begin.</FONT></P>

    HeadQuarters, Komei invites all of the remaining Magnificent
    Ten to a Tea Ceremony and informs them that the Experts of Justice
    are on their way and that this is to be the last battle. He then
    begins to laugh as the rest of the Mag Ten look at him and wonder
    if his head is truly screwed on right. The curious thing is that
    even Ko-Enshaku appears to be a little uneasy.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" FACE="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocketing
    towards Big Fire, we can see Giant Robo (fully restored) loaded
    with Experts. But most importantly we notice that the (remaining)
    Celestial Nine are standing proud and strong on top of Robo's
    head and shoulders as if the speed and wind did not affect them.
    Among them were Tendou the Berserker, Director Eigan, Chujo the
    Silent, Chief Ootsuka, Dick the Shepherd, Marshal Kanshin, Lord
    Rinchuu the Panther Cub-Headed and Sei the Bewitcher (Taisou
    the Spiritual Buddhist is already extinct [and noone else had
    been promoted yet to replace him :-( . They are all slightly
    smiling.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" FACE="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Back
    at the BF stable we can see that they are preparing for an attack,
    and from their preparations they expect worse than we can imagine.
    Search lights are zooming around the night sky and BF Agents
    are everywhere with scared but determined looks on their masked
    faces. Deep inside the catecombs beneath the HQ, the Magnificent
    Ten march behind Big Fire as they approach the Giant Tower. They
    then stop at the entrance while Komei and the head cheese continue
    forward. Hanzui turns to the BF Agents around them and orders
    them to guard the Tower and Big Fire with their lives. &quot;Even
    if they have no choice but to throw their own bodies against
    the Experts of Justice they must not let them get near the Tower!&quot;
    Then the Mag Ten turn around and head back towards the surface.
    Ko-Enshaku silently appears out of the shadows and hides behind
    one of the pillars surrounding the Tower.</FONT></P>

    the Tower Komei has Big Fire sit in an oversized and richly decorated
    thrown and <I>orders</I> him to concentrate. He begins to chastise
    the small leader for his lack of will when he draws his fan to
    cover his mouth and becomes eerily still. He quietly whispers
    &quot;It's too late&quot;.<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Outside, everything goes silent. There is something
    in the air but neither the Mag Ten or the hooded subordinates
    can tell what is about to happen. Then somebody yells &quot;There!
    In front of the moon!&quot; and we can see an enormous black
    mass getting larger and larger. There is the sound of super rockets
    firing their exhaust too. But before any action can be taken,
    a &quot;hiss&quot;-like sound grows louder and sharper and a
    second later the entire area is plastered with arrows. A whole
    lot of BF guys go down, but the Mag Ten stand firm. We see flashes
    of all of their placid faces... except for Doki the Direct. He
    whispers that revenge for his warrior clan will be his and launches
    a personal attack upon the incoming Experts. He is the first
    to go down.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" FACE="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Doki
    gets literally blown away by Chujo's rocket punch in mid air!
    It was sooooooo cool to see that^_^. Then the rest of the Celestials
    land behind the Silent one and stare into the eyes of their oponents.
    Giant Robo blasts past them still flying in the sky, and then
    the ultimate battle begins! Now, there is no way to describe
    just <I>how</I> &quot;ultimate&quot; and cut ass rugged this
    mini-war between the Celestial Nine and the Magnificent Ten is!!!
    Back and forth the volley of energy projectiles and bodies fly!
    Many a great man is wounded on both sides and Jujoji and Chief
    Ootsuka both fall.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" FACE="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Komei
    is watching the battle through a flame that hovers over his Chinese
    fan. He finally starts to get worried. The Strategist turns his
    eyes to the child in the throne and a snarl appears on his face.
    He starts to talk (but in a very loud and angry voice) to Big
    Fire and explain why his full cooperation is indeed necessary
    to rid the world of the evil that is the Experts of Justice.
    &quot;Their powers must be vanquished!&quot; It is at that moment
    that the ceiling of the cavern caves in and the Giant Egypian
    Main Man himself comes crashing down. The whole underground complex
    shakes with the force, but miraculously the hollowed out grotto
    stays in shape and doesn't collapse. Now Daisaku, Tetsegyu, Issei
    and Murasame appear on Robo's shoulders and look around the huge
    undergroung lair. Just as Murasame tells them all to be careful,
    Neptune (one of Babel II's guardians in the form of a giant robot)
    walks out from behind the tower to face Robo. An ear-piercing
    screech is heard from behind the Experts and they turn to find
    Galuda, the giant flying reptile (guardian number II). The four
    Experts jump off Robo just as Galuda flies right at him, but
    all Robo does is swing his massive left arm into the bird-creature's
    face and smash it into its body. One guardian down.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" FACE="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;The
    battle outside is still waging, but it's at a draw. Both sides

    <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" FACE="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;In
    the underground cavern, the four Experts run towards the entrance
    to the Tower when all of a sudden a black oil seeps up from the
    ground and Achilles (the final guardian of Babel II) takes his
    physical form of the giant black cat. It jumps at the heroes,
    but Tetsegyu tackles it to the ground and starts pounding it
    (in what appears to be a vain attempt) to knock it out. He tells
    the others to go on without him and to stop Big Fire. Murasame
    and Daisaku do (Issei turns around to help his fallen comrade
    and blasts the cat off of the big guy with one of his energy
    snakes). In the background Robo and Neptune are slugging it out.</FONT></P>

    his fan when all of a sudden a cold voice calls out &quot;Stop!&quot;
    and the Strategist finds that he cannot move his body himself.
    Fear is frozen on his face as Ko-Enshaku emerges from the shadows
    on the far side of the throne room. He stares at the unmoving
    Komei for an eternity before raising his cape and reveiling the
    real BIG FIRE! Komei's eyes go even wider in terror as he struggles
    to understand what is going on.</FONT></P>

    outside of the Tower's entrance, Murasame Kenji and Daisaku Kusama
    are about to enter when all of a sudden tons of Big Fire Agents
    pile out of the immense doorway and form a giant wall to block
    them. Without missing a beat, Murasame pushes Daisaku to the
    ground and runs at the human wall with a look of satisfaction
    and death in his eye. Just as he is about ten feet away he pulls
    out a palm-sized detonator from his pocket and his trenchcoat
    blows open so we can see that he is covered with plastic explosives.
    Daisaku covers his head with his hands as the human wall jumps
    down upon the pink Expert. Just as they all land, a flash of
    light goes off in the center of the pile and bodies go flying
    everywhere. The boy then looks up at Robo's fight with Neptune
    (both are badly dented, Neptune is missing a horn and a chunk
    out of Robo's right shoulder is gone too). Tetsegyu and Issei
    come running up behind him (Tetsegyu holding a bleeding bite
    mark on his neck and in the background we can see the crumpled
    form of Achilles) and the Black Ox picks him up and carries him
    inside the Tower. Daisaku has just enough time to order Robo
    to &quot;Crush Neptune now!&quot; before they disappear into
    the shadows of the spiraling structure. In the forground a pink
    fedora (half charred) lightly descends to the ground.</FONT></P>

    throne room, Ko-Enshaku and the real Big Fire approach Hanzui.
    Big Fire looks up to the frightened and frozen man with clear
    grey eyes and asks him how he thought he could accomplish this
    insane mission without BF's support. All the while Ko-Enshaku
    picks up the imposter Big Fire from the throne and takes off
    the disguise revealing Sunny the Magician in a trance (*You wouldn't
    have thought that Komei would fall for his own trick, huh?*).
    Big Fire then slowly walks to and sits down in the throne himself
    as Ko-Enshaku bows and takes his leave. The child turns to the
    Strategist and in a matter-of-fact tone informs him that global
    domination and the subjigation of the Nine Celestial Kings was
    never the plan and he knew it. He went on to say that there was
    now only one way to stop the senseless destruction that Komei
    had brought upon the world. He then closed his eyes and consentrated.
    Komei became free from the spell and began to scream as a bright
    light enveloped the room and everything in it.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" FACE="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside
    the Tower the light grew and grew. It touched and surrounded
    the two fighting giants and before everything goes to pure white
    we can see one of them fall.<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;In the night air, high above the Tower, the fight
    is almost over. Soon it appears that both sides will destroy
    eachother. At that moment, both the BF agents and the Experts
    turn to see the piercing white light shoot up from the hole in
    the ground that Robo had drilled. It then grows and sucks in
    the entire battlefield. Nobody tries to escape.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#990000" FACE="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;In
    a matter of moments the light grows dimmer and soon fades away
    to darkness again. As soon as he becomes used to the dark again,
    Mask the Red takes the advantage of the confusion and launches
    an attack on Dick the Shepherd. Unable to react with any real
    defense in time the Shepherd just reflexively throws a punch
    (kinda like Chujo ^_~) not expecting it to do much damage....
    but it does! Red goes flying backwards and lands pretty far in
    the distance, not moving. The Magnificent Ten look at eachother
    in shock before turning their attention towards the Celestial
    ones. An aora of blue then surrounds the Experts as the BF guys
    begin to retreat. It is no use though, as the remaining Nine
    jump into the air and land in the middle of the retreat with
    a big explosion!</FONT></P>

    time, we find Daisaku and gang fast approaching the throne room
    in the center of the Tower of Babel. They rush in to see Komei
    cowering at the feet of the child (Big Fire) sobbing how he meant
    all of this for the glory of BF. Big Fire frowns and looks up
    at the intruders. Tetsegyu jumps in front of Daisaku and Issei
    and throws his two axes at the boy and Komei, but they are blocked
    by an invisible barrier and impale themselves into the floor.
    Big Fire then begins to glow himself and lift into the air. He
    tells the Experts that Big Fire is finished and that they have
    nothing left to fear, then he disappears in a flash of light.
    Just then, the giant fist of Robo punches through the ceiling
    and grabs Komei in its grip, but Komei was already dead. His
    eyes frozen open in fright.</FONT></P>

    outside of the Tower, Hanzui falls through the hole in the ceiling
    into the subterranean lair and can see GR standing over Babel
    with his back to him. He then notices all the dead BF Agents
    and the fallen Neptune, Galuda and Achilles. As fast as he can,
    eithout his ESPer powers, he runs to the entrance of the building
    while trying not to be seen by Robo. Just as he reaches the doorway,
    he stops and tries to catch his breath while Ko-Enshaku emerges
    from the shadows. Hanzui feels uneasy at first, but that goes
    away when it's revealed that the masked samurai is carrying Sunny
    underneath his cape. Without a word, he hands her over to the
    Chaos Lord and starts to walk away. Hanzui calls to him and he
    stops without turning around. He then asks the samurai if Big
    Fire had accomplished his goal. Ko-Enshaku nods. Hanzui goes
    on to ask if Komei had been taken care of and once again the
    silent one nods, but then he quickly disappears with a single
    jump leaving the two of them by themselves. Hanzui holds the
    girl close to him and heads off back towards the underground
    tunnel leading to BF's above ground palace and HeadQuarters with
    an expression of relief and guilt on his mug.</FONT></P>

    to investigate only to find Ko-Enshaku appear out of nowhere.
    Koshin reaches for his sword, but then thinks against it. He
    walks over to the masked samurai and asks if he's &quot;Finally
    found what he had been looking for?&quot; and if it was worth
    everything that he had sacrificed. Ko-Enshaku nods and in a hoarse
    whisper says, &quot;Yes.... I can rest now.&quot; Then the armor
    that was Ko-Enshaku falls to the ground in loud *clanks*. Koshin
    smiles to himself and says that life is all about truths that
    we find for ourselves, and not others' empty thoughts. The camera

    their hard earned victory amid the massive destruction that was
