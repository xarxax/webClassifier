<font size="+1"><p>A story a day in the month of May 2018:  a retrospective of some of my non-newspaper work timed to coincide with my first major sale of a fiction piece, which was published in May 1985. Every day in May 2018, I published an excerpt or an entirety of a work produced away from the day job from 1985 through 2018, roughly in chronological order, and with background as appropriate: short stories, books, screenplays, treatments and films. Some were previously published, others not. So some days, you could look into the trunk. 
Thirty-three years ago, #33Stories. A bit contrived, yes. A bit interesting, hopefully. Of course, May has 31 days. I published no. 32 on June 1, and no. 33 on June 12, a day of particular significance to me. <a href="http://gwaynemiller.blogspot.com/2018/04/starting-tomorrow-33stories.html">READ!
