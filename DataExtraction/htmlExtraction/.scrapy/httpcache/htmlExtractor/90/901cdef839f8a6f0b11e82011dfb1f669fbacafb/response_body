    <td width="453"><font color="#800000">I was reading a poem by W. S. Merwin in the New
    Yorker the other day<br>
    and as usual I was feeling pretty intimidated by all those long lines<br>
    he always writes and of course all the stuff that was going to be<br>
    in there about how things look in New England especially in the fall<br>
    and maybe even trout fishing and what it all means to the human soul on a<br>
    universal level because Fall in New England is always dynamic<br>
    and everywhere else is parochial but I decided to read his poem<br>
    anyway because I thought maybe I could just stand it<br>
    and he started in by talking about a barn door and some stones<br>
    on a hillside and an old man hoeing the dirt which seemed<br>
    allright to me even though it was as usual Fall in New England<br>
    because I really liked the imagery he made which is something<br>
    I always like because it puts pictures in my head even if I<br>
    am parochial and never even seen New England in the Fall when he<br>
    started in to saying as to how all this imagery really felt to him<br>
    which also meant how his personal feelings were all<br>
    about what the universal condition of man is and I got to <br>
    thinking about how glad I was I wasn't in some English<br>
    class again because those last five or six lines about universal<br>
    New England consciousness are always the ones your<br>
    freshman English instructor wants you to write a six page<br>
    double-spaced paper on and I hate it when that happens</font><p align="left"><font
