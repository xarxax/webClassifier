	We invite the world to follow the ranting of Lyle E Style on Twitter: @mrestyle



		 <p>



			If you’re looking to get married in Manitoba, consider doing it with Style. He’s been helping people live happily forever after for more than two decades.
			Besides music, writing and working in film/television, Lyle is a marriage commissioner based in Winnipeg and can accommodate weddings of all sizes
			(even at short notice). Email <a href="mailto:mrestyle@shaw.ca">mrestyle@shaw.ca</a> for more info.

		<p>

		Style has bought out all remaining inventory of his book "Ain’t Got No Cigarettes - Memories of Music Legend Roger Miller". There is still some time to get your
		signed copy <a href="http://electricrecordings.com/book.html">here</a>. Rumor has it he hasn’t been feeling good lately so your purchase will become an investment
		when he inevitably kicks the bucket.

		<p>

		Be sure to follow Lyle E Style on Twitter: @mrestyle so you can read great things like: <br>
		"I admire people who have careers that go nowhere fast versus mine that has gone nowhere so slowly."<br>

		"Often I wonder if my life would have been different if I waited a second before I took my first breath." <br>

		 "As we approach #mosquitoseason I worry yet again that I may unknowingly kill the most talented #mosquito who ever lived." <br>

		"I refuse to Facebook because I see it suck the life out of people." <br>

		 "I haven't experienced the sensation of #boredom for decades but I've had the sensation of ‘what the hell am I doing with my life’ many times."
		 <p><br>



		<center><img SRC="graphx/2017_03.jpg" title="Kris Kristofferson" width="458" height="611" VSPACE=5></center>

		<p>


		Lyle got a chance to meet up with one of his heroes Kris Kristofferson at a rare acoustic performance this past Spring of 2017. "It was an amazing opportunity
		to meet up with him and I’m very grateful for it. On top of that, I got to see his memorable performance right up front and center, it was unreal." said Style.
		<br><br>



		<center><img SRC="graphx/2017_04.jpg" title="Script" width="459" height="454" VSPACE=5></center>

		<p>


		Style has completed his script "Don’t Bend For Coppers: The Life and Deaths of Johnny Kitsalano" and is working on getting it in to the right hands. "I only wish
		I knew who the right hands were and how to get it into them" said Style explaining that the script is about guy raised in a politically incorrect time who loved
		three things: music, his girlfriend and miserable old men. "Wouldn’t it be great to end up just like the person you admired most?" he asked me. I told him that
		I didn’t know and he said something like "hopefully we will all find out someday when this dark comedic drama gets made."
		<p><br>

		<p>


		After 25 years working in the film industry, Style has finally made it to the big screen with a speaking role. "Most of the work I’ve done in Film and Television
		has been as a stand-in, the odd commercial, a blur in the background or a role that ended up on the cutting room floor. It’s nice to have a speaking role in <i>Tempus
		Tormentum</i> and I’m grateful for it."
		<br><br>

		<center><img SRC="graphx/2017_06.jpg" title="Mickey Gilley" width="458" height="349" VSPACE=5></center>

		<p>


		Style got to spend an afternoon with Mickey Gilley recently. "It’s always great to spend one on one time with a legend. I’d love to follow him around for a week with
		a tape recorder and listen to his stories. He’s seen some stuff in his day and has an unbelievable career. I’ve been blessed to hear some behind the scenes stories
		that few get to hear.  Some of the stuff he has experienced is unreal and would make a hell of a book if told raw. The thing is, he has the most positive image with
		his fans that I’ve ever seen, he’s a very grateful and gracious man but the stories I want to capture could make him look somewhat bitter which is the last thing he
		is. The fact remains that he never got the recognition he deserves yet he’s one of the coolest guys still standing, on tour and he sings better than ever. Maybe
		someday he’ll agree to a book about the darker side of the music business that he’s seen first hand. And Jennifer, please don’t put that photo of me and Mr. Gilley up,
		I look like a nut."<br><br>

		<center><img SRC="graphx/2017_07.jpg" title="Grand Canyon with boychildren" width="460" height="381" VSPACE=5></center>

		<p>

		Style was spotted at the Grand Canyon with his boychildren. While in Arizona, Style also met up with Robert Shields at his home. "Mr. Shields is an unreal talent. He was
		Entertainer Of The Year in Las Vegas for two years in a row back in the day. I wish he were still out there performing because the world is really missing out. He
		still has it! He really blows me away with his art, talent, stories and point of view. He has an amazing perspective on the entertainment business. I’d encourage anyone
		to get to know the works of Robert Shields."<br><br>

		He took some more pics of Alice recently so he said he’d allow us to put a few up. <br>
		<p><br><br>

		<p><br>


		Style has been doing his best to be a good parent and to learn from the mistakes his parents made raising him. "My parents would encourage me to live each day as if it were my
		last, and so I did. Unbeknownst to them, every morning I would look in the mirror and tell myself ‘I am going to die later today’ and I found myself persistently worrying about
		it. I was constantly adjusting my will and after decades of living each day as though it were my last, I realized it was actually making me quite depressed, very quick to
		startle and anxious. So, I decided to tell my kids to expect good things to come their way every day and to enjoy life as they choose."


		<p>

		<center><img SRC="graphx/2017_11.jpg" width="459" height="307" VSPACE=5></center>

		<p>

		Since the last update, a new Roy Orbison album has been released called "One Of The Lonely Ones", a lost album featuring six songs written/co-written by Lyle’s late
		friend/mentor. "I miss Bill Dees every day, he had a huge impact on my life. He must have sung me a few hundred songs over the years but I never heard him mention
		these tracks to me, so naturally I was blown away to see a lost album released. Even more so, the song ‘Little Girl (In The Big City)’, I believe, is the first song
		out of the sixty plus that Roy Orbison recorded that was all credited to Bill. It’s a great album, I hope there are more in the vaults! Roy Orbison’s estate is doing
		an awesome job keeping his memory alive. I really hope more estates like Roger Miller, Lee Hazlewood and Merle Haggard’s have similar surprises for the fans coming soon."

		<p><br>


		<center><img SRC="graphx/2017_12.jpg" title="Merle Haggard" width="459" height="466" VSPACE=5></center>


		<p>


		Style has recently come to terms with the death of his hero, the great Merle Haggard. "Mr. Haggard and I seemed to hit it off when I first met him, he even gave me his
		cell phone number, invited me to his home studio and told me to keep in touch. I called him up once and felt sort of bad, like I was bothering him. Then I called one
		more time and realized he was just being nice about the keeping in touch. Since that day I’ve always let the celebrity phone calls be incoming. Often, I ask my wife
		if she changed our phone number. I love Merle Haggard though, I’m so thankful I had the opportunity to spend time with him on multiple occasions, to interview him,
		see many of his phenomenal concerts and got to know his management and crew a little. We also lost his exceptionally cool sax player, Don Markham who was in The Strangers.
		It’s sad not being able to plan another trip around catching a Merle Haggard concert."
		<p>

		Style finished writing a children’s book called "Don’t You Dare Poke The Bear". He provided no details, albeit, we didn’t ask for any.

		<p>

		There’s been much speculation as to what happened to Lyle since there have been no website updates for a few years. Well, we can point the blame at the legal battle that he
		was in with Walmart. He specifically asked us not to post anything about this because apparently all publicity is good publicity and he doesn’t want to promote that company
		in any way. However, this situation has had a huge impact on his life and career so we thought we’d throw this in at the end of this News Update if anyone wants to hear
		some of the horror he’s gone through so they can learn from his experience.

		<p>

		Despite Walmart’s employee assaulting him in 2011 on their property and causing permanent damage to his lower back and sacrum by driving a train of shopping carts directly
		into him while he was in an isle, he had to "give up" the legal battle in order to save his house and years of his life that it would take to continue. "They played dirty
		from the start. Right after I was assaulted by their employee, I was told to expect I was under surveillance by Walmart’s people. I did absolutely nothing wrong, yet I’ve
		been looking over my back for over five years. To go through years more of this BS was ridiculous. Never mind the chronic pain, wondering if I’m being watched, especially
		when I’m with my kids is an awful way to go about your day. The entire experience was beyond an invasion of privacy and not at all conducive to healing."

		<p>

		He continued after a long awkward break, "It should have been over years ago and they even agreed to judicially assisted dispute resolution, however, after they got all my proof,
		I believe they knew they would have no choice but to pay up when it got in front of a judge. So these ____ ____  (unintelligible) strategically changed their mind and demanded
		this now go to trial because they likely knew it would cost me and my family everything and there would be no way we could afford to continue. It would cost us nearly 75k to
		continue for this to go to the trial that they demanded, and if they got off on a technicality, I would also have to pay another 100k or more for their legal fees."

		<p>

		Style told us "off the record" (which we think is a music reference?) during a phone interview (that had poor cell reception quality) that "They hire the ____ _____ (unintelligible)
		lawyers on the planet. These _____  _____ (unintelligible) had hundreds of documents of my personal files so they knew my financial status and they used this to their advantage.
		For every page they had, they started to demand what seemed like five more. Despite them having ten years of my medical history and me never having a lower back injury, they
		demanded all medical records since I was born. And, I believe they were trying to make me commit career suicide by demanding time consuming letters and documents from production
		companies and people I worked with that would do nothing but cost me future work with them. They also implied they would cause legal problems for the people in my life that
		helped me medically with my pain because they treated me outside their medical offices and didn’t charge me, which they implied, was a violation to their respective professional
		associations. So continuing would not only make us have to take out a second mortgage on our house, it would likely cause legal problems for people who were kind by trying to
		help me get better. I would hang my head in profound shame if I did what they did, it’s unbelievable how a major corporation could do something so wrong when they were clearly
		at fault and admitted so, which I have on tape. The only saving grace is the employee drove those carts into me instead of my three year old son who was with me that evening,
		because that impact would have likely killed him. ____ _____ (unintelligible) are _____ (unintelligible) corporate bullies that would rather spend money on their lawyers fighting
		against their innocent victims than using that money to do the right thing. Just because a person may not be super successful in their career doesn’t give Walmart the right to take
		it away from that person. I have their representatives on tape saying they would reimburse me for all my expenses, they lied. They also admitted they were liable as they had the
		assault on video, but then, it all of a sudden didn’t exist once it came to presenting it to my lawyer. And me recording the very same conversation that they were recording was
		apparently illegal of me, because I didn’t say that, I, too, was recording the conversation. This according to their _____ _____ (unintelligible) made their admitting guilt and
		them saying they would look after expenses inadmissible. Remember Jennifer, I know you’re new here, this is all off the record." [In an effort to be off the record, it should be
		 mentioned that not once did Style ever actually say the word "Walmart" in these interviews, instead of "wal", a variety of four letter words were used.]

		<p>

		Style continued, "I sold off ten grand of music gear to pay for doctors letters and medical treatment and it got me nowhere. Walmart dragged each step of this out for ____ (unintelligible)
		years to the point that we could not cover the expenses of legal representation for a trial that would take years to hit the courts. All this because I took my son for rubber boots
		to Walmart. I hope people learn from my mistake and make better informed decisions on where they shop. If you end up in the same boat I did, you may learn, like I did, that it
		appears that Canadian lawyers are afraid of Walmart so they will demand $375 an hour plus taxes like mine did when it came to going to trial. My lawyers were _____ _______ (unintelligible)
		and weren’t even able to get the money back that they, themselves, advised me to spend on the case. The Canadian judicial system is unlike anything I’ve ever seen, set up to help the
		perpetrator and all the lawyers, not the victim who gets victimized over and over by the process."

		<p>

		We had some staff leave due to financial reasons over the last few years and we would like to thank them for all their great work. We also welcome Jennifer Wesmax to the Electric
		Recordings team who is currently interning.

		<p>

		Style continues to be in ongoing medical treatment stating that "after hundreds of related medical appointments to the Walmart assault, I’m seeing some improvement by osteopathic
		therapy which gives me hope for the future."

		<p>

		Style is in pre-pre-production for his next album "Behind Of His Time". "I almost lost everything because of the Walmart fiasco so I am not recording the album yet. I have written
		a bunch of new songs for it but need an angel to descend from heaven to help get back in the studio." Release date is TBA. "Hopefully it’ll be in my lifetime" he added.

		<p>

		To end on a happy note, Style went to the Smithsonian to get up close to the roots of his raising and what helped make him the man he is today.

		<p>

		Thanks for your interest in the life and times of Mr. E Style, we hope good things come your way right now and always!
