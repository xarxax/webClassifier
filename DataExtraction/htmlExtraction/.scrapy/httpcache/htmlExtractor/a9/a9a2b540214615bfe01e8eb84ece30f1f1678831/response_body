<b>Jan 4th, 1998. Raddison Edwardian Hotel, Heathrow.</b><br> I am at the 'Shinnenkai' anime convention, and have spent an alarmingly large proportion of the last 72 hours awake, hungry, spending money and watching Japanese animation.
<p>My friends and I go to the final screening of the convention. It is an anime entitled 'Angel's Egg', which I have not heard of before. Watching it, I am enthralled. Beautiful surreal deChirico-esqe imagery, little dialogue, not much plot to speak of. Somehow the whole dreamlike experience is added to by the fact that I am drifting in and out of conciousness. I was later unsure if I dreamt some parts of the film.<p>
<center>*********</center><p><b>Saturday the somethingth, 1998. Newport indoor market.</b><br> I purchase a copy of a movie called 'In the Aftermath' for the sum of three pounds. Thanks to the extensive anime and 80's movie knowledge of my friend Keith, I know this to be cheap post-nuclear sci-fi intercut with none other than footage from Angel's Egg!

<p>Please <a href=mailto:tim@spiteyourface.com>email me</a> or <a href="http://www.arborwood.com/forums/angelseggforum/" target=resourcewindow>post in the new forum</a> if you have any other info/links on Angel's Egg or any other of Oshii's lesser known works. I'm currently looking for copies of any of his live-action films such as <i>Talking Head</i> and <i>Red Spectacles</i> (I already have <i>Avalon</i>). If you can get me any of them in any form (including online via streamload or other means) then please do get in touch and let me know what you'd like in return! Thanks, I'd really love to see these.

<p> I have finally managed to aquire a 'fansub'* copy of the film, and more recently bought the unsubtitled Japanese DVD (Thanks to all who emailed to assist me in my quest!) so there should be some new images and observations here soon. I've also aquired an untranslated copy of the Oshii-directed second (and final) episode of the abortive anime OAV series 'Twilight Q'. It looks great, but I've no idea what's happening! If anyone out there has a script they could <a href="mailto:tim@spiteyourface.com">email</a> me, or would even just give me the gist, that would be great. Anyway, some pictures of that might be on here soon, maybe I'll even start a whole 'obscure Oshii' site some day...
<p>Well. There you go. Make of all this what you will, pick up a copy of 'In the Aftermath' if it's cheap, but preferably try to see the original and be amazed.

<p><font size=2>*For those of you not in the know, a fansub is a version of an anime not commercially avaliable in your country/language, subtitled copied and distributed by fans, for fans, on a strictly non-profit basis. Fansubbing keeps western anime fandom alive, but unfortunately certain commercial anime distributors have recently cracked down on it, so all the UK fansubbers seem to be lying low :-( But there are many fansubbing operations worldwide, and many will send stuff overseas. In this day and age you can even download fansubs if you have broadband and/or lots of patience!!<br>THE place to go to find fansubs and fansubbers is <a href="http://www.fansubs.net">www.fansubs.net</a>, very handy!</font>
