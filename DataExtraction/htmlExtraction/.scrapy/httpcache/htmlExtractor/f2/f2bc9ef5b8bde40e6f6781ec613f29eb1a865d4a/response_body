<H1>Letterpress Printing as a Hobby</H1>
<P>[Originally posted to <A HREF="news:rec.crafts.misc">rec.crafts.misc</A>, but maintained periodically since.]</P>
<P>There is an active Letterpress underground or renaissance in England and to a lesser degree here in the US.
(Possibly more printers here, but spread over a greater landmass at lower density, so less <I>apparent</I> activity.)</P>
<P>I enjoy letterpress printing as a break from using computers. The pieces look like they do what they do; I can
get my hands on them. I mostly print stationary and greeting cards for my own family, but many hobby printers are
more book-arts artisans, doing literary or artistic keepsakes for circulation among their friends and fellow printers
or for-sale through literary/artistic outlets. With a small tabletop press and a limited range of type, one can
print in a studio apartment, but given the toxicity of lead-oxide, it is not advisable. A large dry basement is
preferable: dry to avoid both rust and the &quot;efflorescing&quot; rot of humidity pulling the tin from the lead-alloy
type (that's where those pits in the Colonial types are from: seaport presses with imported type).
<H2>Availability of <A NAME="equipment"></A>equipment</H2>
<P>Some letterpress presses are still in commercial operation for specialty operations: imprinting, stamping, die-cutting,
numbering, etc. The presses most desirable for these operations (e.g. the Heidelberg Windmill and Chandler &amp;
Price New-style platens) are hard to find for amateur use (unless in poor condition), although a sudden relocation
may make one temporarily available for salvage.</P>
<P>Believe it or not, spare parts are still available &quot;new&quot;. There are firms such as <B>N.A.Graphics</B>,
formerly of Cincinnati, ( PO Box 467, Silverton, CO 81433, Phone: 970-387-01212, FAX: 970-387-0127 Fritz Klinke
<nagraph@FRONTIER.NET> ), that have bought up failing dealers' inventories. N.A.Graphics bought the inventory from
Kelsey and the whole business including trademark from Vandercook, and stock parts for other presses too.</P>
<P><B>Letterpress Things</B>, Chicopee MA (John Barrett) is an east-coast supplier of used and &quot;new old stock&quot;
presses parts and supplies.<A HREF="http://www.letterpressthings.com/html/about.htm">http://www.letterpressthings.com/html/about.htm</A>

Presses and other tools of the trade are best found through the grapevine (and <I>The Printer</I>). Prices asked
vary widely, but can sometimes be found close to home. If the printer's widow's realtor has already sold the house,
they may pay you to haul it <I>all</I> out, if you take it all; but some people remember clearly what they paid
for it, and want to realize a profit in spite of any use they may have gained from it, whether demand will support
their asking price or not. Local availability here seems cyclic; we have alternate shortages of presses and shortages
of people to salvage free presses before the scrap metal man gets there. (As a museum official, I can not give
advise on prices, so please don't ask. Check <I>The Printer</I>'s classifieds)
<H3><A NAME="type"></A>Type</H3>
<P>There are many <B>sources of Type </B>still available.</P>
<P>There is also a lot of <B>ATF</B> type (American Type Founders, recently totally defunct) still out there as
shelf-ware new in original wrappers; N.A.Graphics (Fritz Klinke nagraph@FRONTIER.NET) has a lot of it, and there's
more scattered around. You find a few fonts in wraps at every closed press. Finding matching caps &amp; lowercase
&amp; figures in sufficient quantity and ranges to be useful is a problem, though; when someone finds a big enough
hoard to offer useful ranges, the price goes up!</P>
<P><B>Stephensen &amp; Blake</B>, heirs to <B>Wm.Caslon &amp; Sons</B>, still has the originals, and sometimes
will sell castings. They've run out of stock of a few sizes of true Caslon, and will not restock until they're
sufficiently backorders ... the curse of zero-based inventory management! but they exist. The Spanish branch of
Bauer still sells their excellent Bodoni, which an acquaintance recently picked up on vacation (expressly scheduled).</P>
<P>There are small boutique foundries doing luxury castings of both real foundry type and more commonly slightly
stiffened Monotype for handsetting; especially popular in the States are English Monotype matrices cast on American
Monotype casters. (<B>M&amp;H Type</B>, <B>Quaker City</B>, the <B>Dale Guild</B>, Harold Berliner, Out of Sorts
all spring to mind, although the latter is I fear out of business and rumor has H.B. serious back-ordered. And
most local areas have one or three small presses with Monotype machines who are willing to do comp jobs that can
be distributed after a short run; some even will cast fonts.) Just to confuse matters, the association and convention
of small foundries is also called ATF, <B>American Typecasters Fellowship</B>.</P>
<P>The big news in type is that what may be the <B>last new type face</B> in <B>commercial metal-type</B> has been
released: <B>Hermann Zapf </B>finally finished his long (30 years?) awaited Civilit&eacute;; Harold Berliner has
(exclusive?) firmin to cast it in America (on Monotype casters I fear) at only moderately exorbitant prices. (Caps,
LC, swashes &amp; alternates will add up to $250 plus shipping, if memory serves.) There is another new metal face
in production; Dan Carr of Golgonzoola Type Foundry in Ashuelot N.H. is doing his new face in both Mac-Type-1 and
Monotype, using hand-carved punches, but he's not in the business of selling metal type by the font, he sells it
by the composition job.
<H3>Rollers</H3>
<P>On the <B>roller</B> question: you can frequently buy cast rollers from traditional suppliers of letterpress,
and the #25 price sounds quite good. Here in the US, many companies which do Offset rollers can wind sheet rubber
onto any size of roller core, cure/vulcanize, and trim to fit on a lathe, which avoids finding an exactly matching
mold for casting but has higher labo[u]r charges. There are a few services left who will cast rollers of either
traditional &quot;composition&quot; (glue/sugar) or modern plastic on your cores (or sell you cores). Some people
follow the advice in old manuals and cast their own composition rollers, but I find wound rubber and cast nitrile
to work well enough to avoid that bother, and the bother of worrying about matching the weather. (You need different
mixes of glue/sugar in the roller to have the right stiffness in different temperatures and humidities: or else!)

<P>There are several Amateur Press Associations as well, to which several hundred amateur presses submit a like-sized
pile of their work to be redistributed in &quot;bundles&quot; to all members; they advertise for membership in
The Printer. One is on-line: <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/aapa96/">American Amateur Press Association</A> or

<H3>Museums</H3>
<P>There are significant printing <A NAME="museums"></A><B>museums</B> in Germany and California and a new one
in Texas; there are numerous smaller museums and exhibits within larger historical recreation villages or industrial
history museums: <A HREF="http://www.amrcorp.com/sabr_grp/interact/belgium.htm">Belgium</A>, Old Washington Historic
[Arkansas] State Park, Williamsburg VA, Sturbridge MA, Mystic CT., <A HREF="http://www.speakeasy.org/~eoeleven/">Washington
state</A>, Washington DC (<A HREF="http://www.si.edu/organiza/museums/nmah/homepage/docs/pgraf25.htm">Smithsonian</A>).
Eventually, we hope to have a major one here in Boston/Massachusetts/ New England. The Friends of the <A HREF="fomp.html">Museum
of Printing</A>, Inc. produces a newsletter and has many tons of <A HREF="invty.html">collected</A> presses, type,
etc. (400 Tons at last count, ranging from the classic Washington Handpress to a 35 Ton rotary web stereotype press
from a defunct newspaper, and antique foundry type to die for.) Patronage-level support muchly appreciated as well.
