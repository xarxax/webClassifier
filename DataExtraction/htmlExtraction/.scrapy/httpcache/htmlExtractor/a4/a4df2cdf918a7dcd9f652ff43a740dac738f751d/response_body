<td><b><font face="Rockwell">If you're familiar with the music of Steve
Haggard, then</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Rockwell">you already know that he's a truly original
artist. Steve's signature sound is best described as "Genuine American
Roots Music", and is a potent blend of Americana, rockin' country, some
down-home blues, a little bit of folk, and a dash of rockabilly. Steve
is a man of many talents: a fine, distinctive vocalist, a great songwriter,
and an excellent musician. (In addition to playing the guitar and mandolin,
he is a virtuoso blues harmonica player.) And in the past</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Rockwell">decade, he has become one of the top producers
around, winning acclaim for his work in the studio with artists and bands
not only from the USA, but from Canada, England, Norway, Sweden and Finland.&nbsp;</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Rockwell">Despite being on a small independent label
-- <i>Nashville's</i></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Rockwell"><i>Renegade Record Label</i>, Wild Oats Records,
of course !! -- Steve Haggard has built a (growing) legion of extremely
devoted fans around the world. He has done some 50 tours outside of the
USA and played in 17 countries, performing everywhere from Europe to the
Middle East. Steve's five</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Rockwell">CDs have picked up radio play in over 20 countries,
and</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Rockwell">been distributed on five continents. (Steve
will be on tour</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Rockwell">in Europe again in Summer 2009.)</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Rockwell">Steve's previous CD, <i>Mysterious Ways</i>,
has won glowing reviews from music journalists here and overseas, as well
as praise from a wide spectrum of music lovers... and now there's a brand-new
Steve Haggard CD, <i>Love Conquers All.</i>&nbsp;</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Rockwell">The early response has been great, and understandably
so.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Rockwell">Last, but not least, Steve is a dynamic and
inspiring stage performer, whether in a festival, concert or club setting;
whether he's playing a little roadhouse here in Tennessee, or to a crowd
of thousands at an outdoor festival in Europe,</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Rockwell">he and his band always deliver an evening
of great music&nbsp;</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Rockwell">Like many of the finest artists, Steve Haggard
has yet to receive the full recognition that he deserves... a situation
that is changing all the time, however, as more and more people hear his
music and become aware of his talents. If you haven't heard Steve yet,
we strongly urge you to do so!&nbsp;</font></b>
