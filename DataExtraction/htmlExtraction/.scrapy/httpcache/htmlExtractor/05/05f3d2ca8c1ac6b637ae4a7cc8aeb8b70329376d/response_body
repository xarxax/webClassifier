      our personal favorite series so we're more than happy to anything
      we can to encourage web authors building pages about Sazan Eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      <font size=+1>I</font>f you are a web author with a Sazan Eyes themed
      web page, we'd like to add you the the Sazan Eyes Ring of the Third Eye.

      <font size=+1>H</font>ere are the basic requirements to be added to
      the web ring:

  <tr valign=top>
    <td><em><font size=+2 color="#FF0000">#1</font></em></td>
    <td>
      <font size=+1>Y</font>our page should be <strong>about</strong>
      Sazan Eyes. That's why it's called the <strong>Sazan Eyes</strong> Ring of
      the Third Eye. This ring is <em>not</em> for personal web pages or for
      general interest or general anime pages. Just pages
      <strong>about</strong> Sazan Eyes.<br><br>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign=top>
    <td><em><font size=+2 color="#FF0000">#2</font></em></td>
    <td>
      <font size=+1>Y</font>our page should <em>exist</em> and be
      functional. Most good pages are constantly under construction but
      people should be able to visit your page and see something worth
      visiting.  If you are not yet ready for visitors, wait until you are
      before joining the ring.<br><br>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign=top>
    <td><em><font size=+2 color="#FF0000">#3</font></em></td>
    <td>
      <font size=+1>N</font>o really <em>adult</em> material on your main
      page. You never know who's going to come in along the ring so there
      should be no adult material on your main page. If you <em>do</em>
      have adult material, that's okay just as long as it is not your only
      content and it is not on your main, registered page.<br><br>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign=top>
    <td><em><font size=+2 color="#FF0000">#4</font></em></td>
    <td>
      <font size=+1>Y</font>our page must contain the proper webring
      HTML fragment. After all, it would hardly make sense to for people
      on the web ring to visit your page without allowing anyone to
      travel the web ring <em>from</em> your page. You will be shown the
      fragment when you register your page.<br><br>

    <p>
     <font size=+1>I</font>f your page meets these basic requirements,
     you can <a
     href="http://www.webring.org/cgi-bin/webring?addform&ring=sazaneyes">register
     your page with the Sazan Eyes Ring of the Third Eye</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you have completed this form, you will be sent an e-mail
      message confirming your registration. However, you will not be
      part of the web ring until your page has been reviewed by the
      ringmaster. Under normal circumstances, you will be added within
      48 hours, as long as you have met the basic requirements. When you
      register your page, you will be shown the necessary HTML fragment
      which must be added to your page before your page can be
      officially added to the webring . You will also receive a copy of
      this HTML code in your e-mail confirmation.
