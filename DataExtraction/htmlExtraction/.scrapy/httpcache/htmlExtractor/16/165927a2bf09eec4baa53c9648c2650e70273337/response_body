     Oh no 😱 the dreaded 404 Not Found </h1>

    <h2>What you were looking for (<tt>/en/online/E860000-001/</tt>)
        isn’t here</h1>
    <p>Here are some possible reasons for it to be missing from this server (www.ucc.ie):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>we just updated the site design, and a few pages may have been lost in transit: please <a href="mailto:webmaster@ucc.ie?Subject=Missing web page&Body=I think the resource at https://www.ucc.ie/en/online/E860000-001/ linked from  needs checking.">email us</a>
      <li>it may be at another URI (web address) in UCC, <a style="text-decoration:none;color:blue;" href="http://www.ucc.ie/en/"><u>try a search</u> 🔎</a></li>
    <li>it may have been moved by its site-owner:
        there is one other file
        on this server with the same filename (<tt>E860000-001</tt>)
</li>
    <li>the URI (web address) <tt>https://www.ucc.ie/en/online/E860000-001/</tt> 
        may have been misspelled or mistyped ✐</li>
    <li>the folder <tt>/en/online/E860000-001/</tt> does not exist either; 
        the closest one above it seems to be
        <a href="https://www.ucc.ie/en/online/"><tt>https://www.ucc.ie/en/online/</tt></a> so you will be redirected there in 30 seconds
    </ul>
    <p><a style="text-decoration:none;color:blue;" href="">⬅ <u>Go back the way you came</u></a>
  |  
<a style="text-decoration:none;color:blue;" href="https://www.ucc.ie/en/online/"><u>Go up ⬆ to the folder above</u></a>
  |  
<a style="text-decoration:none;color:blue;" href="https://www.ucc.ie/"><u>Go to the UCC homepage ➡</u></a>
</p>
    <p>If you feel that this is all wrong, and that
       <tt>https://www.ucc.ie/en/online/E860000-001/</tt>
       ought to be there, 
       please email the <a href="mailto:ucconline@ucc.ie?Subject=Missing web page&Body=I think the resource at https://www.ucc.ie/en/online/E860000-001/ linked from  needs checking.">site owner</a>.</p>

           In UCC, we don’t have 404 errors. We have Peter Flynn (2<sup>nd</sup> from left) errors. Our first webmaster was the first person to ever break a link on the web, when he moved the location of a webpage on UCC’s servers (9th website in the world), without telling Tim Berners-Lee. Suffice it to say, such a change resulted in the need to error handle such an occurance, and the 404 was born. Thanks to our own Peter Flynn. Peter retired in August 2018 but his impact on UCC, Ireland and ultimately the world won’t be forgotten!
