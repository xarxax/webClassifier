<CENTER><H2>EPILOGUE</H2></CENTER>
<P>Here the fourteenth Episode of the Book of Wonder endeth 
and here the relating of the Chronicles of Little Adventures at 
the Edge of the World.  I take farewell of my readers.  But it 
may be we shall even meet again, for it is still to be told how 
the gnomes robbed the fairies, and of the vengeance that the 
fairies took, and how even the gods themselves were troubled 
thereby in their sleep; and how the King of Ool insulted the 
troubadours, thinking himself safe among his scores of archers 
and hundreds of halberdiers, and how the troubadours stole to 
his towers by night, and under his battlements by the light of 
the moon made that king ridiculous for ever in song.  But for 
this I must first return to the Edge of the World.  Behold, the 
caravans start.<P>
