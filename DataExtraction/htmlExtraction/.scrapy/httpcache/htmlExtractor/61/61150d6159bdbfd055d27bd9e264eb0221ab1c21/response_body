To the best of my knowledge this has all El-Hazard links in English (plus a few in other languages) organized by category. All links are occasionally checked and new links are added when found.<BR><BR>

I'm still looking for people to review it and offer suggestions. To give credit where credit is due, Chris Davies story, The Eleventh Night, helped with the initial development of Hiashi. What was initially a motovating factor later became a key character aspect. (And still later a subplot.) Thanks. Just goes to show how you can take a concept and run with it. This story is turning out to be longer than expected. I didn't plan on it being this big, but it just kept coming and coming and I couldn't find a way to shorten it without feeling like I took something important from the story as a whole.<BR>
<B>Continuity note:</B> This uses OVA dubbed continunity of the first El-Hazard series.<BR>
<B>Summary:</B> Afura is possessed by the ghost of the last Priest of Rock who wishes to complete is scheme which was interupted long before the Great Holy War. His biggest obsticale is the fifth Earther, Hiashi, and his ability to use the Lamps of the Three Great Priestesses.<BR>

<SPAN class="BIG">The Return</SPAN><BR>
<B>Continuity note:</B> Begins about 9 months after Rock and Redemption or 1 year after Makoto et al first arrived in El-Hazard.<BR>
<B>Summary:</B> Galas's sabatoge did not destroy the Bugrom as thought. Instead it teleported them to whereever the Eye was last connected to, in other words Shininobi High. Now Makoto, Fujisawa, Nanami, Efurita, and the Priest and Priestess must return to Earth to save it from the Bugrom. Well, at least they have help from the science fiction club.<BR>
