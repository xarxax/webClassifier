<P>
<dt>A Robin Red breast in a Cage
<dt>Puts all Heaven in a Rage.
<dt>A dove house fill'd with doves & Pigeons
<dt>Shudders Hell thro' all its regions.
<dt>A dog starv'd at his Master's Gate
<dt>Predicts the ruin of the State.
<dt>A Horse misus'd upon the Road
<dt>Calls to Heaven for Human blood.
<dt>Each outcry of the hunted Hare
<dt>A fibre from the Brain does tear.
<dt>A Skylark wounded in the wing,
<dt>A Cherubim does cease to sing.
<dt>The Game Cock clipp'd and arm'd for fight
<dt>Does the Rising Sun affright.
<dt>Every Wolf's & Lion's howl
<dt>Raises from Hell a Human Soul.
<dt>The wild deer, wand'ring here & there,
<dt>Keeps the Human Soul from Care.
<dt>The Lamb misus'd breeds public strife
<dt>And yet forgives the Butcher's Knife.
<dt>The Bat that flits at close of Eve
<dt>Has left the Brain that won't believe.
<dt>The Owl that calls upon the Night
<dt>Speaks the Unbeliever's fright.
<dt>He who shall hurt the little Wren
<dt>Shall never be belov'd by Men.
<dt>He who the Ox to wrath has mov'd
<dt>Shall never be by Woman lov'd.
<dt>The wanton Boy that kills the Fly
<dt>Shall feel the Spider's enmity.
<dt>He who torments the Chafer's sprite
<dt>Weaves a Bower in endless Night.
<dt>The Catterpillar on the Leaf
<dt>Repeats to thee thy Mother's grief.
<dt>Kill not the Moth nor Butterfly,
<dt>For the Last Judgement draweth nigh.
<dt>He who shall train the Horse to War
<dt>Shall never pass the Polar Bar.
<dt>The Beggar's Dog & Widow's Cat,
<dt>Feed them & thou wilt grow fat.
<dt>The Gnat that sings his Summer's song
<dt>Poison gets from Slander's tongue.
<dt>The poison of the Snake & Newt
<dt>Is the sweat of Envy's Foot.
<dt>The poison of the Honey Bee
<dt>Is the Artist's Jealousy.
<dt>The Prince's Robes & Beggars' Rags
<dt>Are Toadstools on the Miser's Bags.
<dt>A truth that's told with bad intent
<dt>Beats all the Lies you can invent.
<dt>It is right it should be so;
<dt>Man was made for Joy & Woe;
<dt>And when this we rightly know
<dt>Thro' the World we safely go.
<dt>Joy & Woe are woven fine,
<dt>A Clothing for the Soul divine;
<dt>Under every grief & pine
<dt>Runs a joy with silken twine.
<dt>The Babe is more than swadling Bands;
<dt>Throughout all these Human Lands
<dt>Tools were made, & born were hands,
<dt>Every Farmer Understands.
<dt>Every Tear from Every Eye
<dt>Becomes a Babe in Eternity.
<dt>This is caught by Females bright
<dt>And return'd to its own delight.
<dt>The Bleat, the Bark, Bellow & Roar
<dt>Are Waves that Beat on Heaven's Shore.
<dt>The Babe that weeps the Rod beneath
<dt>Writes Revenge in realms of death.
<dt>The Beggar's Rags, fluttering in Air,
<dt>Does to Rags the Heavens tear.
<dt>The Soldier arm'd with Sword & Gun,
<dt>Palsied strikes the Summer's Sun.
<dt>The poor Man's Farthing is worth more
<dt>Than all the Gold on Afric's Shore.
<dt>One Mite wrung from the Labrer's hands
<dt>Shall buy & sell the Miser's lands:
<dt>Or, if protected from on high,
<dt>Does that whole Nation sell & buy.
<dt>He who mocks the Infant's Faith
<dt>Shall be mock'd in Age & Death.
<dt>He who shall teach the Child to Doubt
<dt>The rotting Grave shall ne'er get out.
<dt>He who respects the Infant's faith
<dt>Triumph's over Hell & Death.
<dt>The Child's Toys & the Old Man's Reasons
<dt>Are the Fruits of the Two seasons.
<dt>The Questioner, who sits so sly,
<dt>Shall never know how to Reply.
<dt>He who replies to words of Doubt
<dt>Doth put the Light of Knowledge out.
<dt>The Strongest Poison ever known
<dt>Came from Caesar's Laurel Crown.
<dt>Nought can deform the Human Race
<dt>Like the Armour's iron brace.
<dt>When Gold & Gems adorn the Plow
<dt>To peaceful Arts shall Envy Bow.
<dt>A Riddle or the Cricket's Cry
<dt>Is to Doubt a fit Reply.
<dt>The Emmet's Inch & Eagle's Mile
<dt>Make Lame Philosophy to smile.
<dt>He who Doubts from what he sees
<dt>Will ne'er believe, do what you Please.
<dt>If the Sun & Moon should doubt
<dt>They'd immediately Go out.
<dt>To be in a Passion you Good may do,
<dt>But no Good if a Passion is in you.
<dt>The Whore & Gambler, by the State
<dt>Licenc'd, build that Nation's Fate.
<dt>The Harlot's cry from Street to Street
<dt>Shall weave Old England's winding Sheet.
<dt>The Winner's Shout, the Loser's Curse,
<dt>Dance before dead England's Hearse.
<dt>Every Night & every Morn
<dt>Some to Misery are Born.
<dt>Every Morn & every Night
<dt>Some are Born to sweet Delight.
<dt>Some ar Born to sweet Delight,
<dt>Some are born to Endless Night.
<dt>We are led to Believe a Lie
<dt>When we see not Thro' the Eye
<dt>Which was Born in a Night to Perish in a Night
<dt>When the Soul Slept in Beams of Light.
<dt>God Appears & God is Light
<dt>To those poor Souls who dwell in the Night,
<dt>But does a Human Form Display
<dt>To those who Dwell in Realms of day.

<UL><DL><P>
<DT><font size="+2">T</font>HE bell struck one and shook the silent tower 
<DT>The graves give up their dead: fair Eleanor 
<DT>Walk'd by the castle-gate, and looked in: 
<DT>A hollow groan ran thro' the dreary vaults. 
<P>
<DT>She shriek'd aloud, and sunk upon the steps, 
<DT>On the cold stone her pale cheek. Sickly smells 
<DT>Of death, issue as from a sepulchre, 
<DT>And all is silent but the sighing vaults. 
<P>
<DT>Chill death withdraws his hand, and she revives; 
<DT>Amazed she finds herself upon her feet, 
<DT>And, like a ghost, thro' narrow passages 
<DT>Walking, feeling the cold walls with her hands. 
<P>
<DT>Fancy returns, and now she thinks of bones 
<DT>And grinning skulls, and corruptible death 
<DT>Wrapt in his shroud; and now fancies she hears 
<DT>Deep sighs, and sees pale sickly ghosts gliding. 
<P>
<DT>At length, no fancy, but reality 
<DT>Distracts her. A rushing sound, and the feet 
<DT>Of one that fled, approaches.--Ellen stood, 
<DT>Like a dumb statue, froze to stone with fear. 
<P>
<DT>The wretch approaches, crying, "The deed is done; 
<DT>"Take this, and send it by whom thou wilt send; 
<DT>"It is my life--send it to Eleanor-- 
<DT>"He's dead, and howling after me for blood! 
<P>
<DT>"Take this," he cried; and thrust into her arms 
<DT>A wet napkin, wrapt about; then rush'd 
<DT>Past, howling: she received into her arms 
<DT>Pale death, and follow'd on the wings of fear. 
<P>
<DT>They pass'd swift thro' the outer gate; the wretch, 
<DT>Howling, leap'd o'er the wall into the moat, 
<DT>Stifling in mud. Fair Ellen pass'd the bridge, 
<DT>And heard a gloomy voice cry, "Is it done ?" 
<P>
<DT>As the deer wounded Ellen flew over
<DT>The pathless plain as the arrows that fly
<DT>By night; destruction flies, and strikes in darkness.
<DT>She fled from fear, till at her house arrived.
<P>
<DT>Her maids await her on her bed she falls, 
<DT>That bed of joy where erst her lord hath press'd:
<DT>"Ah, woman's fear!" she cried, "Ah, cursed duke!
<DT>"Ah, my dear lord! ah, wretched Eleanor!
<P>
<DT>"My lord was like a flower upon the brows
<DT>"Of lusty May! Ah, life as frail as flower!
<DT>"O ghastly death! withdraw thy cruel hand,
<DT>"Seek'st thou that flower to deck thy horrid temples?
<P>
<DT>"My lord was like a star in highest heaven
<DT>"Drawn down to earth by spells and wickedness;
<DT>"My lord was like the opening eyes of day,
<DT>"When western winds creep softly o'er the flowers.
<P>
<DT>"But he is darken'd; like the summer's noon 
<DT>"Clouded; fall'n like the stately tree, cut down; 
<DT>"The breath of heaven dwelt among his leaves. 
<DT>"O Eleanor, weak woman, fill'd with woe!" 
<P>
<DT>Thus having spoke, she raised up her head, 
<DT>And saw the bloody napkin by her side, 
<DT>Which in her arms she brought; and now, tenfold 
<DT>More terrified, saw it unfold itself.
<P>
<DT>Her eyes were fix'd; the bloody cloth unfolds, 
<DT>Disclosing to her sight the murder'd head 
<DT>Of her dear lord, all ghastly pale, clotted 
<DT>With gory blood it groan'd, and thus it spake: 
<P>
<DT>"O Eleanor, behold thy husband's head 
<DT>"Who, sleeping on the stones of yonder tower, 
<DT>"Was 'reft of life by the accursed duke! 
<DT>"A hired villain turn'd my sleep to death! 
<P>
<DT>"O Eleanor, beware the cursed duke, 
<DT>"O give not him thy hand, now I am dead; 
<DT>"He seeks thy love who, coward, in the night, 
<DT>"Hired a villain to bereave my life." 
<P>
<DT>She sat with dead cold limbs, stiffen'd to stone 
<DT>She took the gory head up in her arms; 
<DT>She kiss'd the pale lips; she had no tears to shed ; 
<DT>She hugg'd it to her breast, and groan'd her last.

<DT><font size="+2">W</font>HEN early morn walks forth in sober gray, 
<DT>Then to my black-eyed maid I haste away, 
<DT>When evening sits beneath her dusky bower 
<DT>And gently sighs away the silent hour, 
<DT>The village bell alarms, away I go, 
<DT>And the vale darkens at my pensive woe. 
<P>
<DT>To that sweet village, where my black-eyed maid
<DT>Doth drop a tear beneath the silent shade,
<DT>I turn my eyes; and pensive as I go
<DT>Curse my black stars, and bless my pleasing woe.
<P>
<DT>Oft when the summer sleeps among the trees, 
<DT>Whispering faint murmurs to the scanty breeze, 
<DT>I walk the village round; if at her side 
<DT>A youth doth walk in stolen joy and pride, 
<DT>I curse my stars in bitter grief and woe, 
<DT>That made my love so high, and me so low. 
<P>
<DT>O should she e'er prove false, his limbs I'd tear, 
<DT>And throw all pity on the burning air; 
<DT>I'd curse bright fortune for my mixed lot, 
<DT>And then I'd die in peace, and be forgot.

<DD>

<DT>The languid strings do scarcely move,

<DT>Smiles on my head and mounts his flaming car; 
<DT>Round my young brows the laurel wreathes a shade 
<DT>And rising glories beam around my head.
<p>
<DT>My feet are wing'd while o'er the dewy lawn
<DT>I meet my maiden risen like the morn.
<DT>Oh bless those holy feet, like angels' feet;
<DT>Oh bless those limbs, beaming with heavenly light!
<p>
<DT>Like as an angel glittering in the sky 
<DT>In times of innocence and holy joy; 
<DT>The joyful shepherd stops his grateful song 
<DT>To hear the music of an angel's tongue. 
<p>
<DT>So when she speaks, the voice of Heaven I hear; 
<DT>So when we walk, nothing impure comes near; 
<DT>Each field seems Eden, and each calm retreat; 
<DT>Each village seems the haunt of holy feet. 
<p>
<DT>But that sweet village, where my black-eyed maid 
<DT>Closes her eyes in sleep beneath night's shade, 
<DT>Whene'er I enter, more than mortal fire 
<DT>Burns in my soul, and does my song inspire.
