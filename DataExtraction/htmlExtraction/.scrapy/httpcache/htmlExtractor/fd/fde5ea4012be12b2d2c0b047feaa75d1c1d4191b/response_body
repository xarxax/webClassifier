<p><tt><span lang="es">P</span>oet and
antiquary, is the best-known member of one of the leading families of Cornwall.
His father, <b>Thomas Carew of Antony House</b>, in the parish of East Ant<span lang="es">h</span>ony, married
<b>Elizabeth</b>, daughter of <b>Sir Richard Edgecumbe</b>,
and their eldest son, <b>Richard</b>, was born at Ant<span lang="es">h</span>ony House on 17 Jul 1555. When
only eleven years old he became a gentleman commoner of Christ Church, Oxford,
but his rooms were in Broadgate Hall, and he was probably one of the two persons
called <b>Carew</b> appearing in a list of the undergraduates resident in that hall
about 1570. Here, when a scholar of three years' standing, he was called upon,
as he modestly says, '<i>upon a wrong conceived opinion touching my sufficiency</i>', to
dispute '<i>extempore</i><span lang="es">'</span> (impar congressus Achilli) with the matchless
<u><b><a href="PhillipSidney(Sir).htm">Sir Phi<span lang="es">l</span>lip S<span lang="es">idney</span></a></b></u>, in presence of the
<u><b><a href="RobertDudley(1ELeicester).htm"><span lang="es">Robert Dudley, E</span>arl of 
L<span lang="es">eicester</span></a></b></u><span lang="es">;</span> <u> <b>
<a href="AmbroseDudley(3EWarwick).htm">
<span lang="es">Ambrose Dudley, Earl of </span>W<span lang="es">arwick</span></a></b></u>, and
<span lang="es">'</span><i>divers
other great personages</i>'. What the issue of the contest was <b>Carew</b> has omitted to
state, but
later historians have added that the dispute resulted in a drawn battle. The
family estates passed to him early in life, and in the verses on his ancestors
and his issue which he incorporated in his '<i>Survey of Cornwall</i>' (pp. 246-7, ed.
1811) it
is recorded that he was the fifth of his race to inherit the patrimony. In 1577
he married <b>Juliana</b>, the eldest daughter of <u><b>
<a href="JohnArundellofTrerice.htm">John A<span lang="es">rundell</span> of Trerice</a></b></u>, by his first
wife, <b>Catherine</b>, daughter of <b>John Coswarth</b>, and through his marriage he
inherited a
part of the C<span lang="es">oswarth</span> property. </tt>
<p><tt>In 1581 he was appointed a justice of the
peace, and in 1586 he was called upon to act as high sheriff of Cornwall. As he
was the owner of large estates near several Cornish boroughs, and his
connections embraced the principal gentry of the
county, he had little difficulty in obtaining a seat in parliament. In 1584 he
was returned for Saltash, and in 1597 he sat for St. Michael's. He was one of
the deputy-lieutenants of Cornwall, and he served under <u><b>
<a href="WalterRaleigh(Sir).htm">Sir Walter R<span lang="es">aleigh</span></a></b></u>, the
lord-lieutenant of the county, in the posts of treasurer of the lieutenancy and
colonel of the regiment, five hundred strong, which had for its charge the
protection of Cawsand Bay. Of the Society of Antiquaries first established by
<b><a href="MathewParker(ArchbishopCanterbury).htm">Archibishop P<span lang="es">arker</span></a></b>, <b>Carew</b> became an active member in 1589, and about the same
time began the task of compiling an historical survey of his native county.
Among the gentry of Cornwall he took the first place, and the antiquaries of
London
accepted him as their equal. <b>Spelman</b>, who
addressed to him an '<i>Epistle on Tithes</i>', and <b>Camden</b> were his intimate friends,
and in <b>Ben Jonson</b>'<span lang="es">s</span> '<i>Execration upon Vulcan</i><span lang="es">'</span> he is classed with
<b>C<span lang="es">otton</span></b> and <b>Selden</b>. </tt>
<p><tt>In 1594 there appeared a rendering of
'Examen de Ingenios. The examination of men's wits<span lang="es">'</span> by <b>John 
H<span lang="es">uarte</span></b>. Translated
out of the Spanish Tongue by <b>M. Camillo Camilli</b>. Englished out of his Italian by
<span lang="es">'</span><i>R. C[<span lang="es">arew</span>], Esquire</i>', which was reprinted in
1596, 1604, and 1616. <b>H<span lang="es">uarte</span></b>'<span lang="es">s</span> work is a dull treatise of little value, on the
corporeal and mental qualities of men and women. <b>C<span lang="es">arew</span></b>'<span lang="es">s</span> translation is
dedicated to <b>Sir Francis Godolphin</b>, who lent him <b>C<span lang="es">amilli</span></b>'<span lang="es">s</span> version, a loan
recorded in the
words, '<i>Good Sir, your booke returneth vnto you clad in a Cornish gabardine</i>'.</tt><p><tt>He died on 6 Nov 1620, '<i>as he was at his
private prayers in his study </i>(his daily practice) <i>at fower in the afternoon</i>', and was buried in Ant<span lang="es">h</span>ony Church. </tt>
