    <font SIZE="2"><p></font><font size="3" color="#C0C0C0"><strong>After close to 25 years of
    silence as a solo artist, June Carter Cash has returned to recording and the 70 year old
    singer couldn&#146;t be happier. It felt so good says Cash of her recent appearance at the
    Grand Ole Opry on TNN. They were so kind to me. How could they not be? Perhaps no one
    embodies the spirit of Nashville more than Carter Cash. She has the ultimate country
    pedigree: A well-known singer-songwriter in her own right, she is also a descendant of one
    of the nation&#146;s first country recording stars, the Carter family, and is married to
    legendary singer Johnny Cash. Her new album, Press On, touches on all aspects of here
    career not the least of which is her resume as a television personality. Such songs as
    &quot; I Used To Be Somebody and &quot;Gatsby&#146;s Restaurant&quot; make reference to
    her stint as and acting student in New York in the 50s. That led to roles on Gunsmoke and
    the Jim Bowie Series, comedy skits on such variety programs s the Jack Paar show, and
    years later, TV-movies and appearances on Little house On The Prairie and Dr. Quinn
    Medicine Woman. &quot;I was always an actor&quot; she says in the kitchen of her home near
    Nashville. Uncle A.P. was the one who encouraged me. We would play shows in the
    coal-mining district in West Virginia, and he would say &quot;we could use a little
    comedy&quot;. Uncle A.P. was A.P. Carter, the patriarch of the Carter Family. Aunt Sara
    Carter, A.P.'s wife, was the lead singer Carter mother, Maybelle Carter, played lead
    guitar and sang harmony. The trio was discovered in 1927 in the mountains of southwest
    Virginia. Its repertoire is the backbone of America&#146;s folk-song heritage. Linda
    Ronstadt&#146;s &quot;I never will marry&quot; Elvis Presley&#146;s Are You Lonesome
    Tonight&quot; and Roy Acuff&#146;s &quot;Wabash Cannon Ball&quot; are all originally
    Carter Family songs. Folk singer Woody Guthrie borrowed the melody for &quot;This Land Is
    Your Land&quot; from a Carter song ,&quot;When The Worlds On Fire&quot; &quot;You Are My
    Sunshine&quot; is also based on a Carter melody. The original trio broke up in 1943 and
    mom Maybelle formed a new group with June, older daughter Helen and younger daughter
    Anita. The act arrived at Nashville&#146;s Grand Ole Opry in 1950. At the time, Carter
    Cash was on the charts with a Top -10 Hit &quot;Baby It&#146;s Cold Outside&quot;
    &quot;the Opry was a magic place that was my home&quot; she recalls. &quot;I couldn&#146;t
    do any wrong there.&quot; A then-known Johnny Cash watched Carter Cash from the audience
    one night and vowed. &quot;I&#146;m going to marry that girl someday&quot;. But that
    wouldn&#146;t happen for almost 20 years. In 1952 Carter Cash married singer Carl Smith
    and three years later gave birth to a daughter, Carlene Carter, now also a popular country
    singer. When the marriage dissolved Carter Cash went on tour with Elvis Presley. &quot;I
    kind of ran away,&quot; she says. I was handled by Col. Tom Parker. Working with Elvis was
    something for me to hide behind. Elvis had a big crush on ( younger sister ) Anita, but
    then he got a crush on me. Elvis got a crush on whoever was handy. I decided I
    wouldn&#146;t touch him with a ten foot pole. Lord only knows where He&#146;d been. I
    think that was a big shock to his ego. During this time Carter Cash, who had another
    daughter, Rosie, in 1958 with then husband Rip Nix, made her way to New York for acting
    lessons. Among her classmates: Joel Grey, Julie Newmar, and Jack Lord. James Dean was on
    the scene, too, &quot;James Dean gave me a rose, and that&#146;s all I&#146;ve ever had to
    say about it&quot; she says coyly. &quot;Everybody was a little foolish in New York&quot;.
    She returned to Nashville and joined the Johnny Cash Road Show in 1961. They wed in 1968.
    She&#146;s not only a lady that I&#146;ve shared my life with&quot;, says her famous
    husband, she is the person responsible for me still being alive. She came along at a time
    in my life when I was going to self-destruct. She got him off amphetamines and encouraged
    his spiritual development. &quot;Tall Lover Man&quot; addresses their relationship on her
    new CD. She sings his hit &quot;Ring Of Fire&quot; which she wrote when she was falling in
    love with him. Jack Lord asked me to come to do Hawaii Five-O but by then I was just too
    busy being Mrs. Johnny Cash, I guess&quot; Carter Cash Says &quot; I worked with John, but
    I had enough sence to walk just a little ways behind him. I could have made more records,
    but I wanted to have a marriage&quot;. The past year and a half has been difficult for
    Carter Cash, who lost Helen in 1998 and Anita last July, Now she&#146;s helping her
    husband battle Shy-Drager syndrome, a degenerative neurological disease. Being as bonded
    as we are, I don&#146;t know what it will do to me., losing Anita right this quickly after
    Helen&quot;, she says softly. Now it&#146;s up to June Carter Cash to carry on with her
    family&#146;s distinguished legacy. &quot;I don&#146;t feel 70&quot; she says. &quot;It
    never dawned on me until I saw it in the paper the other day. I said &quot;Oh lord, how
    did that happen?&quot; </strong></font></p>

    <font SIZE="2"><p><strong><font color="#C0C0C0">There&#146;s this strange combination of
    traditional log-cabin ceiling and elaborate chandelier in June&#146;s living room. She
    told me she had two warehouses full of antiques, that she is a passionate collector who
    buys only what she likes. The room was full of ethereal figurines, and she was cheerful,
    courteous, welcoming and willing to help in any way &#150; she even showed us clothes to
    select from. Johnny hung around in shorts and a casual shirt and watched; he made her feel
    comfortable. I had her hold the pearls because I think hands are important. My father told
    me that hands and mouths are the hardest things for artist to do well, and now I always
    consider the hands </font></strong></p>
