        <p>We are the birds always charmed by you from the top of
        these belvederes <br>
        And that each night form a blossoming branch between your
        shoulders and the arms of your well beloved wheelbarrow <br>
        Which we tear out swifter than sparks at your wrist <br>
        We are the sighs of the glass statue that raises itself
        on its elbow when man sleeps<br>
        And shining holes appear in his bed<br>
        Holes through which stags with coral antlers can be seen<b>
        </b>in a glade <br>
        And naked women at the bottom of a mine <br>
        You remembered then you got up you got out of the train <br>
        Without glancing at the locomotive attacked by immense
        barometric roots<br>
        Complaining about its murdered boilers in the virgin
        forest <br>
        Its funnels smoking jacinths and moulting blue snakes <br>
        Then we went on, plants subject to metamorphosis <br>
        Each night making signs that man may understand <br>
        While his house collapses and he stands amazed before the
        singular packing-cases<br>
        Sought after by his bed with the corridor and the
        staircase <br>
        The staircase goes on without end<br>
        It leads to a millstone door it enlarges suddenly in a
        public square <br>
        It is made of the backs of swans with a spreading wing
        for banisters <br>
        It turns inside out as though it were going to bite
        itself <br>
        But no, it is content at the sound of our feet to open
        all its steps like drawers <br>
        Drawers of bread drawers of wine drawers of soap drawers
        of ice drawers of stairs<br>
        Drawers of flesh with handsfull of hair <br>
        Without turning round you seized the trowel with which
        breasts are made<br>
        We smiled at you you held us round the waist<br>
        And we took the positions of your pleasure<br>
        Motionless under our lids for ever as woman delights to
        see man<br>
        After having made love.</p>

        <p>I attach no importance to life<br>
        I pin not the least of life's butterflies to importance<br>
        I do not matter to life<br>
        But the branches of salt the white branches<br>
        All the shadow bubbles<br>
        And the sea-anemones<br>
        Come down and breathe within my thoughts<br>
        They come from tears that are not mine<br>
        From steps I do not take that are steps twice<br>
        And of which the sand remembers the flood-tide<br>
        The bars are in the cage<br>
        And the birds come down from far above to sing before
        these bars<br>
        A subterranean passage unites all perfumes<br>
        A woman pledged herself there one day<br>
        This woman became so bright that I could no longer see
        her<br>
        With these eyes which have seen my own self burning<br>
        I was then already as old as I am now<br>
        And I watched over myself and my thoughts like a night
        watchman in an immense factory Keeping watch alone<br>
        The circus always enchants the same tramlines <br>
        The plaster figures have lost nothing of their expression
        <br>
        They who bit the smile's fig<br>
        I know of a drapery in a forgotten town<br>
        If it pleased me to appear to you wrapped in this drapery<br>
        You would think that your end was approaching<br>
        Like mine<br>
        At last the fountains would understand that you must not
        say Fountain<br>
        The wolves are clothed in mirrors of snow <br>
        I have a boat detached from all climates <br>
        I am dragged along by an ice-pack with teeth of flame <br>
        I cut and cleave the wood of this tree that will always
        be green <br>
        A musician is caught up in the strings of his instrument <br>
        The skull and crossbones of the time of any childhood
        story <br>
        Goes on board a ship that is as yet its own ghost only <br>
        Perhaps there is a hilt to this sword <br>
        But already there is a duel in this hilt <br>
        During the duel the combatants are unarmed <br>
        Death is the least offence <br>
        The future never comes</p>
        <p>The curtains that have never been raised<br>
        Float to the windows of houses that are to be built<br>
        The beds made of lilies<br>
        Slide beneath the lamps of dew<br>
        There will come an evening<br>
        The nuggets of light become still underneath the blue
        moss<br>
        The hands that tie and untie the knots of love and of air<br>
        Keep all their transparency for those who have eyes to
        see<br>
        They see the palms of hands<br>
        The crowns in eyes<br>
        But the brazier of crown and palms<br>
        Can scarcely be lit in the deepest part of the forest<br>
        There where the stags bend their heads to examine the
        years<br>
        Nothing more than a feeble beating is heard<br>
        From which sound a thousand louder or softer sounds
        proceed<br>
        And the beating goes on and on<br>
        There are dresses that vibrate<br>
        And their vibration is in unison with the beating<br>
        When I wish to see the faces of those that wear them<br>
        A great fog rises from the ground<br>
        At the bottom of the steeples behind the most elegant
        reservoirs of life and of wealth<br>
        In the gorges which hide themselves between two mountains
        <br>
        On the sea at the hour when the sun cools down <br>
        Those who make signs to me are separated by stars <br>
        And yet the carriage overturned at full speed <br>
        Carries as far as my last hesitation <br>
        That awaits me down there in the town where the statues
        of bronze<br>
        and of stone have changed places with statues of wax
        Banyans banyans.</p>

        The fish's tail crossing a beating heart <br>
        the throat regularly rising and falling to imitate the
        sea surrounding it<br>
        and the fish revolving about a ventilator<br>
        There are also hands<br>
        long white hands with nails of fresh greenery<br>
        and finger-joints of dew<br>
        swaying eyelashes looking at butterflies<br>
        saddened because the day made a mistake on the stairs<br>
        There are also sexes fresh as running water<br>
        which leap up and down in the valley<br>
        because they are touched by the sun<br>
        They have no beards but they have clear eyes<br>
        and they chase dragonflies<br>
        without caring what people will say</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hasten on your childhood to
        the hour when white in memory blue borders white in its
        eyes very white and piece of indigo of silver the glances
        white cross cobalt the white paper that blue ink tears
        bluish away ultramarine descends that white may rest
        troubled blue in dark green wall green that writes its
        pleasure rain green clear that swims green yellow in the
        clear oblivion at the edge of its green foot the sand
        earth song sand of the earth afternoon sand earth in the
        comer a violet jug the bells the folds of paper a metal
        sheep life stretching out the paper a rifle shot the
        paper rings the canaries in the shade white almost pink a
        river in the -white space in the clear blue shade<b> </b>of
        colours lilac a hand at the edge of the shade makes of
        the shade in the hand a very rose-coloured grasshopper a
        root lifts its head a nail the block of the trees with
        nothing else a fish a nest the heat in full light looks
        at a sunshade light the fingers in the light the white of
        the paper the sun light<b> </b>in the white cuts out a
        sparkling eyeshade the sun's light the very white sun the
        intensely white sun</p>

        <p>in secret<br>
        be quiet say nothing<br>
        except the street be full of stars<br>
        and the prisoners eat doves<br>
        and the doves eat cheese<br>
        and the cheese eats words<br>
        and the words eat bridges<br>
        and the bridges eat looks<br>
        and the looks eat cups full of kisses in the <i>orchata</i><br>
        that hides all with its wings<br>
        the butterfly the night<br>
        in a cafe last summer<br>
        in Barcelona</p>

        <p>I have a little windmill on my head<br>
        Which draws up water to my mouth and eyes<br>
        When I am hungry or moved to tears<br>
        I have a little horn full of the odour of absinth in my
        ears<br>
        And on my nose a green parakeet that flaps its wings<br>
        And cries 'Aux Armes'<br>
        When from the sky fall the seeds of the sun<br>
        The absence from the heart of steel<br>
        At the bottom of the boneless and stagnant realities<br>
        Is partial to crazy sea-fish<br>
        I am the captain and the alsatian at the cinema<br>
        I have in my belly a little agricultural machine<br>
        That reaps and binds electric flex<br>
        The cocoanuts thrown by the melancholy monkey<br>
        Fall like spittle into the water<br>
        Where they blossom again as petunias<br>
        I have in my stomach an ocarina and I have virginal faith<br>
        I feed my poet on the feet of a pianist<br>
        Whose teeth are even and uneven<br>
        And sad Sunday evenings<br>
        I throw my morganatic dreams<br>
        To the loving turtle-doves who laugh like hell.</p>

        <p>Morning trickles over the bruised vegetables<br>
        like a drop of sweat over the lines of my hand<br>
        I crawl over the ground<br>
        with stem and wrinkled mouth<br>
        the sun swells into the canals of monstrous leaves<br>
        which recover cemeteries harbours houses<br>
        with the same sticky green zeal<br>
        then with disturbing intensity there passes through my
        mind<br>
        the absurdity of human groupings<br>
        in these lines of closely packed houses<br>
        like the pores of the skin<br>
        in the poignant void of terrestrial space<br>
        I hear the crying of birds of whom it used to be said<br>
        that they sang and implacable resembled stones<br>
        I see flocks of houses munching the pith of the air<br>
        factories which sing as birds once sang<br>
        roads which lose themselves in harvests of salt<br>
        pieces of sky which become dry on verdigris moss<br>
        a pulley's creaking tells us that a bucket rises in a
        well<br>
        it is full of limpid blood<br>
        which evaporates in the sun<br>
        nothing else will trouble this circuit on the ground<br>
        until evening<br>
        which trembles under the form of an immense pinned
        butterfly<br>
        at the entrance of a motionless station.</p>
