Two poems by Friedrich H&ouml;lderlin
	</h1>

	<h2>
Translated by Maxine Chernoff and Paul Hoover
	</h2>
	
<p>
<span class="bold">The Ister (<i>Der Ister</i>)</span><br />
<br />
Now is the time for fire!<br />
Impatient for the daylight,<br />
We&#8217;re on our knees,<br />
Exhausted with waiting.<br />
It&#8217;s then, in that silence,<br />
We hear the woods&#8217; strange call.<br />
Meanwhile, we sing from the Indus,<br />
Which comes from far away, and<br />
From the Alpheus, since we&#8217;ve<br />
Long desired decorum.<br />
It&#8217;s not without dramatic flourish<br />
That one grasps<br />
Straight ahead<br />
What is closest<br />
To reach the other side.<br />
But here we want to build.<br />
Rivers make the land fertile<br />
And allow the foliage to grow.<br />
And if in the summer<br />
Animals gather at a watering place<br />
People will go there, too.<br />
<br />
This river is called the Ister.<br />
It lives in beauty. Columns of leaves burn<br />
And stir. They stand in the forest<br />
Supporting each other; above,<br />
A second dimension juts out<br />
From a dome of stones. So I&#8217;m<br />
Not surprised that the distantly gleaming river<br />
Made Hercules its guest,<br />
When in search of shadows<br />
He came down from Olympus<br />
And up from the heat of Isthmus.<br />
<br />
<br />
They were full of courage there,<br />
Which always comes in handy, like cool water<br />
And a path for the spirit to follow.<br />
That&#8217;s why the hero preferred<br />
To come to the water&#8217;s source, its fragrant yellow banks<br />
Black with fir trees, in whose depths<br />
The hunter likes to roam<br />
At noon and the resinous trees<br />
Moan as they grow.<br />
<br />
Yet the river almost seems<br />
To flow backwards, and I<br />
Think it must come<br />
From the East.<br />
Much could<br />
Be said further. But why does<br />
It hang so straight from the mountain? That other river,<br />
The Rhine, has gone away<br />
Sideways. Not for nothing rivers<br />
Flow in dryness. But how? We need a sign,<br />
Nothing more, something plain and simple,<br />
To remind us of sun and moon, so inseparable,<br />
Which go away &#8212; day and night also &#8212;<br />
And warm each other in heaven.<br />
They give joy to the highest god. For how<br />
Can he descend to them? And like earth&#8217;s ancient greenness<br />
They are the children of heaven. But he seems<br />
Too indulgent to me, not freer,<br />
And almost scornful. For when<br />
<br />
Day begins in youth,<br />
Where it commences growing,<br />
Another is already there<br />
To further enhance the beauty, and chafes<br />
At the bit like foals. And if he is happy<br />
Distant breezes hear the commotion;<br />
But the rock needs engraving<br />
And the earth needs its furrows;<br />
If not, an endless desolation;<br />
But what a river will do,<br />
Nobody knows.	<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<span class="bold">The Titans <i>(Die Titanen)</i></span>
<br />
<br />
It&#8217;s not yet<br />
Time. They are still<br />
Unbound. And the indifferent don&#8217;t care<br />
About godly matters.<br />
Let them puzzle it out<br />
With the Oracle. Meanwhile, during the festivities,<br />
I&#8217;ll take my ease thinking of the dead.<br />
In the old days, many generals died<br />
and lovely women and poets.<br />
Today, it&#8217;s many men.<br />
But I am alone.<br />
<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
and sailing on the ocean<br />
The sweetly scented islands<br />
Ask where they are.<br />
<br />
For something of them remains<br />
In writing and in myth.<br />
God reveals so much.<br />
For a long time the clouds<br />
Have influenced what&#8217;s below<br />
And the holy forest, fertile as a god,<br />
Has sent down roots.<br />
The world&#8217;s riches burn too intensely.<br />
For we don&#8217;t have the song<br />
That will shake our spirit free.<br />
It would consume itself,<br />
For the heavenly fire can never<br />
Endure captivity.<br />
<br />
Yet men enjoy<br />
The banquet, and in celebration,<br />
Their eyes are brightened by pearls<br />
On a young woman&#8217;s neck.<br />
Also games of war<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
and through<br />
The garden paths<br />
The memory of battle clatters;<br />
The resonant weapons<br />
Of heroic ancestors lie soothed<br />
And still upon the breasts<br />
Of children. But the bees hum<br />
Around me, and where the plowman<br />
Makes his furrows, birds<br />
Sing against the light. Many give<br />
Help to heaven. The poet<br />
Sees them. It&#8217;s good to rely<br />
On others. For no one can bear his life alone.<br />
<br />
For when the busy day<br />
Catches fire,<br />
And heavenly dew glistens<br />
On the chain<br />
Leading lightning from sunrise<br />
To its source, even mortals<br />
Feel its grandeur.<br />
That&#8217;s why they build houses<br />
And the workshop is so busy<br />
And ships sail against the currents<br />
And men exchange greetings<br />
Holding out their hands; it&#8217;s sensible<br />
On earth, and not for nothing<br />
Do we fix our eyes on the ground.<br />
<br />
Yet you sense<br />
A different way.<br />
For proportion demands<br />
That coarseness exist<br />
For purity to be known.<br />
<br />
But when the first cause<br />
Reaches into the earth<br />
To make it come to life,<br />
People think the heavenly<br />
Have come down to the dead<br />
And the all-knowing has dawned<br />
In a boundless emptiness.<br />
It&#8217;s not for me to say<br />
That the gods are growing weak<br />
Just as they come into being.<br />
But when<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
and it goes<br />
<br />
As far as the part in father&#8217;s hair, so that<br />
<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160;
and the bird of heaven<br />
Makes it known to him. Wonderful<br />
in anger, that&#8217;s what matters.<br />
<br />
<br />
