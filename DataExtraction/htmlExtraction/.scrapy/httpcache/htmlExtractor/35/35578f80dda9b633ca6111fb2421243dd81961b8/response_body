<DD><H4>I. PEACE</H4><P>
<DT>Now, God be thanked Who has matched us with His hour,
<DD>   And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping,
<DT>With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power,
<DD>   To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping,
	<UL>	<DT>Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary,
		<DD>Leave the sick hearts that honour could not move,
		<DT>And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary,
		<DD>And all the little emptiness of love!</UL>
<P>
<DT>Oh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there,
<DD>   Where there's no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending,
<DT>Naught broken save this body, lost but breath;
<DD>   Nothing to shake the laughing heart's long peace there
<DT>But only agony, and that has ending;
<DD>   And the worst friend and enemy is but Death.
</DL>

<DL>
<DD><H4>II. SAFETY</H4><P>
<DT>Dear! of all happy in the hour, most blest
<DD>   He who has found our hid security,
<DT>Assured in the dark tides of the world that rest,
<DD>   And heard our word, "Who is so safe as we?"
	<UL>	<DT>We have found safety with all things undying,
		<DD>The winds, and morning, tears of men and mirth,
		<DT>The deep night, and birds singing, and clouds flying,
		<DD>And sleep, and freedom, and the autumnal earth.</UL>
<P>
<DT>We have built a house that is not for Time's throwing.
<DD>   We have gained a peace unshaken by pain for ever.
<DT>War knows no power. Safe shall be my going,
<DD>   Secretly armed against all death's endeavour;
<DT>      Safe though all safety's lost; safe where men fall;
<DD>   And if these poor limbs die, safest of all.
</DL>

<DL>
<DD><H4>III. THE DEAD</H4><P>
<DT>Blow out, you bugles, over the rich Dead!
<DD>   There's none of these so lonely and poor of old,
<DT>But, dying, has made us rarer gifts than gold.
<DD>   These laid the world away; poured out the red
	<UL>	<DT>Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be
		<DD>Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene,
		<DT>That men call age; and those who would have been,
		<DD>Their sons, they gave, their immortality.</UL>
<P>
<DT>Blow, bugles, blow! They brought us, for our dearth,
<DD>   Holiness, lacked so long, and Love, and Pain,
<DT>Honour has come back, as a king, to earth,
<DD>   And paid his subjects with a royal wage;
<DT>      And Nobleness walks in our ways again;
<DD>   And we have come into our heritage.
</DL>

<DL>
<DD><H4>IV. THE DEAD</H4><P>
<DT>These hearts were woven of human joys and cares,
<DD>   Washed marvellously with sorrow, swift to mirth.
<DT>The years had given them kindness. Dawn was theirs,
<DD>   And sunset, and the colours of the earth.
	<UL>	<DT>These had seen movement, and heard music; known
		<DD> Slumber and waking; loved; gone proudly friended;
		<DT>Felt the quick stir of wonder; sat alone;
		<DD>Touched flowers and furs and cheeks. All this is ended.</UL>
<P>
<DT>There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter
<DD>   And lit by the rich skies, all day. And after,
<DT>Frost, with a gesture, stays the waves that dance
<DD>   And wandering loveliness. He leaves a white
<DT>      Unbroken glory, a gathered radiance,
<DD>   A width, a shining peace, under the night.
</DL>

<DL>
<DD><H4> V. THE SOLDIER</H4><P>
<DT>If I should die, think only this of me:
<DD>   That there's some corner of a foreign field
<DT>That is for ever England. There shall be
<DD>   In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;
	<UL>	<DT>A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,
		<DD>Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,
		<DT>A body of England's, breathing English air,
		<DD>Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.</UL>
<P>
<DT>And think, this heart, all evil shed away,
<DD>   A pulse in the eternal mind, no less
<DT>      Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;
<DD>Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;
<DT>   And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,
<DD>      In hearts at peace, under an English heaven.

<UL><DL><p>
<Dt>Your hands, my dear, adorable,
<DD> Your lips of tenderness
<Dt>--Oh, I've loved you faithfully and well,
<DD> Three years, or a bit less.
<DD> It wasn't a success.
<P>
<Dt>Thank God, that's done! and I'll take the road,
<DD> Quit of my youth and you,
<Dt>The Roman road to Wendover
<DD> By Tring and Lilley Hoo,
<DD> As a free man may do.
<P>
<dt>For youth goes over, the joys that fly,
<DD> The tears that follow fast;
<Dt>And the dirtiest things we do must lie
<DD> Forgotten at the last;
<DD> Even love goes past.
<P>
<Dt>What's left behind I shall not find,
<DD> The splendor and the pain;
<Dt>The splash of sun, the shouting wind,
<DD> And the brave sting of rain,
<DD> I may not meet again.
<P>
<Dt>But the years, that take the best away,
<DD> Give something in the end;
<Dt>And a better friend than love have they,
<DD> For none to mar or mend,
<DD> That have themselves to friend.
<P>
<Dt>I shall desire and I shall find
<DD> The best of my desires;
<Dt>The autumn road, the mellow wind
<DD> That soothes the darkening shires.
<DD> And laughter, and inn-fires.
<P>
<Dt>White mist about the black hedgerows,
<DD> The slumbering Midland plain,
<Dt>The silence where the clover grows,
<DD> And the dead leaves in the lane,
<DD> Certainly, these remain.
<P>
<Dt>And I shall find some girl perhaps,
<DD> And a better one than you,
<Dt>With eyes as wise, but kindlier,
<DD> With lips as soft, but true.
<DD> And I daresay she will do.

<UL><DL><p>
<dt>In your arms was still delight,
<dt>Quiet as a street at night;
<dt>And thoughts of you, I do remember,
<dt>Were green leaves in a darkened chamber,
<dt>Were dark clouds in a moonless sky.
<dt>Love, in you, went passing by,
<dt>Penetrative, remote, and rare,
<dt>Like a bird in the wide air;
<dt>And, as the bird, it left no trace
<dt>In the heaven of your face.
<dt>In your stupidity I found
<dt>The sweet hush after a sweet sound.
<dt>All about you was the light
<dt>That dims the graying end of night;
<dt>Desire was the unrisen sun,
<dt>Joy the day not yet begun,
<dt>With tree whispering to tree,
<dt>Without wind, quietly.
<dt>Wisdom slept within your hair,
<dt>And Long-suffering was there,
<dt>And, in the flowing of your dress,
<dt>Undiscerning Tenderness.
<dt>And when you thought, it seemed to me,
<dt>Infinitely, and like a sea,
<dt>About the sleight world you had known
<dt>Your vast unconsciousness was thrown. . . .
<p>
<dt>O haven without wave or tide!
<dt>Silence, in which all songs have died!
<dt>Holy book, where all hearts are still!
<dt>And home at length, under the hill!
<dt>O mother quiet, breasts of peace,
<dt>Where love itself would faint and cease!
<dt>O infinite deep I never knew,
<dt>I would come back, come back to you;
<dt>Find you, as a pool unstirred,
<dt>Kneel down by you, and never a word;
<dt>Lay my head, and nothing said,
<dt>In your hands, ungarlanded.
<dt>And a long watch you would keep;
<dt>And I should sleep, and I should sleep!
