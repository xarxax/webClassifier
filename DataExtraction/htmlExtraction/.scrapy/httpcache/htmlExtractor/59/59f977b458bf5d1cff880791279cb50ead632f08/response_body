        <p>Birch-white leg,<br>
        Love landscape,<br>
        Hips,<br>
        Her flower balcony,<br>
        Tender and gone to seed,<br>
        Full fragrance of narcissus,<br>
        You, man<br>
        I love!</p>
        <p align="right"><em>Frühling (1919)</em></p>

        <p><font color="#DA032E" size="6"><strong>Hands</strong></font></p>
        <p>Like rare animals they move up and down<br>
        And lie deep at the bottom of the sea;<br>
        Moon-colored is the stone, like a wound<br>
        Set in flowering plumage.</p>
        <p>I fear this hidden motion,<br>
        Like wind held up in branches;<br>
        So few fingers, in figures,<br>
        Will excite thoughts in me.</p>
        <p>The sea divides so that I can reach it -<br>
        In swaying underbrush of crystal night -<br>
        This hand, extended flat yet softly sunk,<br>
        There before my pallid face.</p>
        <p>I don't know whether the little bones, <br>
        Rinsed by the sea, will drift and mingle,<br>
        Or if, wrapped in clouds,<br>
        They will reach up for music and dance.</p>
        <p>I know that dreams without fragrance,<br>
        Like dead fingers rigid in the joints,<br>
        Do not give shrouded magic<br>
        For which the living call in sleep.</p>

        <p><font color="#DA032E" size="6"><strong>White and red</strong></font></p>
        <p>Clouds tumble from the skies,<br>
        Impenetrable hedges of white roses grow,<br>
        The heart, of marble, lies slain.<br>
        Snow stars float<br>
        In whitewashed time space.</p>
        <p>A human being, resurrected, screams,<br>
        Blood sprays from the fountains of the heart,<br>
        Roses burn in arms,<br>
        Dusk shed by a lamp brightens the tears.</p>

        fear</strong></font></p>
        <p>Evil pond surrounded by full lips<br>
        Angry ruby glass bursting off the bottom.<br>
        Secret tiger paths, sandy,<br>
        Drawn around golden almond flowers,<br>
        Labyrinth passages.<br>
        And hot rain pouring down<br>
        Among a spark dance of bodies.<br>
        Mangling through and through,<br>
        Sound from the top of the tower of need.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not received your
        address; I think you may not know it yourself since I
        just now walked down the big railroad station hall and
        sat down in a waiting room, afraid to go home. The other
        women left behind pushed on like sacks. The entire
        railroad station is a sound I am forced to hear, without
        interruption, as if all of us were united here. Wasteland
        of the world. Deftness turned to ungainliness. How the
        trains used to fly towards distant places with burning
        hearts. I am petrified, my own skin has become too taut
        over my flesh. I cannot shed a tear. The children will
        bombard me with questions because they think I went to
        visit you in the barracks. How unbearable separation into
        uncertainty is.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence all around, I am
        awake, my senses are alert as a dog's.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All thoughts you gave me
        light up around me; I am an animal with a halo. I switch
        off the bright lamp and send you a gentle night.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is tied to his
        golden hair. His ear is her little pond. Adelaide, with
        the feet of a princess, parts the dark-green water. Then
        she rests on a meadow, which is his hand. The grass is
        tall, light and young. She kisses all its leaves, one
        remains between her lips and in dream.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black and starless, they
        call in turn like animals in the forest. Softly enclosed
        in her arm, they rest together in the moss of lips, all
        heart. And the eyes, taken from earth at dusk, are
        radiant stones.</p>
        <p align="right"><em>Johannes (1921)</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font color="#DA032E" size="6"><strong>Wounded</strong></font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I became very sick. My
        heart is out of step. My body lies in bed weakly. Oh
        comrades, please come and take apart those bones which
        are of no more use in this flesh God has left. Come help
        me tie them up, those slate pencils that are scribbling
        in savage gangrene.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this white linen the
        spirit? I will not rattle for it, I trumpet at it. See my
        arms of metal sheet, two long trumpets.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hunger avidly intrudes:
        put an end to war. The thirst of my blood blows stiffly:
        put an end to this disgrace for mankind. My hunger and
        thirst do not relent.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come running from
        mountains, from which vile air from my brothers rises up
        to the sky, from rubble they are searching for a grave of
        earth, from wild seas that rock people in their storms,
        without respite.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thirst and hunger drone
        out of me:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh trumpet hurricane,
        annihilate the killing, seize the evil ones. Take your
        big hands and throw them at me, the international
        bayonet. Throw the profiteers and the commanders-in-chief
        onto my forest of sharp points. Those that were allowed
        to destroy us: Hand me the foul minds; decay, you hearts
        of coldness; dissolve, figments of imagination.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revolution!<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tumble into your
        outstretched arms, liberty, and the wounds that come with
        you cover us softly, like a mother's. I lie still and
        fearless when you enter, you with the many heads,
        liberty, with singing hearts and hands.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revolution, you song
        suppressed in our throats, now liberated, sing to reach
        those who feel, break out of the dead who died wishing
        and dreaming, and come into our world.</p>
