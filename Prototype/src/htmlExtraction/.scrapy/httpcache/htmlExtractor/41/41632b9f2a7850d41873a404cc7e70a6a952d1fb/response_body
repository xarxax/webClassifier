        Palmyra's streets and you<br>
        Forests of columns in the level desert<br>
        What are you now?<br>
        Your crowns, because<br>
        You crossed the boundary<br>
        Of breath,<br>
        Were taken off<br>
        In Heaven's smoke and flame;<br>
        But I sit under clouds (each one<br>
        Of which has peace) among<br>
        The ordered oaks, upon<br>
        The deer's heath, and strange<br>

        Beneficent conversation...</font></p>

        The music of your life is dying away<br>
        Beyond my hearing and all the songs<br>
        That worked a miracle of peace once on</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia">My heart, where are they now? It
        was long ago,<br>
        So long and the youth I was has aged nor is<br>
        Even the earth that smiled at me then<br>
        The same. Farewell. Live with that word always.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia">For the soul goes from me to
        return to you<br>
        Day after day and my eyes shed tears that they<br>

        Sent me out into life where I go my comrade's<br>
        Image goes with me wherever I suffer and build, with love<br>
        Unto death; for I learned this and have this from her.</font></p>

        me in sorrow, with me in faith<br>
        And heart and loyalty struggling for better times!<br>
        For such we are! And if ever in the coming years they
        knew<br>
        Of us two when the spirit matters again<br>
        They would say: lovers in those days, alone, they created<br>
        Their secret world that only the gods knew. For who<br>
        Cares only for things that will die the earth will have
        them, but<br>
        Nearer the light, into the clarities come<br>
        Those keeping faith with the heart's love and holy spirit
        who were<br>
        Hopeful, patient, still, and got the better of fate.</font></p>

        Flowed through by a hundred streams<br>
        And trees in plenty, white with blossom or reddish<br>
        And the darker, deep, full green, the wild trees<br>
        And the Alps of Switzerland overshadow you too,<br>

        Is where you live and you can hear<br>

        <p><font color="#008000" size="2" face="Georgia">From the
        back cover of <em>Friedrich Hölderlin Selected Poems</em>:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia">FRIEDRICH HÖLDERLIN (1770-1843)
        was one of Europe's greatest poets. The strange and
        beautiful language of his late poems is recreated by
        David Constantine in these remarkable verse translations.
        This is a new edition of Constantine's widely-praised
        HÖLDERLIN Selected Poems, containing several new
        translations, including one of the great elegy <i>Bread
        and Wine.</i> The odes and hymns are more fully
        represented and there are further extracts, in an
        equivalent English, from Hölderlin's extraordinary
        German versions of Sophocles. Notes on the poems have
        also been expanded. This new volume is a stimulating
        introduction to the work of a poet who, writing around
        1800, addresses us ever more urgently as the millenium
        ends.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia">'Hölderlin is a poet we can read
        with our own atrocious times in mind. He is a deeply
        religious poet whose fundamental tenet is absence and the
        threat of meaninglessness. He confronted hopelessness as
        few writers have, he was what Rilke called
        &quot;exposed&quot;; but there is no poetry like his for
        the constant engendering of hope, for the expression, in
        the body and breath of poems, of the best and most
        passionate aspirations' - David Constantine</font></p>
        <p><font face="Georgia">'Constantine goes for an
        &quot;equivalence of spirit&quot; in a more familiar
        idiom. This is at once a bold and humble undertaking, and
        has produced poetry of a remarkable luminosity and
        intensity, written in rhythms and cadences which
        recreate, both in their extremities of grief and their
        urgent hope, the immediacy of the original' - Karen
        Leeder, <i>Oxford Poetry</i></font></p>
        <hr>
        <p><font size="2" face="Georgia">David Constantine has
        published five books of poems, three translations and a
        novel with Bloodaxe. His latest poetry books are <i>Selected
        Poems</i> (1991), a Poetry Book Society Recommendation,
        and <i>Caspar Hauser</i> (1994), a poem in nine cantos.
        His co-translations include editions of Henri Michaux and
        Philippe Jaccottet in the Bloodaxe Contemporary French
        Poets series. His critical introduction to the poetry of
        Friedrich Hölderlin was published in 1988, and his
        translation of Goethe's novel <i>Elective Affinities</i>
        in 1994, both from OUP. He is Fellow in German at the
        Queen's College, Oxford.</font></p>
