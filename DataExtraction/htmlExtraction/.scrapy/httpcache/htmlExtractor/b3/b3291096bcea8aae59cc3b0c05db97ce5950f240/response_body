<dt><font size="+1">T</font>O what purpose, April, do you return again?
<dt>Beauty is not enough.
<dt>You can no longer quiet me with the redness
<dt>Of little leaves opening stickily.
<dt>I know what I know.
<dt>The sun is hot on my neck as I observe
<dt>The spikes of the crocus.
<dt>The smell of the earth is good.
<dt>It is apparent that there is no death.
<dt>But what does that signify?
<dt>Not only under ground are the brains of men
<dt>Eaten by maggots.
<dt>Life in itself
<dt>Is nothing,
<dt>An empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted stairs.
<dt>It is not enough that yearly, down this hill,
<dt>April
<dt>Comes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers.

<dt><font size="+1">A</font>H, could I lay me down in this long grass
<dt>And close my eyes, and let the quite wind
<dt>Blow over me--I am so tired, so tired
<dt>Of passing pleasant places! All my life,
<dt>Following Care along the dusty road,
<dt>Have I looked back at loveliness and sighed;
<dt>Yet at my hand an unrelenting hand
<dt>Tugged ever, as I passed. All my life long
<dt>Over my shoulder have I looked at peace;
<dt>And now I would fain lie in this long grass
<dt>And close my eyes.<p>
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet Onward!
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cat-birds call
<dt>Through the long afternoon, and creeks at dusk
<dt>Are gutteral. Whip-poor-wills wake and cry,
<dt>Drawing the twilight close about their throats.
<dt>Only my heart makes answer. Eager vines
<dt>Go up the r7ocks and wait; flushed apple-trees
<dt>Pause in their dance and break the ring for me;
<dt>Dim, shady wood-roads, redolent of fern
<dt>And bayberry, that through sweet bevies thread
<dt>Of round-faced roses, pink and petulant,
<dt>Look back and beckon ere they dissappear.
<dt>Only my heart, only my heat responds.<p>
<dt>Yet, ah, my path is sweet on either side
<dt>All through the dragging day,--sharp underfoot
<dt>And hot, and like dead mist the dry dust hangs--
<dt>But far, oh, far as passionate eye can reach,
<dt>And long, ah, long as rapturous eye can cling,
<dt>The world is mine: blue hill, still silver lake,
<dt>Broad field, bright flower, and the long white road;
<dt>A gateless garden, and an open path;
<dt>My feet to follow, and my heart to behold.
