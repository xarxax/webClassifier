A man in a long leather coat stands on his fourth-floor balcony on Kramgasse overlooking the Zahringer Fountain and the white street below.

<a href="world1.html">He decides not to visit her again.</a>
<p>
<a href="world2.html">He decides that he must see the Fribourg woman again.</a>
<p>
<a href="world3.html">He also decides that he must see her again.</a>
