Lipari Foods LLC has purchased Waterloo, Wis.- based Jim&#39;s Cheese LLC, the Warren-based food distributor announced Monday.<br />
<br />
Lipari bought the cheese cutting and packaging firm to grow its manufacturing business, according to a news release. The Wisconsin cheese supplier will fall under Lipari&#39;s JLM Manufacturing division.<br />
<br />
Terms of the deal were not disclosed. A Lipari representative did not immediately respond to further questions.<br />
<br />
The distributor has grown through acquisitions in recent years. It purchased assets of Taylor-based Dairy Fresh Foods Inc.&nbsp;in August for an undisclosed price. And&nbsp;in early 2015, it bought Bridgeville, Pa.-based Clover Mountain Foods LLC for $16 million, expanding its service area and enabling it to become a top distributor of specialty foods and high-demand fresh foods found in the bakery, dairy, deli, seafood, meat, beverage, convenience food and other &quot;perimeter of the store&quot; product areas.<br />
<br />
It also bought Sun Prairie, Wis.-based Soderholm Wholesale Foods Inc. for $4 million in late 2014.<br />
<br />
Lipari was&nbsp;working toward&nbsp;a $39.4 million expansion of its Warren site as of the end of 2016. The Lipari representative didn&#39;t immediately respond to a request for an update on the project.<br />

Lipari Foods, Warren, Mich., acquired several assets of Dairy Fresh Foods, Inc., Taylor, Mich., including the&nbsp;Dairy Fresh&nbsp;brand, effective Aug. 11.<br />
<br />
This opportunity expands Lipari&rsquo;s product breadth and fulfills another strategic goal for the company&mdash;to be one of the premier &ldquo;perimeter of the store and specialty grocery&rdquo; distributors in the United States.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;We are excited to have acquired the many brands of Dairy Fresh Foods,&rdquo; says Tony Franchi, senior vice president of sales at Lipari Foods. &ldquo;They offer great products to the marketplace and have a long history of servicing the supermarket trade. Combining what they have established with all that Lipari brings to the table means increased value for all of our customers.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
Acquiring select assets of Dairy Fresh Foods is a natural &ldquo;next step&rdquo; for Lipari, as the two companies maintain a similar product portfolio of local and national brands and share established relationships with many manufacturing partners.<br />
<br />
Lipari Foods will be integrating the acquired assets into its Warren campus, where it added 262,000 square feet of additional warehouse capacity in July. The company expects a smooth transition to the new facility, and is working to avoid any disruption to customers and their businesses.<br />

                                                    <p>
                                                        <strong>Article from Lipari Foods &quot;The Mirror&quot; Issue 39, Summer Issue 2017</strong><br />
<br />
In the past year Lipari Foods has made some big changes, not only within the organization but within the community as well. &nbsp;Back in 2015, the company made the decision to expand its footprint with the construction of a state-of-the-art frozen warehouse facility across the street from the existing distribution center on Bunert Rd. &nbsp;This came about in response to the need for additional warehouse square footage, particularly space that was close to the current headquarters on Bunert Road. &nbsp;Partnering with Ashley Capital, Lipari Foods acquired two auto salvage yards on the east side of Bunert to construct the facility. The acquisition of this land provided over 17 acres to build an efficient new specialty freezer warehouse. Teaming up with The Tippman Group who constructed the main distribution center on Bunert in 2006, it&rsquo;s projected that the building will be fully operational by the end of July 2017. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Because of the construction of this facility and the added distribution capabilities it represents, Lipari anticipates the creation of over 300 direct and indirect jobs across the network. The new warehouse space is larger and more ambitious than any other of the Lipari facilities to date. &nbsp;It will stand 36 feet tall and house 252,000 square feet, providing an entire extra layer of pallet storage more than the main warehouse now! It will also feature 27 truck bays to unload and load product onto its climate-controlled dock. &nbsp;Because of this additional space and where it is located, the frozen inventory currently found at the main warehouse will be relocated to this facility. &nbsp;The construction of this building will also allow Lipari Foods to move much of the inventory from the other remote warehouses, such as DFL Logistics in Detroit, to the new building and back to the main distribution center. &nbsp;Having most of the inventory on Bunert Road will result in enhanced shipping efficiencies due to the proximity of the warehouses. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re excited to have this new space online soon!
