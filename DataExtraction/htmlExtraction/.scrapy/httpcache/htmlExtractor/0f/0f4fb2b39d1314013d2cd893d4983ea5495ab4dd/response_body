<P><A NAME="rbly1"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>A Dream of Suffocation</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Accountants hover over the earth like helicopters,<BR>
Dropping bits of paper engraved with Hegel's name.<BR>
Badgers carry the papers on their fur<BR>
To their den, where the entire family dies in the night.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A chorus girl stands for hours behind her curtains<BR>
Looking out at the street.<BR>
In a window of a trucking service<BR>
There is a branch painted white.<BR>
A stuffed baby alligator grips that branch tightly<BR>
To keep away from the dry leaves on the floor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The honeycomb at night has strange dreams:<BR>
Small black trains going round and round--<BR>
Old warships drowning in the raindrop.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="The Indigo Bunting"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>The Indigo Bunting</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I go to the door often.<BR>
Night and summer. Crickets<BR>
lift their cries.<BR>
I know you are out.<BR>
You are driving<BR>
late through the summer night.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I do not know what will happen.<BR>
I have no claim on you.<BR>
I am one star<BR>
you have as guide; others<BR>
love you, the night<BR>
so dark over the Azores.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>You have been working outdoors,<BR>
gone all week. I feel you<BR>
in this lamp lit<BR>
so late. As I reach for it<BR>
I feel myself<BR>
driving through the night.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I love a firmness in you<BR>
that disdains the trivial<BR>
and regains the difficult.<BR>
You become part then<BR>
of the firmness of night,<BR>
the granite holding up walls.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There were women in Egypt who<BR>
supported with their firmness the stars<BR>
as they revolved,<BR>
hardly aware<BR>
of the passage from night<BR>
to day and back to night.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I love you where you go<BR>
through the night, not swerving,<BR>
clear as the indigo<BR>
bunting in her flight,<BR>
passing over two<BR>
thousand miles of ocean.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="rbly2"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>In Danger from the Outer World</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This burning in the eyes, as we open doors,<BR>
This is only the body burdened down with leaves,<BR>
The opaque flesh, heavy as November grass,<BR>
Growing stubbornly, triumphant even at midnight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And another day disappears into the cliff,<BR>
And the Eskimos come to greet it with sharp cries--<BR>
The black water swells up over the new hole.<BR>
The grave moves forward from its ambush,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moving over the hills on black feet,<BR>
Living off the country,<BR>
Leaving dogs and sheep murdered where it slept;<BR>
Some shining thing, inside, that has served us well</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Shakes its bamboo bars--<BR>
It may be gone before we wake . . .</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="rbly3"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>Moving Inward at Last</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The dying bull is bleeding on the mountain!<BR>
But inside the mountain, untouched<BR>
By the blood,<BR>
There are antlers, bits of oak bark,<BR>
Fire, herbs are thrown down.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When the smoke touches the roof of the cave,<BR>
The green leaves burst into flame,<BR>
The air of night changes to dark water,<BR>
The mountains alter and become the sea.</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="hard to finish sentences"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>IT'S HARD FOR SOME
MEN TO FINISH SENTENCES</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sometimes a man can't say<BR>
What he . . . A wind comes<BR>
And his doors don't rattle. Rain<BR>
Comes and his hair is dry.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There's a lot to keep inside<BR>
And a lot to . . . Sometimes shame<BR>
Means we. . . Children are cruel,<BR>
He's six and his hands. . .</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Even Hamlet kept passing<BR>
The king praying<BR>
And the king said,<BR>
&quot;There was something. . . .&quot;</FONT><BR>
