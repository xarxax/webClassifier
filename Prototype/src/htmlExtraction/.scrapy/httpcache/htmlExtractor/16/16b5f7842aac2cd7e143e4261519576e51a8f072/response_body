<blockquote>SLAUGHTER: Letters four do form his name --
<br>And who sent you?
<br>BOTH: The same! The same!
<br>SLAUGHTER: He came by stealth, and unlocked my den
<br>And I have drunk the blood since then
<br>Of thrice three hundred thousand men
<br>...
<br>FAMINE: I stood in a swampy field of battle
<br>With bones and skulls I made a rattle
<br>To frighten the wolf and carrion crow
<br>And the homeless dog -- but they would not go.
<br>So off I flew: for how could I bear
<br>To see them gorge their dainty fare?
<blockquote><i>Fire, Famine and Slaughter</i></blockquote>

What the Gothic horrors were doing to the popular press of Britain in the
late Eighteenth Century, Romanticism was doing to the hallowed halls of
poetry. It was a movement that is not in any way unfamiliar to those in
the latter stages of the Twentieth Century, rising on a sudden distrust
of rationality and science, an embrace of experience over knowledge, wonder
over facts, a return to the natural world -- and the supernatural -- in preference
to man's constricted realm.
<p>Charles Lamb, William Blake, Lord Byron, John Keats, Sir Walter Scott
and poor old Percy Shelley can be counted in the number of Romanticists,
and the movement was in some ways an expansion into popularity of the so-called
'graveyard poets' earlier in the century -- <i>A Night-Piece on Death</i>,
by Thomas Parnell in 1714, <i>The Grave</i> by Robert Blair in 1743 and
<i>The Pleasures of Melancholy</i> by Thomas Warton in 1747 being prime examples.
But Romanticism itself was heralded by the anthology <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>,
published in 1798 as a collaboration between William Wordsworth and Samuel
Taylor Coleridge, friends whose earlier work blossomed into maturity upon
their meeting.
<p><table align="right" width="304" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><img SRC="../Images/Coleridge.gif" ALT="Samuel Taylor Coleridge, by Jason Towers" height=451 width=304 border=0><p class="picturecaption_r">Samuel Taylor Coleridge, by Jason Towers</td></tr></table>But first... Samuel Taylor was born on October 21st, 1772, youngest
son of a large family sired by the Vicar of Ottery and master of the Grammar
School, John Coleridge. He spent a year in the army at the age of twenty-one,
but was otherwise well-groomed for his academic career. He studied, and
wrote about, theology, morals and politics, psychology and art and music,
but his love was for literature. Old and new, the classics of Greece and
Rome, the works of many of the European countries, and the contemporary
novels of his period and friends. He read voraciously, and quite separate
from his status as poet, he is considered one of the greatest of English
critics, particularly in his 'rediscovery' of Shakespeare in the original
form. Just as a point of interest, he was also the one who coined the phrase
'the suspension of disbelief'.
<p>The young scholar met Wordsworth in 1795 and in 1797 the other poet
moved to Coleridge's town of Alfoxdon so the two could work together. The
next two years saw Coleridge's greatest period of intensity and genius.
<p>His memory for the modern audience is sustained by two of the works
of this era, the first being <i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i>. From
humble origins -- the poem had been started as a collaboration between the
two so as to earn the money needed for a trip to Linton -- sprung a work
of vast power, detailing two journeys, that of a ship cursed by the narrator's
killing of an albatross, and that of the Mariner himself, as with his long
grey beard and glittering eye he walks the world, telling his story. Perhaps
with an ending that comes close to being trite to modern ears (the conclusion
of the saga with 'be nice to animals' has always jarred for me) the story
nevertheless does full justice both to the plight of the sailor and the
power of the supernatural being's his unthinking act provokes, including
the pair Death and Life-in-Death, that dice for the Mariner's soul. While
the description of the latter is justifiably famous, the equivalent for
the former was only found in early drafts:
<blockquote><i>His</i> bones were black with many a crack,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All black and bare, I ween,
<br>Jet-black and bare, save where with rust
<br>Of mouldy damps and charnel crust
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They're patch'd with purple and green.</blockquote>
The second work is <i>Kubla Khan</i>.
<p>There is certain medical and written evidence to suggest that it is
best not to take the story of the poem's writing -- as the interrupted transcript
of an opium dream -- at strictly face value, but the work nonetheless retains
great force in its verses. It was inspired by a passage in the book <i>Purchas's
Pilgrimage</i>, and it should be said that the second half makes a lot
more sense if you read it as the author trying to recapture the images
that he wrote of in the first.
<p>Less well known but of great interest to us is <i>Christobel</i>, unfinished
but published in 1816, a purely Gothic story of the seduction of Christobel
away from her father's wishes by one Geraldine. Complete with castles,
forests and a sensuous monster (though it is never clear what manner of
creature Geraldine is, a Lamia or vampire is the best bet), the story goes
that Coleridge never finished it because he wasn't sure he liked what the
poem was saying about himself. <i>Christobel</i> was read among Coleridge's
friends, and was finally published at Lord Byron's request. And of course
there is many other works by the man, from <i>Dejection: An Ode</i>, <i>The
Devil's Thoughts</i> [<a href="#1">1</a>], <i>Frost at Midnight</i> or
the dreaded <i>This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison</i> [<a href="#2">2</a>].
<p>The Romanticism movement that Coleridge helped found was based on a
rejection of the scientific ideals of its age, but nonetheless the work
of the poet, and Coleridge in particular, is an exacting process in itself.
As well as his care and experimentation with the structure of the words
themselves (as he explains about <i>Christobel</i>, he used a variable
number of syllables but always four accents per line) he strove for accuracy
in his descriptions and fine detail in his images. His ambitions were also
incredible -- and it is perhaps there he had his greatest failing.
<p>Procrastination and laziness hampered his work and the plans he 'spawned
like a herring', remorse and despair dogged him throughout life, and he
spent many years fighting his opium addiction. He died in 1834. Sir Edmund
Chambers said of him: 'So Coleridge passed, leaving a handful of golden
poems, an emptiness in the heart of a few friends, and a will-o'-the-wisp
light for bemused thinkers' [quoted in 152]. And albatross jokes.
<blockquote>Like one, that on a lonesome road
<br>Doth walk in fear and dread,
<br>And having once turned round walks on,
<br>And turns no more his head;
<br>Because he knows, a frightful fiend
<br>Doth close behind him tread.
<blockquote><i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>[<a NAME="1"></a>1]&nbsp; Satiric verse co-written with Robert Southey.
I can't resist but quote this stanza, though it is actually Southey's work:
<blockquote>And how then was the Devil drest?
<br>Oh! he was in his Sunday's best:
<br>His jacket was red and his breeches were blue
<br>And there was a hole where the tail came through.</blockquote>
[<a NAME="2"></a>2] Maybe that was just my English class.
