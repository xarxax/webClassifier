            <p align="CENTER"></b><font face="Arial">William R. Carr</font></font><font size="3"></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Unless you happen to be from
            north of Springfield, it may be stretching it somewhat to consider
            Coles County part of southern Illinois, but I’m willing to stretch
            things at least that far if it means claiming Coles County native
            William Cowper Brann as one of our own. Not everyone will join me in
            the desire to do this, of course. Many will not appreciate Brann as
            I do, for Brann’s wit was often as abrasive as his language was
            colorful. But his undeniable genius commands both my respect and
            admiration—even forgiveness. Yes, forgiveness—for Brann
            apparently shared what he called a popularly held view of the state
            of civilization in southern Illinois.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Early <i>Springhouse</i>
            readers may recall the article titled &quot;Egypt vs. Arkansas&quot;
            in the Mar/Apr 1984 issue. The article had been an editorial of the
            type that had made Brann famous throughout the nation. In that
            article, Brann recounts the war of words between the editor of <b>&quot;the
            journalistic Jehovah known as the <i>Carbondale Herald</i>&quot;</b>
            and an editor down Arkansas way. Brann quoted the <i>Herald</i>
            editor’s scathing description of Arkansas at length, and called it
            &quot;<b>a pretty good roast</b>,&quot; (and indeed it was!) but he
            stated he doubted its originality. He then paraphrased the
            &quot;razzle-dazzle&quot; a Missouri paper once gave Egypt—and, in
            reconstructing it, proceeded to &quot;roast&quot; Egypt quite
            unmercifully. &quot;...to call a man a son of ‘Egypt’ was
            considered an unforgivable affront to his family, and meant a fight
            or a foot-race... I can understand that, before the war, a native of
            ‘Egypt’ might feel not a little proud of a stray pickaninny
            ...because he could smuggle it across the Ohio and exchange it for
            tobacco and booze...&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Though Brann allowed that the
            people of the &quot;bad lands of southern Illinois&quot; had
            up-graded somewhat from ante-bellum times, he reminded his readers
            that &quot;<b>the evil reputation still clings to ‘Egypt.’</b>&quot;
            What was true then, of course, is still true today. The reputation
            seems to cling like hot tar—though through no particular fault of
            Brann’s. One need only read Paul Angle’s <i>Bloody Williamson</i>,
            or the first chapter of Darcy O’Brien’s <i>Murder in Little
            Egypt</i>, if any evidence is required.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Printing Brann’s &quot;Egypt
            vs. Arkansas&quot; article was a rather daring thing for a magazine
            like <i>Springhouse</i>. At least the editors thought so at the
            time. Though not nearly as attention-getting as recent articles on
            the Old Slave House, Brann’s stinging prose earned <i>Springhouse</i>
            some criticism—but not nearly as much as hoped for. But one
            elderly reader, (who I fear is no longer with us) actually
            remembered Brann, and remembered him well and rather fondly I
            believe.</font></font><font size="1"></p>

               &quot;You have finally unearthed the Great Iconoclast Brann (The

               </font></b><font size="3">
            </blockquote>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">It was Gary DeNeal, (then <i>Springhouse</i>
            associate editor) who revealed Brann to me. It followed a chance
            purchase of some books he’d made at a local auction. That chance
            encounter brought the &quot;Wizard of Words&quot; to the pages of
            the <i>Springhouse</i>—and thus again to the attention of Egypt,
            if not the world. &quot;Egypt vs. Arkansas,&quot; while a fair
            example of Brann’s more colorful editorial style, is nonetheless
            hardly the definitive piece by which he should be judged. The only
            thing that recommended it to the editors of the <i>Springhouse</i>
            was its reference to &quot;Egypt.&quot;—that, admittedly, in a
            most disparaging way. Though the disparagement was not supposed to
            be Brann’s own, but that of a Missouri newspaper, the Texas Terror
            was on the editorial attack against the editor of the Carbondale <i>Herald</i>
            in defense of &quot;Poor old Rackensack.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">I’ll have to admit it was
            mainly the wild-west manner of Brann’s death that sparked my
            interest. My initial thought was, &quot;Why hasn’t this colorful
            character been immortalized in western legend? Here was our own
            Illinois-born western gun-fighter and frontier editor, and nobody
            knows about him!&quot; Gary had loaned me his Brann texts while the
            editors of <i>Springhouse</i>, (which at that time included myself)
            pondered whether to print &quot;Egypt vs. Arkansas.&quot; The more I
            read, the more amazed and interested I became. Forget that he died
            in a gun-battle. Here was a man who ought to be remembered on his
            writing accomplishments alone.</font></font><b><font size="4"></p>

            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">In 1898, exactly a hundred
            years ago this April 1<sup>st</sup>, a native of southern Illinois
            was, as we might say today, &quot;terminated with great
            prejudice,&quot; on the streets of Waco, Texas. Perhaps it is time,
            on this centennial anniversary of the event, to take a second look
            at one of our once widely celebrated, but now long forgotten, native
            sons.</font></b></i></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">It was a typical Spring day in
            the bustling town of Waco. The streets were crowded with Friday’s
            early evening activity. The saloons and shops where busy. Men stood
            on corners and in doorways in idle conversation. Women bustled in
            and out of shops. Children played their idle-time games, running and
            laughing. The sounds of horse’s hooves, and the rattling of wagons
            and buggies, could be heard. A streetcar clanged and jostled in its
            tracks, stopping now and then to discharge or load passengers. There
            was no hint of tension in the air. There was no indication that
            trouble was brewing.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Two men, W. C. Brann and W. H.
            Ward, (familiar figures on the streets of Waco) were seen walking
            side by side, talking amiably as they ambled down Fourth Street.
            They were well-dressed men, appropriately appointed in the style of
            the day. They were tall, Texas men, lean and handsome, in
            wide-brimmed hats. They were proud and exuberant men, full of life,
            ambition, and purpose. They were men with dreams—men with
            promising futures. Their joint prospects were about to undergo a
            radical and abrupt change.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The two had just passed the
            door of the business office of one Tom E. Davis—a real estate man.
            When they were perhaps ten paces beyond, in front of the adjoining
            newsstand, Davis emerged from his office door, revolver in hand.
            Without warning, he fired into the back of one of the two men
            walking away from him. The bullet penetrated deeply into the one he
            knew as W. C. Brann. At the sharp report, followed almost
            immediately by several others, the men, women, and children in the
            street scrambled for cover, diving into doorways and ducking behind
            corners. They knew the sound all too well. As recently as the
            previous November 19th, a similar shooting had occurred, killing
            two, permanently maiming another, and injuring an innocent
            bystander.*</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The wounded man both heard and
            felt the shot that would kill him within hours. But he neither dove
            for cover nor knelt for mercy. He turned to face his assailant,
            drawing his Colt as he did so. Above the haze of blue smoke, he
            immediately recognized his adversary—a bitter enemy of
            long-standing. One can only imagine the thoughts that must have
            passed through Davis’s mind as he unexpectedly made eye-contact
            with the gaping bore of Brann’s weapon. He didn’t have much time
            to reflect, for no sooner had that startling discovery been made,
            than Brann’s pistol began to bark. When it did, Davis felt a
            searing pain in his breast, and the would-be killer, who had thought
            he’d accomplished his dastardly deed in relative safety, went
            down.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The <i>Waco Weekly Tribune</i>,
            of Saturday, April 2, 1898, continues the account:</font></p>
            <blockquote>
               <b>
               <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">...the first shot was fired
               by Davis, and it was immediately returned by Brann. Ward got
               between the two and in the firing he was shot in the right hand.
               Davis fell at the first shot from Brann’s pistol and writhed in
               agony. He soon recovered presence of mind and, raising himself
               upon his elbow returned fire, Brann standing off shooting into
               the prostrate form, while Davis</b> <b>with unsteady aim was
               returning the fire. Every bullet from the ‘Apostle’s’
               pistol found lodgment in the form of the duelist engaged with
               him. All was excitement. It was an hour, 6 P.M. when South Fourth
               Street was crowded, and the rapid report of the pistols caused a
               stampede of pedestrians, each of which feared contact with a
               stray bullet... Police Officer Sam S. Hall... standing... not
               forty feet away... turned at the first report, and seeing the
               duel in progress, bravely made his way toward the men... Officer
               Dave Durie was across the street, and he started also, but
               Officer Hall reached them first, but too late. Each man had
               finished shooting, Davis had fallen back upon the pavement and
               his pistol rolled from his hand. Brann was standing pistol in
               hand, its six chambers empty, looking upon the lengthened form of
               his antagonist. He had not spoken. Wounded in three places, blood
               was soiling his linen and clothes. He was yet upon his feet, and
               Officer Hall, not knowing how serious were his wounds, started
               with him the city hall...</font></p>
               <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Davis was wounded in many
               places. Bullets had plowed their way through flesh and bone, and
               unable himself to move, blood flowing freely from various wounds,
               his friends lifted him tenderly and gave him comfort as best they
               could, surgeons responding quickly to the call.</font></p>
               <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Ward had been in the midst
               of the fray, but received but one wound, in the hand. He was
               between the two men at one time and then sought safety against
               the wall. When the smoke cleared away he went to the Old Corner
               drug store to have his hand dressed. Here he was arrested later
               by Deputy-Sheriff James Lockwood.</font></p>
               <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">During the shooting... a

            two and a half, and Reverend Brann placed his son with a Mr. and
            Mrs. Hawkins, a Coles County farm family, with whom he remained for
            ten years. Though Brann always referred to his foster parents
            affectionately, he left their care early in search of adventure in
            1868, at the age of 13. His first job was as a bell boy at a hotel,
            probably in St. Louis. He learned the trades of painter and grainer,
            then printer and reporter. Finally, after the required period of
            self-education, he became an editorial writer. As such, he is said
            to have become well-known throughout Illinois and Missouri before
            finally settling in Texas. At one point, according to at least one
            account, he was ordained a Baptist minister, but to quote Brann
            himself: &quot;I came very near being a Baptist... but reneged when
            an attempt was made to baptize me in cracked ice on a winter’s
            day.&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">For an untutored farm boy from
            the prairie lands of Illinois, Brann could by then already be
            considered something of a success, merely &quot;driving a pen&quot;
            for others. At any rate, he was making a living, and successful
            enough by 1877 to take a wife in the person of a Miss Carrie Martin,
            on March 3rd, at Rochelle, Illinois, (Ogle county, west of Chicago).
            Yet years of struggle and poverty remained before he would become
            known as the Great Iconoclast and enjoy a degree of editorial
            freedom and financial success.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">It was July of 1891 when the
            first issue of Brann’s <i>Iconoclast</i> appeared in Austin,
            Texas. Unfortunately, the enterprise failed after only a few issues.
            Interestingly, one of Brann’s admirers is remembered by today’s
            world, and may have owed some of his success and writing style to W.
            C. Brann. William Sydney Porter, better known as O. Henry, was at
            that time a drug clerk in Austin. Having literary aspirations of his
            own, Porter jumped at the chance to get into publication. Purchasing
            Brann’s press and the <i>Iconoclast</i> name for $250.00, Porter
            attempted to keep the paper alive with his own brand of journalism.
            The <i>Iconoclast</i> fared no better in O. Henry’s hands than in
            Brann’s, however, and failed after only two issues. Later on, in
            1894, Porter started a humorous weekly called <i>The Rolling Stone</i>.
            It too failed, and he became a <i>Houston Post</i> reporter before
            ultimately becoming a literary icon in his own right. Meanwhile,
            Brann had resumed editorial work at the <i>Globe Democrat</i> at St.
            Louis, and later at the <i>Express</i> of San Antonio.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">In the Summer of 1894, Brann
            and his family, settled in Waco, Texas, where he went to work as an
            editorial writer for the <i>Waco Daily News</i>. He obtained
            permission from William Porter to resume the <i>Iconoclast</i> name
            and reestablished the publication in 1895. His renewed effort was
            successful from the first issue. That a newspaper like the <i>Iconoclast</i>
            could have attained much success at all in a small western town,
            alongside already established papers, was amazing. That by the time
            of Brann’s untimely death, the <i>Iconoclast</i> had attained a
            circulation of 90,000 was nothing short of miraculous. The <i>Iconoclast</i>
            enjoyed a readership that rivaled many of the big city dailies and
            magazines of the time, and Brann’s name, along with that of his
            paper, gained national renown. He was reviled by many, but loved by
            many more. But even his most ardent detractors never missed an issue
            of the <i>Iconoclast</i>, for if they were not being
            &quot;roasted&quot; they wanted to know who was. Additionally, Brann
            had become a much sought-after lecturer, and traveled far and wide
            speaking to a surprising assortment of groups, in addition to
            carrying on his publishing and editorial duties.</font></p>

            </font><font size="3">
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Before Brann came to town,
            Waco had been best known as the proud home of Baylor University.
            After Brann’s arrival, Waco became much more widely known as the
            home of the lively <i>Iconoclast</i> newspaper and its fiery editor.
            While Brann would have liked nothing better than to sing the praises
            of Baylor, and stay on the right side of its venerable
            administrators, he found it impossible to do so. He wasn’t one to
            automatically worship at the feet of college administrators merely
            because they cloaked themselves in the lordly garments of academia
            and Christian righteousness. He had a problem with hypocrites, and
            soon observed that Baylor had at least its fair share of the breed.
            Brann hadn’t hastened to sanctify the <i>Iconoclast</i> by
            glorifying Baylor. In fact, Brann found his paper boycotted by
            Baylor official edict even before it had a chance. This being so,
            there were those at the university, and city hall, who came
            increasingly to resent Brann’s presence. Some found his growing
            influence and popularity alarming, and seized every opportunity to
            undermine his standing in the community. He was attacked as a
            sinner, an atheist, and an anarchist.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Thus, relations between Brann
            and the Baylor faculty were strained from the beginning. Waco was
            too small for an Iconoclast of Brann’s audacity and a Christian
            university to coexist without a certain amount of conflict. For some
            time the conflict was rather innocuous and sometimes even almost
            amiable, at least on Brann’s part. Eventually, however, a scandal
            surfaced at the university concerning a certain young female
            student. She was an orphan from Brazil who had been taken under
            Baylor’s wing at the age of eleven. Taken into the chief
            administrator’s household, at age 14 she was found to be, ah, with
            child. Such things do happen sometimes—even in upstanding
            Christian colleges. But Brann considered the manner with which the
            administration subsequently handled the matter deplorable. They
            dumped her into the street and didn’t bother to find out who the
            guilty party was. Instead, she was falsely accused of having had an
            amorous affair with a Negro. The <i>Iconoclast</i> took up the young
            lady’s cause and, in so doing, publicly exposed a lack of
            morality, or at least criminal negligence, on the part of the young
            lady’s guardian. Baylor suffered a humiliating black eye before
            the entire nation, thanks to Brann. Discretion might well have
            proven the better part of valor in the case, but Brann was incapable
            of conforming to that mold. When the guilty were free and the
            innocent condemned, Brann could not be silent. The Brann-Baylor
            relationship was thus soured beyond repair. But it remained for
            another &quot;affair&quot; to turn the relationship really
            ugly—and ultimately deadly.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The beginning of the end for
            Brann was the day Baylor University imported a lecturer by the name
            Joseph Slattery. Brann attended one of Slattery’s lectures.
            Slattery, an ex-Catholic priest married to an ex-nun, (who was
            reputed to have been kicked out of the Church for reasons of gross
            immorality) proceeded to &quot;roast&quot; the Catholic Church
            unmercifully. Brann, to be sure, was no more a proponent of
            Catholicism than he was a champion of the Baptist cause. But he was
            a champion of truth and decency. When Slattery slandered Catholic
            nuns in a most shocking and unforgivable way, the Apostle was
            outraged. He arose, pointed his finger at Slattery, and said,
            &quot;You lie and you know it, and I refuse to listen to you.&quot;
            He then turned and walked out amid the hoots and hisses of the
            audience, consisting mostly of the faculty and future Baptist
            ministers. He came close to being mobbed right then.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Brann then hired the same
            opera house and replied to Slattery. He also replied on the pages of
            the <i>Iconoclast</i>, of course. He roasted Slattery, and Baylor
            for having invited him to town. In taking Baylor to task for
            catering to the likes of Slattery, Brann made a comment to the
            effect that Baylor was manufacturing &quot;ministers and
            Magdalens.&quot; This gave Brann’s enemies the handle they would
            flay him with, by making people believe Brann had equated all of
            Baylor’s female students with Magdalen—an outrageous and
            unforgivable insult that required action. That it was intended as a
            jab at the University’s administration, no longer mattered.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">To the use of that single
            word, &quot;Magdalens,&quot; are attributed two mob actions against
            the Apostle, as Baylor’s male &quot;students&quot; answered the
            call. In the first instance, Brann’s home was invaded by a mob who
            sought to kidnap him. Not finding him there, they found him in town
            and proceeded to administer their brand of &quot;saving grace&quot;
            with ropes, revolvers, and cudgels. He was pistol-whipped; stripped;
            spat upon; pulled around the campus with a rope around his neck;
            almost lynched; (for that had apparently had been their intention)
            and finally forced to sign a &quot;confession&quot; and apology.
            Bloody and shaken, Brann was then ordered to agree to leave town. In
            the second instance, he had been waylaid on the street from behind
            one night by several men. He was pistol-whipped, reminded that he
            had a redemptive train to catch, and then cudgeled senseless. Of
            course, Brann didn’t leave town—after recuperating for a few
            days with his &quot;head in a sling,&quot; as he put it, he fought
            back with his pen with renewed vigor and with devastating,
            (ultimately suicidal) effect. He continued to publish the <i>Iconoclast</i>
            and &quot;roast&quot; the parties who were giving Baylor University
            a bad name.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">The man who killed Brann had a
            daughter in attendance at Baylor, and had joined the frenzied chorus
            demanding Brann’s exile from Waco. Apparently frustrated at
            Brann’s failure to make tracks, he took it upon himself to send
            Brann on a permanent journey. He succeeded by shooting a brave man
            in the back. As a reward, Brann’s own six-shooter answered,
            joining that powerful refrain to which he had oft referred when
            writing of cowards and gun play &quot;...bullets sweetly singing
            ‘Nearer My God to Thee.’&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">So Brann was killed and his
            murderer immediately repaid in Texas change, a judicial transaction
            Brann himself had often held was necessary when nothing else would
            do. The only justice, beyond that of the moment, was that Brann died
            in peace, and his murderer died less pleasantly. Both bereaved
            families paid an equal price, and the world lost a great man.</font></p>

            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Along with the mourning which
            followed Brann’s death, words of condemnation and praise
            reverberated around the nation in the editorial pages. From sea to
            sea, from the Rio Grande to the Canadian border, editors and
            journalists remembered Brann the Iconoclast. Some were sad, some
            were mad, and others glad. A few seized the opportunity to step on
            his memory, smugly secure in the knowledge that his virile pen had
            been stilled forever. But even some of his detractors rose to
            eloquence on the occasion of his passing, admitting a great loss,
            and praising his genius. Words of praise were many—in fact it
            would be difficult to imagine a single mortal ever receiving more
            numerous and glowing tributes than those that were heaped upon Brann
            in the days and weeks following his death.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Here are the kind of comments
            that appeared in papers across the nation.</font></p>

            were human; his virtues Godlike.&quot; &quot;They could better spare

            hater of shams and defied every form of fraud, hypocrisy and
            deceit.&quot; &quot;Every evildoer and hypocrite feared him, while
            the upright men and virtuous women had a champion in him.&quot;
            &quot;Brann was an intellectual giant.&quot; &quot;In the tragic
            death of W. C. Brann the world has lost the most versatile pen the
            century has produced...&quot; &quot;Stilled is the heart that stood
            alone, defiant, a bulwark ’gainst the wave of corruption that is
            engulfing our land.&quot; &quot;His faith was broad as the
            universe—deep as infinity. He loved purity; he hated hypocrisy;
            and for this he died—a martyr.&quot; &quot;Scorning the sensual,
            always against the vulgar, in much the manner of Carlyle, Brann
            struck the gaffes of truth deep into the sides of wrong in high
            places, and exposed rottenness wherever found.&quot; &quot;Brann
            attacked hypocritic preachers, snide politicians, shoddy social
            people, and shyster lawyers.&quot;</font></p>

            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Though from Coles County,
            Illinois, Brann was a Southerner, and recognized as such in Texas
            and elsewhere. Because he was born and raised near the home of
            Abraham Lincoln, who was of Kentucky origin, some associated Brann
            with Kentucky. William Marion Reedy, of <i>The St. Louis Mirror</i>,
            was one. In the April 7, 1898 issue, he wrote:</font></p>
            <blockquote>
               <b>
               <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">His mind was on a Texas
               scale; he knew no meanness. His was Kentucky origin and he was
               tainted with Kentucky’s Quixotism. He loved liberty... His
               following included all the thinking followers of Bryan and his
               work had no little effect, in its powerful music and color, upon
               many people to whom Bryanism represented the political
               abomination of desolation... He died as he expected to die,
               without any cringing to his enemies... He partook of the
               qualities of the men who immortalized the Alamo. He was the first
               man who identified Texas with thought... With all his faults as I
               see them, I can think of him only as worthy of being buried in
               some high place, to the strains of Sigfried’s Funeral March...</font></b></p>

            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Another, perhaps more reticent
            about singing Brann’s praises, was Elbert Hubbard, editor of the <i>Philistine</i>.
            Nevertheless, Hubbard’s praise was published in the April 14th
            issue of <i>The St. Louis Mirror</i>. It appeared under the unlikely
            title of &quot;BRANN, THE FOOL.&quot; &nbsp;</font></p>

               as much as a common newspaper, and the people who bought it read
               it until it was worn out. All the things in this paper were not

               </b>
            </blockquote>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">In 1898—one hundred years
            ago, on what we now call April Fools’ Day—a Brave Heart was cut
            down. For all Brann’s enemies who called Waco home, they were but
            a relative few compared to his friends. His funeral was more heavily
            attended than any other that city had ever known. Brann was laid to
            rest in Waco’s Oakwood Cemetery. He was survived by his wife
            Carrie, and two children—daughter Grace, and son, William Carlyle.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Brann’s friends desperately
            wanted the <i>Iconoclast</i> newspaper to live on in his memory, and
            they wanted to continue his work. But they soon apparently
            determined any attempt to fill Apostle’s shoes would be hopeless
            folly. They must have realized that no one among them, nor any
            combination of them, would ever be up to the task. Without Brann,
            the fire would be gone, and the <i>Iconoclast</i> would become a
            pale shadow of what it had been. W. H. Ward, and the <i>Iconoclast</i>
            employees issued only one edition of the <i>Iconoclast</i> following
            Brann’s death. It was a fitting memorial to the man—and
            Brann’s <i>Iconoclast</i> closed its doors forever.</font></p>
            <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial">Those interested in learning
            more about Brann the Iconoclast, will be happy to learn that his
            works are being re-published on the Information Superhighway, thanks
            to the endeavors of Guttenberg Project volunteers, and the
            University of Virginia Electronic Library. Volumes I, X, and XII of <i>The
            Complete Works of Brann The Iconoclast </i>are now available and may
            be found at <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/uvaonline.html">http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/uvaonline.html</a>.</font></p>

            The cause of the previous shooting, in which Col. Gerald killed the
            Harris brothers, was in some way related to Brann’s difficulties.
            Col. Gerald was one of Brann’s friends, &quot;a wonderful old
            man...over sixty...straight as a pine... a light mustache and chin
            beard, and eyes the color of the blue you see in old china. He
            don’t know what fear is...thinks it is some kind of disease like
            smallpox or appendicitis...&quot;</font></p>
