    <i><font color="#008080" face="Arial" size="2">A portion of this interview was published

    Senning:</font><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2"> I would like to start with
    language poetry itself. Part of the myth of language poetry is that it is fundamentally
    nonrepresentational. There are connections drawn between abstract expressionism in
    painting and language poetry, both of which many have thought are the baring of these art
    forms to their basic units. Line and word. However, as recent criticism has attempted to
    prove that New York painters Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko had actual subject matter in
    mind as they painted, will we find the same to be true in language poetry?</font><font
    color="#000000"></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"></font><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial" size="2">Charles Bernstein:</font><font
    color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2"> From my very first essays in the 1970s (collected
    in <i>Content&#146;s Dream)</i> I have argued against the idea that the sort of poetry we
    explored, for example in <i>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</i>, was nonreferential. Words are almost
    always referential, but what many of us were interested in exploring were nonconventional
    forms, allowing the expressive (and nonexpressive) features of language to roam in
    different territory than possible with tamer verse forms. So what you get might better be
    called polyreferential in that the poems do not necessarily mean one fixed, definable,
    paraphrasable thing. Visual representation typically concerns whether or not a painting
    &#145;&#145;looks like&#146;&#146; something identifiable&#151;a landscape, a person, a
    bowl of Rice Krispies. But what if what is being represented is not a bowl of soup but the
    soup bowl inside your mind. Then again, what happens if that obscure object of
    representation is not being represented but created in the process, so it is not a report
    of some thing seen or known outside the poem but an act of making.</font><font
    color="#000000"></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"></font><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial" size="2">BS:</font><font
    color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2"> First, please give our readers a basic definition
    of language poetry, then tell us if your vision of it is, as one critic noted,
    representational.</font><font color="#000000"></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"></font><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial" size="2">CB:</font><font
    color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2"> While this term has come in to wide use, I prefer
    to talk about the specific feature of my own work or other works I respond to, rather than
    take on the task of making generalizations. How many generalizations can dance on the head
    of pin and can you increase the number if it is a digital pin?</font><font color="#000000"></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I go into my sense of this a bit in <i>My Way:
    Speeches and Poems, </i>my new book from the University of Chicago Press<i>. </i>Indeed,
    the term you ask about refers to an extremely diverse and even conflicting series of works
    that depart from conventional poetic practices. There isn't one kind of form, one kind of
    style, or one kind of approach that interested us in <i>L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E</i>, the magazine
    Bruce Andrews and I edited from 1978 to 1981. Just as now there is not a single form,
    style, or approach that can characterize the related tendencies in contemporary North
    American poetry that are sometimes labeled in this way. As Bruce and I wrote in our
    introduction to <i>The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Book</i>, we were interested in poetry that did not
    assume a syntax, a subject matter, a vocabulary, a structure, a form, or a style but where
    all these were at issue, all these were explored in the writing of the poem. In the 70s,
    much of the then conventional poetry relied on the use of a consistent
    &#145;&#145;voice&#146;&#146;, but if such-voice-centered poetry was rejected it
    wasn&#146;t to deny voices or voicing or even speech but to allow them to be newly
    discovered in the poem. The assumption that a poem must always have the concept of a
    speaking voice narrating its feeling &#133; well that seemed and still seems an awfully
    narrow mandate for verbal art. I think we wanted to put the art part back in poetry, which
    means considering many different ways that one word can follow another, one phrase can
    collide or merge with the next. And many different types of language. Indeed, to compose
    poems with widely variant forms of language&#151;to make a rhythm from the variations in
    the types of language used.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"></font><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial" size="2">BS:</font><font
    color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2"> You&#146;ve written somewhere about poetry as
    dissent, both against the formal norms of poetry and social norms, yet your poetry uses
    the language of technology and pop culture. How does your poetry reconcile this
    simultaneous dissent and acceptance?</font><font color="#000000"></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"></font><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial" size="2">CB:</font><font
    color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2"> You are raising a familiar philosophical problem of
    how you can critique that which you are inside of and I feel myself very much inside the
    culture that I still want to question. One thing is to realize that dissent is a process
    and not a final and objective state, some dictate of truth from on high. I want to engage
    the materials of the culture, derange them as they have deranged me, sound them out, as
    they sound me out.</font><font color="#000000"></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">There is another way to approach your question
    and that is simply to note the degree that we live in a culture in which the terms and
    forms of discussion are determined for us (all Monica all the time). The range of cultural
    and historical reference and information in the mass and popular media is remarkably
    limited. Issues and idea as presented on TV and in the newspapers are stripped of
    complexity and ambiguity. And we are now in the frightening Orwellian situation where
    complexity and the aesthetic is identified as &#145;&#145;elitist&#146;&#146;. This is for
    me tantamount to saying that ethics is elitist and only consumerism is democratic.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Dissent is a form of saying no, to echo
    Dickinson&#146;s remark in a letter, &#145;&#145;Don&#146;t you know that &#145;no&#146;
    is the wildest word we consign to language.&#146;&#146; Too much of the
    &#145;&#145;popular&#146;&#146; poetry of the time is affirmative but I want an
    &#145;&#145;unpopular&#146;&#146; poetry of &#145;&#145;anaffirmation&#146;&#146; that
    expresses confusion, anger, ambiguity, distress, fumbling, awkwardness. Oddly, it is a
    form of dissent these days to hold out that art that doesn&#146;t get the market share can
    actually be as valuable as the art that does, that ideas that are hard to understand may
    have something to say that ideas you can understand can&#146;t begin to get at. I'm for
    the ketchup that loses the race.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">And then there is finally dissent toward the
    values of the economic system we live in: to the systematic maldistrbution of wealth, to
    the countenancing of poverty as an acceptable price we pay for the benefits of our
    economic success, to the fact that we seem to spend more money to lock up people than to
    educate them. We are all prisoners of the system we live in, but I would argue that the
    effects of this imprisoning pervade our language, the grammar of our everyday lives, and
    the metaphors we use to respond to the problem. Poetry may not be able to redistribute the
    wealth, but it can open up a way of&#151;again to say&#151;representing the issues that
    can change how we respond, indeed keep us responding. For the political question is never
    just what is to be done but also the formulating and reformulating of the issues: for the
    &#145;&#145;same&#146;&#146; problem represented in one way becomes a different problem
    when represented another way. I am for permuting these modes of representation, for
    running them by in serial fashion, one following another, until we get something closer to
    a holograph than the cartoon of the world that presently dominates our living room
    entertainment centers.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"></font><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial" size="2">BS:</font><font
    color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2"> Does your aesthetic jibe with what Oscar Wilde said
    about reality being shaped by art? By creating an artform that introduces complexity into
    the very language we use do you hope to raise our awareness, convolute our sense of
    reality when we are presented with other language- or image-based transmissions of
    information? Say, commercials or newspaper articles?</font><font color="#000000"></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"></font><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial" size="2">CB:</font><font
    color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2"> In Wilde&#146;s marvelous dialog &#145;&#145;The
    Critic as Artist&#146;&#146; one of the characters says it is not art that copies nature
    but the other way around. That&#146;s always been my motto. And if not Art, then Ted or
    Francine, though personally I think Larry has an in for me. Language shapes the way we
    perceive the world, that&#146;s for sure or if not for sure then for certain and if not
    those than which? One of the pleasures of poetry is inhabiting that world-creating space.
    I&#146;m not saying there is no real world (but when is the last time you heard anything
    real?) or that the world is simply a product of our language (please pass the margarine)
    but rather that the world is colored by our words, shaped by our grammar, valued by our
    metaphors. But poetry is not an illustration of philosophy and while such ideas as these
    are relevant (who are you calling an idea?), what&#146;s necessary about poems is the way
    they make their own logic, quite different than the logic of philosophical ideas about
    imitation or representation. What is it they say in elementary school about showing not
    telling, or is that acting school, I get easily confused?</font><font color="#000000"></p>
