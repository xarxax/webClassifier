<P>'What can I do for you, sir?' I asked blandly, astonished.


He was a tall broad-shouldered man in a rough pea-jacket, and


scowled portentously.




<P>'Put me into an honest livelihood,' he answered.  It was


such a strange request that I could only stare.  'Don't you


understand?' he said, seating himself with rough vehemence, 'I


want to become a reputable member of society.  I want some


honest employment.'




<P>'But, my good sir, why do you come to me?  Your motive is


most excellent, but an honest employment is the last thing at


<I>my</I> disposal.'




<P>'That be blowed!' said he, 'you could give me a fortune if


you liked, you know you could.  But I don't want that.  No, I'm


fly to that game!  You'll have some blessed elder brother, that


nobody knowed of, coming back from New Zealand and succeeding to


the ancestral mansion; or you'll get me pitched out of my gilded


chariot at the church door, and marry my wife, that ought to be,


to somebody else.  I know you.  I only want a modest competence,


nobody interfers with that.'




<P>'Your language is even more mysterious than your


appearance, my friend,' I said.




<P>'Pshaw!' said he (I never heard a man outside a book said


'pshaw' -- never), 'don't you know me?'




<P>I looked at him steadily, and it seemed that I ought to


know him, that hat, that pea-jacket, that knotted scarf around


his muscular throat, those fierce eyes -- all were familiar to


me. . .




<P>'You don't happen to have any marks about you?' I asked,


while a cold sweat broke out upon my brow.




<P>He laughed -- that bitter laugh which I had described so


often.




<P>'I have a peculiar mole on the back of my neck, the tip of


my left ear is shot away, my right side still bears the mark of


Pompey's claws when he defended his young mistress Alice in the


lonely swamp.  I have lost the little finger of my right hand,


and have three pear-shaped wens, besides the usual allowance of


strawberry marks.'




<P>There was no mistaking him.  It was my Villain!  I knew his


bloodthirsty nature, and dreaded the tremendous struggle which


experience told me was to follow.




<P>'But why come here?' I urged.




<P>'I am sick of it,' said my villain, doggedly.  'I ain't to


be badgered any more.  It ain't a respectable business.  First I


was Jabez Jamrack, then Black Will the Smuggler, then Curlewis


Carleyon, then a Poacher, then a Burglar, then an Unjust


Steward, and now I'm an Escaped Convict.'




<P>It was true.  The unhappy creature before me had figured --


in my world-renowned novels -- in all those capacities. . .




<P>'It ain't because I'm out all nights in all sorts of


weather, mostly thunderous.  It ain't because I'm often drunk,


always in debt, and totally disreputable.  It ain't because I've


murdered a large variety of mothers, and brought the grey 'airs


of a corresponding number of aged fathers with sorrow to the


grave.  It ain't because my langwidge is altogether ridiculous,


and I leave out more "h"s' and put in more oaths in my


conversation than any natural man did yet.  It ain't that.  No!'


he cried, waxing wroth, 'it's because I'm always left at the end


of the third volume, if I'm still alive, without hope of mercy


or promise of repentance.'




<P>I shuddered.




<P>'Take some brandy,' I said, and pushed him the decanter.


He took it, and filling half-a-tumbler with neat spirit drained


it at a gulp.  I knew he would.  The Beast -- under my direction


-- invariably took his liquor in that fashion . . .




<P>'Is it right?  Is it just, guvernor? . . . Your comic


servant winds up with the chambermaid.  Your aristocratic


villain, the Marquis, my master, who poisons his niece, and


shoots his aunt with an air-gun, he's <I>all right</I> . . . he's


never hung in chains, or tuk to Newgate, or starved to death in


a deserted drive on the diggings in Bend-i-go. . . But why waste


words?  Are we not alone here?  No sound but the whistling of


the wind in the wide chimneys of the moated grange; no footsteps


but that of the midnight mouser as she creeps stealthily to her


prey.  Ha, ha!  Thou art mine, and --' . . .




<P>Ha, ha, indeed!  I guessed how it would happen.  My


experience as a novel-writer told me as much.  Just as the


enraged ruffian advanced to seize me . . . a new-comer appeared


upon the scene.




<P>By his wavy hair, square-toed Wellingtons, massive watch


chain, and handkerchief that hung from the right hand pocket of


his shooting coat, I knew him at once.




<P>He was Sir Aubrey de Briancourt.




<P>'Assist me!' I exclaimed.




<P>The look of scorn he gave me was sufficient to daunt a


bolder man, but I knew of a spell by which I could compel him.




<P>'Hist!' I said, in a thrilling whisper.  'Proud scion of a


lordly house, there is another Sir Aubrey.  Refuse me aid, and


young Fairfield will assume your name and title.  These minions


are beyond my power, but remember you are to be <I>continued in


our next</I>.'




<P>The threat made pale the cheek even of one whose ancestors


had bled on Bosworth, and the baronet waved a white hand towards


the back door.




<P>'Take my cabriolet, dog!' he said, with that courtesy which


characterizes the British aristocrat. . .




<P>I need scarcely remark that I leapt into the cabriolet, and


was soon driving with the rapidity of lightning towards


Goodman's Gully.




<P>Fast behind came the echo of hooves.  The lightning flashed


incessantly, and the negro who held the reins was white with


fear.




<P>All at once a man clad in a red shirt jumped from behind a


bush and seized the head of the mare.




<P>'Who are you?' I cried.




<P>'The most abused of all,' said he.  'I am the Typical


Digger!  I am the man whom you and the others of your tribe have


made to eat banknotes as sandwiches.  I have shod my horse with


gold and swilled champagne -- which I detest -- out of stable


buckets. . . Am I to pass my life in finding repeatedly gigantic


nuggets, and being perpetually robbed of the same?  Must I never


shave?  Shall the tyranny of the fictionmonger compel me to


<I>sleep</I> in my boots?'




<P>'Calm yourself, my friend,' I said, 'There is not much harm


done.  I know of some poor fellows whom the fictionmongers have


treated much more rudely.'




<P>At that instant, the demoniac howls of my pursuers were


borne upon the blast.




<P>'That may be,' roared the Digger of Romance, 'But I will be


revenged on <I>thee</I>.  Come!'




<P>The cabriolet disappeared in the distance -- there was


never a cabriolet yet that did not do so under such


circumstances -- and my captor led me away.




<P>He paused at the door of the usual bush inn (how well I


knew it), and striking three blows upon the door (they


invariably struck three loud blows), we were admitted into a


long apartment.  I beheld with astonishment that all the


personages whom I had imagined the creatures of my own too


fertile brain were there.




<P>'Wretch!' cried the fair Madeline, 'why did you not unite


me to the Duke?  You know you only changed your mind at the last


moment.'




<P>'Monster,' said the lovely Violet, 'You made me pass three


nights of horror in the Red Farm, when one stroke of your pen


would have freed me.' . . .




<P>'Christian dog!' roared Mordecai the Jew, 'I was born with


charitable impulses, and should have lent in peace the humble


shilling upon the ragged coat of poverty, had not your felon


soul plunged me into crime to gratify the tastes of a blood-and-thunder loving 
public.'




<P>'And I,' remarked Henry Mortimer, with that cynical smile


that I had so often depicted, curling his proud lip, 'did I wish


to throw my elder brother down a well in order to succeed to his


name and heritage?  No!  I loved him fondly, madly, as you took


pains to state in your earlier chapters.' . . .




<P>'Away with him!' hissed Lady Millicent, the Poisoner.  'I


knew not of the deadly power of strychnine until he told me.'


. . .




<P>''Twas he that let me linger in consumption for forty pages


folio!' cried Coralie de Belleisle, the planter's daughter.




<P>''Twas he that blighted my voluptous contours with an


entirely unnecessary railway accident!' wept the lovely


Geraldine.




<P>'Away with him!'




<P>'Mercy!' I cried, gazing in terror on their well-known


lineaments.




<P>'Mercy!' cried the Lost Heiress, Isabelle Beaumanoir, 'when


for two long hours you deliberated whether my sainted mother or


the poacher's wife should give me birth!  Mercy for <I>thee</I>!  Oh,


no, no, no!' . . .




<P>I trembled over the abyss.




<P>'Why seek to dispel my <I>ennui</I> with this <I>espieglerie, mon


ami</I>,' said the soft tones of the Count in his native tongue.


'<I>Sacre</I>, let the <I>pauvre petit</I> escape, my <I>dejeuner</I> at the


<I>fourchette</I> awaits.  The <I>coup d'oeil</I> is superb, the <I>tout


ensemble</I> all that could be desired.  <I>Voila</I>.'




<P>The digger swung me over the yawning grave.  All the


buttons in my waistcoat gave way, and for an instant my life


hung literally by a thread.




<P>'Will you make me respectable?' said the Villain.




<P>'Never.'




<P>The button cracked.  I was going, going -- gone, when the


alarm-bell sounded, the door was burst open, and




<BLOCKQUOTE>. . .</BLOCKQUOTE>




Bridget entered.




<P>'It is the boy from the printers' for the proofs,' said


she.




<P>'Tell him to wait,' said I; and wiping the sweat from my


intellectual brow, I seized my pen, and in ten lines had got my


Villain comfortably in irons at Norfolk Island.
