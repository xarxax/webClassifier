		<HR WIDTH="75%" SIZE="1"> 
		<P> Hamond is a leading outsource manufacturer of medium to high volume high precision small
		  stamped, formed and/or tapped metal parts. We aim to be 
		  <B>your</B> premier source for custom metal stampings.</P> 
		<P>Our principal manufacturing process is slide forming, a highly specialized precision metal
		  stamping and forming process.</P> 
		<P>If fourslides and slide forming aren't familiar to you, don't be surprised. You're not
		  alone. Check out our 
		  <A HREF="what_is_a_fourslide.htm">What is a Fourslide?</A> page for more information.</P> 
		<P>For many parts, this relatively unknown process is the best process for the job. We have
		  dedicated a number of pages to 
		  <A HREF="slide_forming_introduction.htm">explaining this process in more detail</A>. We
		  also have a handy checklist to help you 
		  <A HREF="buyer_assistant.htm">decide if slide forming is the right process for your
		  job</A></P> 
		<P>We can manufacture parts from any metal commercially available in coil or wire form.
		  Typical parts we would make are from 1/2 to 11 inches long, from 0.5 to 2.5" wide, and from 0.010"
		  to 0.066" thick. Under the right circumstances, we can also go outside these limits.</P> 
		<P>We're located a few short blocks from 3 major highways (427, 401, Queen Elizabeth Way), in
		  the west end of Toronto, Canada. From here we can ship to anywhere in North America. We have 2
		  truck level docks and a drive-in bay. Shipping access is never a problem.</P> 
		<H3>Additional Services at Hamond </H3>

		<UL> 
		  <LI>operate our own tool room and build all our own tools and</LI>

		  <LI>We have recently developed 3 new tapping capabilities:

				<LI>We can put two threaded holes in a part</LI> 
				<LI>We can tap after forming, allowing us to tap near a formed bend without thread
				  distortion</LI> 
				<LI>We can tap through two material thicknesses, that is, prepunch in two places in the
				  strip, form the part so the two holes line up, and then tap through the two lined up holes.</LI>
