<ul><dl><P>
<DT><I><font size="+1">O</font>H, East is East and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,</I>
<DT><I>Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God's great Judgement Seat;</I>
<DT><I>But there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor Birth,</I>
<DT><I>When two strong men stand face to face, tho' they come from the ends of the earth!</I>
<P>
<DT>Kamal is out with twenty men to raise the Border side,
<DT>And he has lifted the Colonel's mare that is the Colonel's pride:
<DT>He has lifted her out of the stable-door between the dawn and the day,
<DT>And turned the calkins upon her feet, and ridden her far away.
<DT>Then up and spoke the Colonel's son that led a troop of the Guides:
<DT>``Is there never a man of all my men can say where Kamal hides?''
<DT>Then up and spoke Mahommed Khan, the son of the Ressaldar,
<DT>``If ye know the track of the morning-mist, ye know where his pickets are.
<DT>At dusk he harries the Abazai---at dawn he is into Borair,
<DT>But he must go by Fort Bukloh to his own place to fare,
<DT>So if ye gallop to Fort Bukloh as fast as a bird can fly,
<DT>By the favour of God ye may cut him off ere he win to the Tonuge of Jagai,
<DT>But if he be passed the Tongue of Jagai, right swiftly turn ye then,
<DT>For the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown with Kamal's men.
<DT>There is rock to the left, and rock to the right, and low lean thorn between,
<DT>And ye may hear a breech-bolt snick where never a man is seen.''
<P>
<DT>The Colonel's son has taken a horse, and a raw rough dun was he,
<DT>With the mouth of a bell and the heart of Hell, and the head of a gallows-tree.
<DT>The Colonel's son to the Fort has won, they bid him stay to eat--
<DT>Who rides at the tail of a Border thief, he sits not long at his meat.
<DT>He's up and away from Fort Bukloh as fast as he can fly,
<DT>Till he was aware of his father's mare in the gut of the Tonue of Jagai,
<DT>Till he was aware of his father's mare with Kamal upon her back,
<DT>And when he could spy the white of her eye, he made the pistol crack.
<DT>He has fired once, he has fired twice, but the whistling ball went wide.
<DT>``Ye shoot like a soldier,'' Kamal said.  ``Show now if ye can ride.''
<DT>It's up and over the Tongue of Jagai, as blown dust-devils go,
<DT>The dun he fled like a stag of ten, but the mare like a barren doe.
<DT>The dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above,
<DT>But the red mare played with the snaffle-bars, as a maiden plays with a glove.
<DT>There was rock to the left and rock to the right, and low lean thorn between,
<DT>And thrice he heard a breech-bolt snick tho' never a man was seen.
<DT>They have ridden the low moon out of the sky, their hoofs drum up the dawn,
<DT>The dun he went like a wounded bull, but the mare like a new-roused fawn.
<DT>The dun he fell at a water-course--in a woeful heap fell he,
<DT>And Kamal has turned the red mare back, and pulled the rider free.
<DT>He has knocked the pistol out of his hand--small room was there to strive,
<DT>``'Twas only by favour of mine,'' quoth he, ``ye rode so long alive:
<DT>There was not a rock for twenty mile, there was not a clump of tree,
<DT>But covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee.
<DT>If I had raised my bridle-hand, as I have held it low,
<DT>The little jackals that flee so fast were feasting all in a row:
<DT>If I had bowed my head on my breast, as I have held it high,
<DT>The kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly.''
<DT>Lightly answered the Colonel's son:--``Do good to bird and beast,
<DT>But count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast.
<DT>If there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away,
<DT>Belike the price of a jackal's meal were more than a thief could pay.
<DT>They will feed their horse on the standing crop, their men on the garnered grain,
<DT>The thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are slain.
<DT>But if thou thinkest the price be fair,--thy brethren wait to sup,
<DT>The hound is kin to the jackal-spawn,--howl, dog, and call them up!
<DT>And if thou thinkest the price be high, in steer and gear and stack,
<DT>Give me my father's mare again, and I'll fight my own way back!''
<DT>Kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet.
<DT>``No talk shall be of dogs,'' said he, ``when wolf and grey wolf meet.
<DT>May I eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath;
<DT>What dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with Death?''
<DT>Lightly answered the Colonel's son:  ``I hold by the blood of my clan:
<DT>Take up the mare for my father's gift,--by God, she has carried a man.!''
<DT>The red mare ran to the Colonel's son, and nuzzled against his breast,
<DT>``We be two strong men,'' said Kamal then, ``but she loveth the younger best.
<DT>So she shall go with a lifter's dower, my turquoise-studded  rein,
<DT>My broidered saddle and saddle-cloth, and silver stirrups twain.''
<P>
<DT>The Colonel's son a pistol drew and held it muzzle-end,
<DT>``Ye have taken the one from a foe,'' said he; ``will ye take the mate from a friend?''
<DT>``A gift for a gift,'' said Kamal straight, ``a limb for the risk of limb.
<DT>Thy father has sent his son to me, I'll send my son to him!''
<DT>With that he whistled his only son, that dropped from a mountain-crest--
<DT>He trod the ling like a buck in spring, and he looked like a lance at rest.
<DT>``Now here is thy master,'' Kamal said, ``who leads a troop of the Guides,
<DT>And thou must ride at his left side as shield on the shoulder rides.
<DT>Till Death or I cut loose the tie, at camp and board and bed,
<DT>Thy life is his--thy fate it is to guard him with thy head.
<DT>So thou must eat the White Queen's meat, and all her foes are thine,
<DT>And thou must harry thy father's hold for the peace of the Border-line,
<DT>And thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power--
<DT>Belike they will raise thee to Ressaldar when I am hanged in Peshawur.''
<P>
<DT>They have looked each other between the eyes, and there they found not fault,
<DT>They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on leavened bread and salt:
<DT>They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on fire and fresh-cut sod,
<DT>On the hilt and the haft of the Khyber knife, and the Wondrous Names of God.
<DT>The Colonel's son he rides the mare and Kamal's boy the dun,
<DT>And two have come back to Fort Bukloh where there went forth but one.
<DT>And when they drew to the Quarter-Guard, full twenty swords flew clear--
<DT>There was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer.
<DT>``Ha' done! ha' done!'' said the Colonel's son.  ``Put up the steel at your sides!
<DT>Last night ye had struck at a Border thief--to-night 'tis a man of the Guides!''
<P>
<DT><I>Oh, East is East and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,</I>
<DT><I>Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God's great Judgement Seat;</I>
<DT><I>But there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor Birth,</I>
<DT><I>When two strong men stand face to face, tho' they come from the ends of the earth!</I>

<H2><IMG SRC="marker2.gif"><I><A NAME="9"> <font color="#004080">McAndrew's Hymn</font></A></I></H2>
<UL><DL><P>
<DT><font size="+1">L</font>ORD, Thou hast made this world below the shadow of a dream,
<DT>An', taught by time, I tak' it so---exceptin' always Steam.
<DT>From coupler-flange to spindle-guide I see Thy Hand, O God---
<DT>Predestination in the stride o' yon connectin'-rod.
<DT>John Calvin might ha' forged the same---enorrmous, certain, slow---
<DT>Ay, wrought it in the furnace-flame---<I>my</I> ``Institutio.''
<DT>I cannot get my sleep to-night; old bones are hard to please;
<DT>I'll stand the middle watch up here---alone wi' God an' these
<DT>My engines, after ninety days o' rase an' rack an' strain
<DT>Through all the seas of all Thy world, slam-bangin' home again.
<DT>Slam-bang too much---they knock a wee---the crosshead-gibs are loose,
<DT>But thirty thousand mile o' sea has gied them fair excuse. ...
<DT>Fine, clear an'dark---a full-draught breeze, wi' Ushant out o' sight,
<DT>An' Ferguson relievin' Hay.  Old girl, ye'll walk to-night!
<DT>His wife's at Plymouth. ... Seventy---One---Two---Three since he began---
<DT>Three turns for Mistress Ferguson ...  and who's to blame the man?
<DT>There's none at any port for me, by drivin' fast or slow,
<DT>Since Elsie Campbell went to Thee, Lord, thirty years ago.
<DT>(The year the <I>Sarah Sands</I> was burned.  Oh roads we used to tread,
<DT>Fra' Maryhill to Pollokshaws--fra' Govan to Parkhead!)
<DT>Not but that they're ceevil on the Board.  Ye'll hear Sir Kenneth say:
<DT>``Good morn, McAndrew!  Back again?  An' how's your bilge to-day?''
<DT>Miscallin' technicalities but handin' me my chair
<DT>To drink Madeira wi' three Earls---the auld Fleet Engineer
<DT>That started as a boiler-whelp---when steam and he were low.
<DT><I>I</I> mind the time we used to serve a broken pipe wi' tow!
<DT>Ten pound was all the pressure then---Eh!  Eh!---a man wad drive;
<DT>An' here, our workin' gauges give one hunder sixty-five!
<DT>We're creepin' on wi' each new rig---less weight an' larger power;
<DT>There'll be the loco-boiler next an' thirty miles an hour!
<DT>Thirty an' more.  What I ha' seen since ocean-steam began
<DT>Leaves me na doot for the machine: but what about the man?
<DT>The man that counts, wi' all his runs, one million mile o' sea:
<DT>Four time the span from Earth to Moon. ... How far, O Lord from thee
<DT>That wast beside him night an' day?  Ye mind my first typhoon?
<DT>It scoughed the skipper on his way to jock wi' the saloon.
<DT>Three feet were on the stokehold-floor---just slappin' to an' fro---
<DT>An' cast me on a furnace-door.  I have the marks to show.
<DT>Marks! I ha' marks o' more than burns---deep in my soul an' black,
<DT>An' times like this, when things go smooth, my wickudness comes back.
<DT>The sins o' four an' forty years, all up an' down the seas.
<DT>Clack an' repeat like valves half-fed. ... Forgie's our trespasses!
<DT>Nights when I'd come on to deck to mark, wi' envy in my gaze,
<DT>The couples kittlin' in the dark between the funnel-stays;
<DT>Years when I raked the Ports wi' pride to fill my cup o' wrong---
<DT>Judge not, O Lord, my steps aside at Gay Street in Hong-Kong!
<DT>Blot out the wastrel hours of mine in sin when I abode---
<DT>Jane Harrigan's an' Number Nine, The Reddick an' Grant Road!
<DT>An' waur than all---my crownin' sin---rank blasphemy an' wild.
<DT>I was not four and twenty then---Ye wadna judge a child?
<DT>I'd seen the Tropics first that run---new fruit, new smells, new air---
<DT>How could I tell---blinf-fou wi' sun--- the Deil was lurkin' there?
<DT>By day like playhouse-scenes the shore slid past our sleepy eyes;
<DT>By night thos soft, lasceevious stars leered from those velvet skies,
<DT>In port (we used no cargo-steam) I'd daunder down the streets---
<DT>An ijjit grinnin' in a dream---for shells an' parrakeets,
<DT>An' walkin'-sticks o' carved bamboo an' blowfish stuffed an' dried---
<DT>Fillin' my bunk wi' rubbishry the Cheif put overside.
<DT>Till, off Sambawa Head, Ye mind, I heard a land-breeze ca',
<DT>Milk-warm wi' breath o' spice an' bloom: ``McAndrew, Come awa'!''
<DT>Firm, clear an' low---no haste, no hate---the ghostly whisper went,
<DT>Just statin' eevidential facts beyon' all argument:
<DT>``Your mither's god's a graspin' deil, the shadow o' yoursel',
<DT>``Got out o' books by meenisters clean daft on Heaven an' Hell.
<DT>``They mak' him in the Broomielaw, o' Glasgie cold an' dirt,
<DT>``A jealous, pridefu' fetich, lad, that's only strong to hurt.
<DT>``Ye'll not go back to Him again an' kiss His red-hot rod,
<DT>``But come wi' Us'' (Now who were <I>They?</I>) ``an' know the Leevin' God,
<DT>``That does not kipper souls for sport or break a life in jest,
<DT>``But swells the ripenin' cocoanuts an' ripes the woman's breast.''
<DT>An' there it stopped: cut off: no more; that quiet, certain voice---
<DT>For me, six months o' twenty-four, to leave or take at choice.
<DT>'Twas on me like a thunderclap---it racked me through an' through---
<DT>Temptation past the show o' speech, unnameable an' new---
<DT>The Sin against the Holy Ghost? ... An' under all, our screw.
<P>
<DT>That storm blew by but left behind her anchor-shiftin' swell.
<DT>thou knowest all my heart an' mind, Thou knowest, Lord, I fell---
<DT>Third on the <I>Mary Gloster</I> then, and first that night in Hell!
<DT>Yet was Thy Hand beneath my head, about my feet Thy Care---
<DT>Fra' Deli clear to Torres Strait, the trial o' despair,
<DT>But when we touched the Barrier Reef Thy answer to my prayer! ...
<DT>We wared na run that sea by night but lay an' held our fire,
<DT>An' I was drowsin' on the hatch---sick---sick wi' doubt an' tire:
<DT><I>``Better the sight of eyes that see than wanderin' o' desire!''</I>
<DT>Ye mind that word?  Clear as gongs---again, an' once again,
<DT>When rippin' down through coral-trash ran out our moorin'-chain:
<DT>An', by Thy Grace, I had the light to see my duty plain.
<DT>Light on the engine-room---no more---bright as our carbons burn.
<DT>I've lost it since a thousand times, but never past return!
<P>
<DT>Obsairve!  Per annum we'll have here two thousand souls aboard---
<DT>Think not I dare to justify myself before the Lord,
<DT>But---average fifteen hunder souls safe-born fra' port to port---
<DT>I <I>am</I> o' service to my kind.  Ye wadna blame the thought?
<DT>Maybe they steam from Grace to Wrath---to sin by folly led---
<DT>It isna mine to judge their path---their lives are on my head.
<DT>Mine at the last---when all is done it all comes back to me,
<DT>The fault that leaves six thousand ton a log upon the sea.
<DT>We'll tak' one stretch---three weeks an odd by ony road ye steer---
<DT>Fra' Cape Town east to Wellington---ye need an engineer.
<DT>Fail there---ye've time to weld your shaft---ay, eat it, ere ye're spoke;
<DT>Or make Kergueen under sail---three jiggers burned wi' smoke!
<DT>An' home again---the Rio run: it's no child's play to go
<DT>Steamin' to bell for fourteen days o' snow an' floe an' blow.
<DT>The beergs like kelpies oversde that girn an' turn an' shift
<DT>Whaur, grindin' like the Mills o' God, goes by the big South drift.
<DT>(Hail, Snow and Ice that praise the Lord.  I've met them at their work,
<DT>An wished we had anither route or they another kirk.)
<DT>Yon's strain, hard strain, o' head an' hand, for though Thy Power brings
<DT>All skill to naught, Ye'll underatand a man must think o' things.
<DT>Then, at the last, we'll get to port an' hoist their baggage clear---
<DT>The passengers, wi' gloves an' canes---an' this is what I'll hear:
<DT>``Well, thank ye for a pleasant voyage.  The tender's comin' now.''
<DT>While I go testin' follower-bolts an' watch the skipper bow.
<DT>They've words for every one but me---shake hands wi' half the crew,
<DT>Except the dour Scots engineer, the man they never knew.
<DT>An' yet I like the wark for all we've dam' few pickin's here---
<DT>No pension, an' the most we'll earn's four hunder pound a year.
<DT>Better myself abroad?  Maybe.  <I>I'd</I> sooner starve than sail
<DT>Wi' such as call a snifter-rod <I>ross</I>. ...  French for nightingale.
<DT>Commeesion on my stores?  Some do; but I cannot afford
<DT>To lie like stewards wi' patty-pans.  I'm older than the Board.
<DT>A bonus on the coal I save?  Ou ay, the Scots are close,
<DT>But when I grudge the strength Ye gave I'll grudge their food to <I>those</I>.
<DT>(There's bricks that I might recommend---an' clink the firebars cruel.
<DT>No!  Welsh---Wangarti at the worst---an' damn all patent fuel!)
<DT>Inventions?  Ye must stay in port to mak' a patent pay.
<DT>My Deeferential Valve-Gear taught me how that business lay.
<DT>I blame no chaps wi' clearer heads for aught they make or sell.
<DT><I>I</I> found that I could not invent an' look to these as well.
<DT>So, wrestled wi' Apollyon---Nah!---fretted like a bairn---
<DT>But burned the workin'-plans last run, wi' all I hoped to earn.
<DT>Ye know how hard an Idol dies, an' what that meant to me---
<DT>E'en tak' it for a sacrifice acceptable to Thee. ...
<DT><I>Below there!  Oiler!  What's your wark?  Ye find it runnin' hard?
<DT>Ye needn't swill the cup wi' oil---this isn't the Cunard!
<DT>Ye thought?  Ye are not paid to think.      Go, sweat that off again!</I>
<DT>Tck!  Tck!  It's deeficult to sweer nor tak' The Name in vain!
<DT>Men, ay an' women, call me stern.  Wi' these to oversee,
<DT>Ye'll note I've little time to burn on social repartee.
<DT>The bairns see what their elders miss; they'll hunt me to an' fro,
<DT>Till for the sake of---well, a kiss---I tak' 'em down below.
<DT>That minds me of our Viscount loon---Sir Kenneth's kin---the chap
<DT>Wi' Russia leather tennis-shoon an' spar-decked yachtin'-cap.
<DT>I showed him round last week, o'er all---an' at the last says he:
<DT>``Mister McAndrew, Don't you think steam spoils romance at sea?''
<DT>Damned ijjit!  I'd been doon that morn to see what ailed the throws,
<DT>Manholin', on my back---the cranks three inches off my nose.
<DT>Romance!  Those first-class passengers they like it very well,
<DT>Printed an' bound in little books; but why don't poets tell?
<DT>I'm sick of all their quirks an' turns---the loves an' doves they dream---
<DT>Lord, send a man like Robbie Burns to sing the Song o' Steam!
<DT>To match wi' Scotia's noblest speech yon orchestra sublime
<DT>Whaurto---uplifted like the Just---the tail-rods mark the time.
<DT>The crank-throws give the double-bass, the feed-pump sobs an' heaves,
<DT>An' now the main eccentrics start their quarrel on the sheaves:
<DT>Her time, her own appointed time, the rocking link-head bides,
<DT>Till---hear that note?---the rod's return whings glimmerin' through the guides.
<DT>They're all awa'!  True beat, full power, the clangin' chorus goes
<DT>Clear to the tunnel where they sit, my purrin' dynamos.
<DT>Interdependence absolute, forseen, ordained, decreed,
<DT>To work, Ye'll note, at ony tilt an' every rate o' speed.
<DT>Fra' Skylight-lift to furnace-bars, backed, bolted, braced an' stayed.
<DT>An' singin' like the Mornin' Stars for joy that they are made;
<DT>While, out o' touch o' vanity, the sweatin' thrust-block says:
<DT>``Not unto us the praise, or man---not unto us the praise!''
<DT>Now, a' together, hear them lift their lesson---theirs an' mine:
<DT>``Law, Orrder, Duty an' Restraint, Obedience, Discipline!''
<DT>Mill, forge an' try-pit taught them that when roarin' they arose,
<DT>An' whiles I wonder if a soul was gied them wi' the blows.
<DT>Oh for a man to weld it then, in one trip-hammer strain,
<DT>Till even first-class passengers could tell the meanin' plain!
<DT>But no one cares except mysel' that serve an' understand
<DT>My seven thousand horse-power here.  Eh Lord!  They're grand---they're grand!
<DT>Uplift am I?  When first in store the new-made beasties stood,
<DT>Were Ye cast down that breathed the Word declarin' all things good?
<DT>Not so!  O' that warld-liftin' joy no after-fall could vex,
<DT>Ye've left a glimmer still to cheer the Man---the Arrtifex!
<DT><I>That</I> holds, in spite o' knock and scale, o' friction, waste an' slip,
<DT>An' by that light---now, mark my word---we'll build the Perfect Ship.
<DT>I'll never last to judge her lines, or take her curve---not I.
<DT>But I ha' lived an' I ha' worked.  Be thanks to Thee, Most High!
<DT>An' I ha' done what I ha' done---judge Thou if ill or well---
<DT>Always Thy grace preventin' me. ...
<DD>      Losh!  Yon's the ``Stand-by'' bell.
<DT>Pilot so soon?  His flare it is.  The mornin'-watch is set.
<DT>Well, God be thanked, as I was sayin', I'm no Pelagian yet.
<DT>Now, I'll tak' on. ...
<DD>      <I>'Morrn, Ferguson.  Man, have ye ever thought
<DT>What your good leddy costs in coal? ... I'll burn 'em down to port.</I>
