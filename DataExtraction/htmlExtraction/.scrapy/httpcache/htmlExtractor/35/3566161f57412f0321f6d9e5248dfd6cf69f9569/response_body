												</header><h3>Top trends for 2018 
												- (According to Neilsen's latest 
												study)</h3>
												<p>Even though the Great 
												Recession officially ended in 
												mid-2009, 72 percent of global 
												respondents to a Nielsen online 
												survey say they feel like 
												they’re still in a recession—a 
												feeling that’s having a lasting 
												effect on their shopping 
												behaviors.When the global 
												economy was battered, it wasn’t 
												unexpected for people to cut 
												back on their shopping trips. 
												But as consumer confidence and 
												financial trends have improved, 
												consumers are still making fewer 
												shopping trips—a behavior that’s 
												a notable part of the new 
												normal. The silver lining in 
												this trend, however, is that 
												they’re spending more per trip.</p>
												<h3>THE NEW GLOBAL CONSUMER</h3>
												<p>While the decrease in 
												shopping trips may be perceived 
												negatively for retailers and 
												companies hoping to see more of 
												their customers, the trips 
												customers <i>are</i> making have 
												the potential to be more 
												lucrative. Decreasing trips 
												places greater importance on 
												each transaction, making 
												interaction with the consumer 
												much more critical.</p>
												<p>In Indonesia, for example, 
												households are spending 9 
												percent more per trip these days 
												than they were just a few years 
												ago. Over the study period, 
												consumers in Indonesia are 
												making 2 percent fewer trips, on 
												par with shopping trip trends in 
												Colombia and Chile. 
												Comparatively, trip frequency is 
												down 6 percent in South Korea, 3 
												percent in Canada and the U.S., 
												and 1 percent in France. 
												Spending per trip is up the most 
												in Indonesia, where households 
												are spending 11 percent more per 
												trip than the year-over-year 
												growth rate.</p>
												<p>The implications of the 
												global shift are clear: 
												consumers are looking to spend, 
												but retailers have fewer 
												opportunities to interact with 
												them. Consumers are planning, 
												demanding and above all, 
												connected. Retailers need to 
												capture consumers where they are 
												because they’re going to be 
												seeing them less often than they 
												have before.</p>
												<h3>Lifestyle and Technology are 
												Key Factors Driving the Shopping 
												Shift</h3>
												<p>Consumers are looking for 
												balance in their lives and 
												concern for work-life balance is 
												paramount; more than 80 percent 
												of global consumers cite 
												spending quality time with 
												friends and family is their top 
												value. Another key consideration 
												is rapidly advancing 
												technology—quickly evolving 
												devices that put consumers in 
												very close contact with an 
												ever-expanding realm of shopping 
												opportunity. Today, 49 percent 
												of online respondents make 
												purchases online—a figure that’s 
												only going to increase as mobile 
												technology continues to 
												proliferate. In 2012, for 
												example, there were more than 1 
												billion smart phones around the 
												world, a trend worth watching 
												wirth respect to mobile 
												purchasing.</p>
												<h3>Bringing the Store to the 
												Consumer</h3>
												<p>Today, it’s all about 
												bringing the store to the 
												consumer through various methods 
												pre, during and post purchase 
												cycle. Advertising, blogs, 
												social media and word-of-mouth 
												are critical tools in the ramp 
												up to selling a product or 
												service, while in-store 
												displays, coupons, sampling and 
												shelf talkers are great ways to 
												continue momentum once a product 
												or service is out in the market. 
												But it doesn’t end there. Social 
												media, customer relationship 
												management, text message 
												programs and on-pack coupons are 
												important ways to continue 
												engaging with consumers after 
												they’ve left the store.</p>
