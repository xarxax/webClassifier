        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="+3">E</font>ver
since David
Bottoms&acirc; first book, <i>Shooting Rats at the Bibb County Dump,</i>
was
selected by Robert Penn Warren for the Academy of American Poets&acirc;
Walt
Whitman Award in 1979, readers have come to expect certain traits or
patterns
of action in his poetry: a clear and credible voice offering accurate
and
evocative description of nature, as well as the natural activities of
everyday
existence, often mixed with wit and irony, as he searches for
understanding
of the higher spiritual significance among the commonplace or ordinary
events of life.&nbsp; With his retrospective <i>Armored Hearts:
Selected
and New Poems,</i> published in 1995, these signature features were
even
more readily apparent in an accumulation of outstanding lyric
narratives.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the
title
of his initial collection might indicate, during the earlier years of
his
poetry some of Bottoms&acirc; most characteristic works offered
narrators in
risky situations, outsiders and individuals barely on the ragged edge
of
society somehow engaged in activities that were rebellious or defiant,
perhaps even illegal and repellent.&nbsp; From those earliest poems and
through some others that followed in subsequent volumes, we have been
introduced
to characters stealing ornamental ironwork and vandalizing gravestones
in a cemetery at night ("Wrestling Angels"), getting high on pot in a
crypt
("Smoking in an Open Grave"), hot wiring a friend&acirc;s car in the
middle of
the night so it later could be rolled into a river to claim insurance
("In
the Black Camaro"), breaking into an old elementary school to cart off
a scarred desktop carved with names ("The Desk"), or raping a young
woman
in a hayloft ("The Farmers").</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many
poems have
presented portraits of the lost or lonely: "The Drunk Hunter" secretly
hopes "someone has heard his shot, / takes time to warn he&acirc;s
hunting posted
land"; "A Trucker Drives Through His Lost Youth," searches "again for
the
spirit / behind the eyes in his rear-view mirror"; "The Lame" boy
dreams
"he feels fish gnaw the swollen ankle, / carry off in their bellies
chunks
of his deformity."</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even
those poems
in which the description and circumstances of the narrator most clearly
suggest identification with Bottoms &divide; and in which the speaker
appears
to have undergone some sort of self-discovery, a moment of illumination
or imagination he may have been seeking &divide; an absence and a
separation from
others always seem emphasized.&nbsp; "In a Jon Boat During a Florida
Dawn,"
Bottoms writes, "you feel an old surprise surfacing / in and around
you.&nbsp;
If you could, / you would cut the outboard / and stop it all right
here&middot;."&nbsp;
"In a Pasture Under a Cradled Moon," the speaker concludes by "studying
the way the light drops into the trees, / the way so much love can be
learned
/ from loss." "In a U-Haul North of Damascus," the narrator finds
himself
"on the road from one state / to another, what is left behind nags
through
the distance."&nbsp; In "Paper Route, Northwest Montana," Bottoms
recalls
an early glimpse of "a stunned white wolf" drifting down the river on
an
ice floe, and he concludes, "sometimes in loneliness, I claim it / a
blessing&middot;."&nbsp;
And alone on another river "Under the Vulture Tree," he imagines the
black
birds filling a dead oak as "transfiguring angels," figures "who pray
over
the leaf-graves of the anonymous lost&middot;."</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
scenes depicted
in Bottoms&acirc; poems have always carried a strong sense of
authenticity and
credibility as they carefully catalog even the most ordinary items in
everyday
life, yet present them in a lyrical language that lends an elegance to
everything that matters, especially those objects too often overlooked
because of their commonplace appearances, but that are nevertheless
essential.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Appropriately,
in "Appearances" Bottoms recounts once listening to a radio
reporter&acirc;s
narration of sheriff&acirc;s deputies searching a hay field in a curve
of headlights:
"I curl under my blanket, / watch the yellow dial on the radio, the
stars
hanging / in the black panes of the window.&nbsp; This is
real&middot;."&nbsp;&nbsp;
Indeed, the more "real" the images and events chronicled in
Bottoms&acirc; poems,
the more he seems obligated to choose musical phrases with convincing
metaphors
or similes that persuade the reader of their significance, and the
richer
the reader is for it.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bottoms&acirc; ability
to transform the ordinary into the extraordinary can be seen in one
wonderful
work after another among the pages of these selected poems.&nbsp;
"Under
the Boathouse" is a remarkable example.&nbsp; In this lyric narrative
effectively
written in one extended stanza of nearly fifty lines, Bottoms&acirc;
narrator
describes how he and his wife had arrived at a lake for a picnic, his
"wife
/ rattling keys, calling for help with the grill, / the groceries
wedged
into the trunk."&nbsp; Instead of assisting her, he ran to dive into
the
lake, but as he "cut through water" into the "junked depth," his "right
hand dug into silt and mud" and his "left clawed around a pain."&nbsp;
"Caught by the unknown," his "lungs collapsed in a confusion of
bubbles,
/ all air rising back to its element."&nbsp; He describes it:&nbsp;
"Halfway
between the bottom of the lake / and the bottom of the sky, I hung like
a buoy / on a short rope, an effigy&middot;."</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suspended
in
water between the mud beneath him and the sky brightening the surface
above
him, he finds himself out of his element, "a curiosity among fishes, a
bait hanging up / instead of down."&nbsp; His world has literally been
turned upside down.</font><img src="armoredhearts.jpeg" hspace="5"
 vspace="5" border="0" height="182" width="120" align="right"> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the lung-ache,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the loud pulsing of temples, what gave first</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
was something in my head, a burst</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of colors like the blind see, and I saw</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
against the surface, a shadow like an angel</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
quivering in a dead-man&acirc;s float,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
then a shower of plastic knives and forks</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
spilling past me in the lightened water, a can</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of barbequed beans, a bottle of A.1, napkins</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
drifting down like white leaves,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
heavenly litter from the world I struggled toward.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like
Frost&acirc;s swinger
of birches who climbs black branches toward heaven and then comes back
"to begin over," Bottoms&acirc; narrator also comes back with a renewed
vision
to begin again.&nbsp; In the final act of this metaphoric baptism and
rebirth,
death and resurrection, there is a welcoming by "a shadow like an
angel"
and a shower of "heavenly litter." The narrator describes the moment
when
he discovered himself returning to the elements of his world:</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Into the splintered light under the boathouse,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the loved, suffocating air hovering over the lake,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the cry of my wife leaning dangerously</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
over the dock, empty grocery bags at her feet,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I bobbed with a hook through the palm of my hand.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rising
into the
light and once more able to see the world, now "like the blind see,"
with
its "suffocating air" he had hurried to escape, the narrator is greeted
back by the wife whose plea for assistance he&acirc;d ignored &divide;
even risking
falling herself as she leans over the lake toward him to offer help,
her
silhouette against the bright sky above taking the shape of an angel on
the water&acirc;s surface &divide; and those groceries, the everyday
items that suddenly
matter so much more, have become "heavenly litter from the world" to
which
he is struggling to return, although he will carry a scar in his palm
as
a
souvenir of the experience, as well as a constant reminder of what he
ought
to value.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use
of religious
symbolism &divide; images of angels, heaven, and even the wound in the
palm of
the narrator&acirc;s hand &divide; and references to spiritual
redemption or renewal
are not isolated to "Under the Boathouse" and "Wrestling Angels."&nbsp;
In another example, "Cemetery Wings," a worker allergic to bee stings
is
attacked by a swarm while mowing grass among monuments in a
cemetery.&nbsp;
As the worker is digging "into his pocket for the bottle" of "blue
pills
for allergy,"&nbsp; the poem&acirc;s narrator arrives as a witness
wishing to
assist:</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If he knew me.&nbsp; I couldn&acirc;t tell.&nbsp; He only stared</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
over the terrace at the thin cloud lifting</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
around the faces of angels, his eyes</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
wrinkled toward a question,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
as though puzzled</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
at being carried away by such small wings.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like
those other
Southern poets &divide; James Dickey, Robert Penn Warren, Dave Smith,
and Charles
Wright &divide; most obviously influential in his poetry, Bottoms often
uses such
religious allusions.&nbsp; In fact, Bottoms' emphasis on the spiritual
and his reliance on religious allusions have only grown over the
years.&nbsp;
Indeed, the allusion to Christ&acirc;s stigmata in "Under the
Boathouse" appears
more completely in "Last Supper in Montana," an important poem among
the
new works at the end of the <i>Armored Hearts</i> section, in which
the
speaker&acirc;s "father-in-law begins the feast / by reading a few
verses from
the Gospel of Matthew."&nbsp; He then "breaks the body into thumbnails
/ and passes the plate among us, pours the blood / into plastic
cups."&nbsp;
Using similar images, but in contrast with the tone of "Under the
Boathouse,"
Bottoms writes:</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I swallow, and glance at my palm, the tangle of veins</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in my wrist.&nbsp; A minute drips into an empty pan,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
then a guinea screeches from the barn.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Prayer breaks out on the sofa,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and finally I see how a wound could bleed</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
for centuries, could trickle enough</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to fill this cup.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Years ago, after my divorce,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I looked for my own way of renouncing</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the world.&nbsp; I sat down in my kitchen and scratched</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a list on a grocery bag,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
every desire linked</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in red, then carried a shovel into a grove,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
wadded the bag and buried it.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But that was Florida, smothering heat,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bouts of booze and fever,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
so what can I say for sure about surrender</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
or that lightness of heart?</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
narrator recounts
another metaphoric death at the conclusion of the poem as he reports
"something
/ left me, and the wind knocked me down," and he lies sprawled on his
back
"across that grave."&nbsp; Indeed, it is as if Bottoms&acirc; poetry
near the
end of this collection reflects a transformation and signals a renewal
of spirit, a death followed by a rebirth of the self.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This can
easily
be seen in a contrast of two poems with similar titles: "A Home Buyer
Watches
the Moon," which was printed early among the poems of&nbsp; <i>In a
U-Haul
North of Damascus</i> in 1983, and "A Home Buyer," which appears near
the
end of <i>Armored Hearts</i> in 1995.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early poem
the
narrator reflects upon the feeling of total loss (perhaps even of life
itself as suggested by the line break after "live" and the image of a
"dead
end") symbolized by an inability to keep his house: "I / who can no
longer
afford to live / in my two-story, have come out into the street / to
stare
past the mailboxes at an abrupt dead end."&nbsp; The poem concludes
with
another series of superb images, typical of Bottoms&acirc; lyrical and
evocative
poetry, that again speak of an angel and bring to mind the scene
depicted
in "Cemetery Wings":</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Quietly now the bats jerk</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in and out of the streetlight, their shadows</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
zipping across the grass like black snakes.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And the moon lies balanced on the roof of my house</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
like a new gold coin, or the simple face</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of an angel in a Colonial cemetery.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
lone figure
wandering at night dejectedly observing ominous images and the
speaker&acirc;s
use of similes suggesting loss or death in this early '80s poem already
are familiar to readers of Bottoms&acirc; poetry.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;
a dozen
years and three collections of poetry later, Bottoms now offers a
different
view.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bottoms
begins
"A Home Buyer" with a couple lines of happiness and renewal: "I was so
glad to be living in my own house again, / glad for a few rooms to
wander
through, a place to sprawl."&nbsp; And although this poem also begins
with
the figure of the speaker wandering at night ("I walked all night from
room to room, / onto the deck, into the yard, exploring / my pond of
ivy,
shadows of maple and dogwood."), the mood has been reversed.&nbsp; The
narrator now feels content: "settled, finally, in the striped chair of
the study / as a blue daybreak leaked like bar light / through the
curtains."&nbsp;
The onset of a new day&acirc;s brightness causes him to recall another
time of
"happiness, confidence, like a saint" &divide; or perhaps, like the
kind of persona
who often was seen in Bottoms&acirc; previous poems:</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&middot;some cowboy off the ranch in Rygate</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
who&acirc;s driven into town for a Legion Hall dance,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
some slicked-up kid with scuffs on his boots,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
smart enough and handsome, a hard worker,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
who believes in virtue,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and knows the value of a dependable truck.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
pairing of
"virtue" and "value" seems significant in these closing lines, as does
the speaker&acirc;s feeling of being content with becoming "settled,"
which could
be applied in its many definitions: settling into the new house;
settling
down to an end of restlessness; settling up a debt; as legally defined,
settling his property; perhaps even as a consequence of learning
compromise,
settling for what he needs.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Certainly, the
following poem in the collection, "Sleepless Nights," at first suggests
a return to the dejected wanderings as the narrator tells of visiting
his
old house at night while the woman he left "was out of town, or drunk
herself
/ in a fast sleep."&nbsp; However, he reveals: "In middle age you
strike
your bargain with shame, / and I leaned back against that tree, happy /
and hurt to be trespassing."</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
poem&acirc;s conclusion
presents proof of the narrator&acirc;s transformation toward greater
wisdom and
new concerns, voiced not only in this poem, but seemingly emerging in
the
development of Bottoms&acirc; poetry at the very end of <i>Armored
Hearts</i>
and soon to be realized further in future work.&nbsp; He confesses:</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&middot;I&acirc;d look back at myself</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
out of another night, pacing another darkness</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ringed with geese and black sheep</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and swans, singing again,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
laughing, shouldering the complaints</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of a newborn daughter.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bottoms' relationship
with his daughter Rachel, named in the poetry, and his focus on
comforting
and protecting her become central themes in his work.&nbsp; In "A
Daughter's
Fever" Bottoms addresses Rachel, but his comments reflect a new vision
and a new attitude toward the world and his position in it.&nbsp; After
reading books aloud and trying other distractions to ease his
daughter's
discomfort during an illness, Bottoms states:</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rachel, about the little girl</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
who started home late</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
across the darkening woods...</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Someday I'll give you the words I used all night</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to guide her home.&nbsp; So many ways</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to enter the forest and never return.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But happily that's another ending.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Perhaps a darker
ending would have been the kind of conclusion readers would have seen
in
Bottoms' earlier poems.&nbsp; Instead, in this poem, Bottoms states, "I
lean to your blanket / and hold my breath."&nbsp; After all the
previous
images of death and loss in Bottoms' poetry, of the self seeking
independence,
his life &divide; indeed, his every breath &divide; has now become
dependent upon the
safety and well-being of another, his daughter.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although
the
closing stanza of the poem switches to third person, creating an
ambiguity
of memory and distance, almost as if the narrator has now become a
character
in one of those tales told to the daughter, he concludes with an image
that contrasts with the darkness of the poem's opening stanza which
begins
with the following lines: "Dark ivy draws a wave across the yard, /
even
the shadows / are streaked with rain."</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this
wonderful
ending, once more his breath is dependent upon his daughter's, and even
with a small curled finger, her hold on him continues:</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her father watches</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
new light clothe the trees.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In his orchard</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the crows out-cackle the squirrels.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He holds his breath to hear</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
her breathe, around his finger</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
small fingers curl.</font> <br>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="+3">P</font>ublished
in
1999, two decades after his first collection was selected for
recognition
by Robert Penn Warren, <i>Vagrant Grace</i> is David Bottoms&acirc;
fifth book
of poems and the first to follow publication of <i>Armored Hearts:
Selected
and New Poems.</i>&nbsp; Although many of the characteristics
identified
with Bottoms' fine poetry over the past twenty years still remain, this
new collection possesses an identity of its own.&nbsp; In fact, coming
after the 1995 retrospective volume of selected poetry, <i>Vagrant
Grace</i>
appropriately displays many poems that represent a new movement forward
in content and in tone toward a direction first suggested by those
closing
poems of <i>Armored Hearts.</i></font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vagrant Grace</i>
is organized symmetrically in five sections.&nbsp; The first and last
sections
contain a trio of three-part poems each.&nbsp; Sections two and four
have
ten poems, each a short lyrical work and none separated into
parts.&nbsp;
The third section, literally the centerpiece, is one poem, "Country
Store
and Moment of Grace," nearly twenty pages long and broken into
unnumbered
parts separated by horizontal lines.&nbsp; This center section also
uses
the "drop line" popularized by Charles Wright, and clearly resembles in
style and content some of the longer poems found in Wright's recent
collections.&nbsp;
Therefore, it is not surprising to note that one of the epigraphs at
the
beginning of <i>Vagrant Grace</i> is from a poem by Charles Wright:
"All
things aspire to weightlessness, / some place beyond the lip of
language,
/ Some silence, some zone of grace...."</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All three
poems
in the opening section continue the emphasis on father-daughter
relationship
that emerged in the closing poems of <i>Armored Hearts.</i>&nbsp; In
fact,
the first poem of the collection, "Bronchitis," carries similarities
with
"A Daughter's Fever."&nbsp; Once again, the narrator's concern is for
the
safety and well-being of the young girl who "breathes the little noise
of wheels / on dry axles."&nbsp; As he sits nearby and reads a book
about
the Civil War, he acknowledges his worries: "all the loose
uncertainties
of fatherhood grate / in the joints of my chair."&nbsp; He is absorbed
by the story of another young child, a three-year-old girl killed with
her dog by shell fire during one of the Civil War battles, though
mentioned
"only as a footnote in the abstract / strategies of war."&nbsp; He
imagines
the situation, "shell crater and spaniel, / powder stench, geyser of
dust
settling / as her mother staggers."&nbsp; He reveals the one
vulnerability
he cannot avoid, and which now appears again and again in Bottoms'
poetry,
a fear of any danger to his daughter.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost as
if
Bottoms has intentionally taken his poetry full circle since his first
poems twenty years ago, the second poem in <i>Vagrant Grace,</i> "On
Methodist
Hill," displays a viewpoint in direct opposition to "Wrestling Angels,"
the opening poem in <i>Armored Hearts: Selected and New Poems.</i>&nbsp;
On this occasion, father and daughter visit a boarded-up church and a
cemetery
that have been vandalized and allowed to fall into ruin:</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shab of a plundred tomb, crust and leaf-stain,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
litter of wet newspaper, sandwich wrapper, pizza box, stench</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of sardine and wine&divide;</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the wind it hisses slightly,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
or sighs like a choir before the first note sung,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
then nothing much as I walk my daughter up the marble steps.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
tone of regret
in this new poem should be heard in contrast with the defiant voice at
the end of "Wrestling Angels," where the speaker and his friends have
vandalized
a cemetery and he comments on further damaging monuments during their
departure:
"We break their arms and leave them wingless, / leaning over graves
like
old men lamenting their age."&nbsp; By the closing of "On Methodist
Hill,"
the scene has become one evoking sorrow from the narrator rather than
defiance,
"this church / hollowed and crumbling on a hill of weeds / where a
four-year-old
climbs a vandalized angel / as her father begins, unaccountably, to
weep."</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final
poem
in the opening section, "A Family Parade," completes a trio of
triptychs
involving the father and daughter.&nbsp; Filled with detailed
description
of townfolks and objects one might find in any small community's parade
"somewhere up Main Street," and rendered in the clear and lyrical
language
now expected from his poems, Bottoms' lines invite the reader to ride
along
with him, his wife, and daughter Rachel as they weave on their bicycles
through people along the parade route.&nbsp;</font><img

        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A rolling quack</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sousa-blasting boom box bungeed</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I circle them down the streets of the suburb...</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bottoms repeats
the action of "circling" a number of times in the poem, obviously
suggesting
the circular patterns of nature's seasons in his description of the
weather
or flowering trees, the repeated rituals like this holiday parade, the
renewal as evidenced by "the antebellum library waiting / to be reborn
in brick and glass," and the circular pattern of life itself.&nbsp; As
he watches the motorcycle corps, he thinks back to a memory of his
father:</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Finally, yes, I know this is about eternity,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
this circling, this following,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and, of course, that irredeemable taunt of memory,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
without which we'd have no ghosts to lead us...</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the way my father leads his pack into the Snake Slither,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Rolling Circle, the figure 8.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Remembering his
father reminds Bottoms of another circlular pattern &divide; of family,
of his
own role now as father, as he turns "to catch Rachel's eyes."</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Throughout the
book, other poems return to the father-daughter relationship, the
carefully
crafted lines of poetry as much lines full of caring poetically
crafted.&nbsp;
The fear of harm coming to the daughter arises again in "My Daughter at
the Gymnastics Party," where Bottoms watches Rachel perform in "a
lower-school
gym" by climbing a rope "until she'd cleared the lower rafters."&nbsp;
This time, she is the one "glancing toward the bleachers to see" if he
is watching.&nbsp; However, Bottoms is unable to observe without fear,
without thinking of other scenes:</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
...that boy</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
with the waffled skull, stiff and turning blue</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
under the belly of a horse,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
or the Christmas Eve skater on Cagle's Lake,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
her face a black plum</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
against the bottom of the ice.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another moving
poem, "Night Strategies," demonstrates the father's fear for his
daughter's
safety. While bathing his young child, the narrator is unable to escape
a radio report, even more disturbing than that in "Appearances," he'd
recently
heard about warfare in Europe.&nbsp; Much like the girl killed by the
shell
fire of a Civil War skirmish who haunts the father in "Bronchitis," the
father in "Night Strategies" is haunted by the image of another girl
caught
in the midst of battle.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I kept brushing the cloth over the pouch of her stomach,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the cherubic and slightly chafed</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
folds of her hips,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
remembering the voice rising off my radio,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a girl in Sarajevo, sixteen,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
quivering between a translator and the thuds</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of local shelling.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
girl had been
attacked by soldiers.&nbsp; She describes a rape that resembles a scene
in Bottoms' early poem, "The Farmers." However, if one compares the two
poems, the second-person narration and the distance created by the tone
of the poem in "The Farmers" has now been replaced &divide; even though
the rape
in this new poem is reported secondhand through memory of an account
from
a radio &divide; by the intimacy of a first-person narrator, the
father, "clumsy
/ and apologetic," shaken by such a tale of violence to someone else's
daughter:</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
They left her naked on a bloody cot.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
She wept, she said, but not inconsolably</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
like her mother, who clawed all night at the tiles</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of their mosque.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
father realizes
he is powerless in any desire to protect his child for her whole life
from
such a vicious world as this.&nbsp; (As he says in "A Walk to Carter's
Lake": "Small wonder the angels are said to despise us.")&nbsp; He is
at
a loss to explain such actions to her &divide; perhaps, to himself as
well.&nbsp;
For the moment, he can only continue to bathe his young daughter:</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I lathered the cloth with our wafer of soap</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
knowing the only answer I have</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is this nervous</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
exaggeration of tenderness.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
centerpiece
poem of <i>Vagrant Grace,</i> "Country Store and Moment of Grace,"
offers
a welcome opportunity for Bottoms to be expansive, even more than in
the
terrific triptych poems from <i>In a U-Haul North of Damascus</i> and
again
present in this new collection.&nbsp; Like Charles Wright, whose longer
poems in the collections since <i>The Southern Cross</i> this one
resembles,
Bottoms' ability over the years to compress so much descriptive detail
and dramatic tension into shorter lyrical poems has been admirable;
however,
as in those lengthier poems by Wright, the longer form used for
"Country
Store and Moment of Grace" appears to allow greater complexity and more
gradual development.&nbsp; Indeed, the South of Bottoms' childhood is
precisely
drawn in the numerous scenes that follow one another in this
nineteen-page
poem that turns on the actions in his grandfather's store:</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pot gut stove and wood sizzle,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and the raw smell of bologna and cheese, rack</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of Slim Jim and jerky, Tom's snacks,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
peppermint, drift of kerosene from a paint can,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and from where he sits,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
glassed sweetness</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of stacked tobacco, Chesterfield and King Edward,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Beechnut, Red Man, Bull of the Woods.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
men who congregate
in the store, those men "brooding or tongue-tied / worn-out in their
walked-down
boots and overalls shabby / with clay," are depicted with equal
precision.&nbsp;
With the luxury of expansion, the narration drifts across years, even
generations,
and back again, as Bottoms watches his daughter gather leaves for
burning:
"Rachel rakes a few into a pile the wind disperses, / and again I'm
drawing
parallels / to the memory...."&nbsp; It seems as if Bottoms is once
more
brought back by that "taunt of memory" that gives us "ghosts to lead
us."&nbsp;
However, there is a larger issue behind all the pleasant memories he
recalls
and the lessons of love or the meaning of grief they offer, and a
darkness
lies just outside the door of his family's house despite the
appearances
of security or comfort at home:</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
...ours is the scrawny house of green shingles, rusted screens</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
on the side porch,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
rock arch around the door.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Television in the living room, Arthur Godfrey</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
or Ed Sullivan, and a juggler spins plates on tall sticks</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
as my father and I watch from the couch...</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sweet smell of corn</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and barbequed chicken,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
which means it's Sunday...</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Horns blare from the highway, south from the Trading Post,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
loud and louder,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
then right outside our door</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a legion of noise.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
larger issue
is displayed throughout the poem in images of racism and possible
violence,
some as subtle as the "black noose of fuchsia / dangling" from a
bedroom
planter or the more threatening symbol of the noose "looped around the
rearview" and "hanging like a pair of dice"; other indications are as
overt
as the racist statements by the country store regulars or "the two cars
burned / on the curb in front of the Canton Theater."&nbsp; A parallel
is developed between the grief his grandmother felt when Bottoms'
father
was reported missing ("Whenever I think I know about grief, / I imagine
an only son lost / in the Pacific"), presumed dead for fifteen months,
and the loss felt by a black mother who prepares holiday decorations as
she waits for her son late from school because he is off cutting a tree
for Christmas; instead, she sees:</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the road behind her house</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the dull yellow star on the door of a Chevy</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and feels down her nerves</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the ice</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of her whole head frosting white, a shiver</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
against terrible weather.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
whole theme
of racism, threats of violence, and resistance to integration lead to a
single incident of great significance witnessed by Bottoms, though not
part of "the noise of headline and newscast," but "the real thing" as
it
"plays out quietly somewhere else."&nbsp; It is December of 1960.&nbsp;
A black woman enters the country store amid the threatening expressions
of all the regulars, and the grandfather gets up out of his chair:</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
not gauging their faces,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
not glancing at me watching, stunned, from the feed room</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
as the woman fingered coins</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and lifted from the drink box of Coca-Cola,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
so that suddenly at the scripted moment</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the script fell away,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
his hand simply opening,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
his head nodding slowly</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
as she dropped the two nickels and faded</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the drizzle, in the shiver and groan of muffler,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the crunch of tires on gravel.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That
simple act
by his grandfather signals an end as well as a beginning.&nbsp; Bottoms
doesn't decide whether the act was "failure of nerve / or heart, or
among
those hardening glares, that victory / of nerve or heart," and it does
not seem to matter.&nbsp; What matters is the "passing into memory /
and
Amen to its passing again out of memory."&nbsp; That old South he once
knew has been replaced, even the grocery store torn down to make room
for
a K-Mart.&nbsp; Bottoms says "Amen to leaving behind of places / that
might
have been less lovely and often are," so that they merely exist in a
"fractured
afterlife of memory."</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bottoms
considers
the nature of memory and its vagaries throughout <i>Vagrant Grace,</i>
suggesting "there's always uncertain light in a memory like this" ("A
Room
on Washington Avenue"), and "in middle age the memory circles" ("My
Uncle
Sowing Beatitudes").&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, Bottoms acknowledges these
are
poems of middle age in "A Morning from the Gospel of John":</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This morning in my bathroom mirror, I glimpsed the slope</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of my shoulders, my chest thinning to a hint of ribs,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the hair of my pouching belly</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
black and beaded with water,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and pondering myself limp and priestly,</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
laced with blue veins, I judged nothing threatening.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
poems of <i>Vagrant
Grace</i> are written with the achieved wisdom and maturity of middle
age.&nbsp;
Readers who have enjoyed Bottoms' shorter lyrical works in the four
previous
collections will not be disappointed by the twenty poems in the two
sections
of this collection still filling that description.&nbsp; Moreover, the
two sections containing a half dozen triptychs and the centerpiece
section
of "Country Store and Moment of Grace" present a diversity of options
for
Bottoms to explore more complex issues or situations and his emotional
responses to them with greater depth.&nbsp; In many ways, over the past
two decades Bottoms' poetry has turned full circle; however, like the
Rolling
Circle pattern his father maneuvers on a motorcycle in Bottoms' memory,
with the circular motion there has been a correlative movement forward.</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a poem
"At
the Grave of Martha Ellis," where a statue of the twelve-year-old (made
famous in the song "Little Martha" by Duane Allman) looks down over her
grave, Botttoms decides "in middle age rebirth isn't such easy
work."&nbsp;
However, as mentioned earlier, rebirth and renewal appear to be primary
themes in Bottoms' recent poetry, and although it may not be such easy
work, these new works of poetry created by Bottoms exhibit a renewal of
spirit and are easily among his best.</font> <br>
