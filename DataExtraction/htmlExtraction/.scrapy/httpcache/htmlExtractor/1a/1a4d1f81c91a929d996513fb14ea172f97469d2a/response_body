<h1>Carnatic Music - Recordings &amp; Discussion</h1>

<p>Carnatic music is the classical music of Southern India.  The
basic form is a monophonic song with improvised variations.  There
are 72 basic scales on the octave, and a rich variety of melodic
motion.  Both melodic and rhythmic structures are varied and
compelling.  This is one of the world's oldest &amp; richest musical
traditions.</p>

especially worthwhile.</li>

<h3>Recording lists:</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="carnatic/cbl.html">Beginner's List</a> - written as
part of the FAQ</li>
<li><a href="carnatic/cblsup.html">Carnatic Recording List</a> -
a longer list of my favorite CDs (with contents &amp; discussion)</li>
</ul>

<p>The recording lists are based on a fairly large amount of personal
experience, both of recorded music and live concerts.  In this
case, they are authoritative, in the sense that they do what they
set out to do.  Alternative sources have not really been available,
although others will certainly have their own opinions to add.</p>

<h3>Composition lists:</h3>

</ul>

<p>Although much effort has been put into the composition lists,
they cannot be considered authoritative.  Information on the subject
can be difficult to obtain, or contradictory.  There are controversies
on some subjects, and difficulties of classification.  Corrections
are certainly appreciated, and the individual files should give
some indication of to what degree the information can be trusted.</p>

<p>I do not intend any sort of comprehensive link index.  These
are just some sites I find personally useful.  There are many more
Carnatic music sites now than there were in 1994 when this page
appeared.  I simply do not have the spare time to make a more
thorough link listing, and must concentrate instead on the content
available at this site.</p>

<p>I will do my best to keep these documents up to date.</p>
