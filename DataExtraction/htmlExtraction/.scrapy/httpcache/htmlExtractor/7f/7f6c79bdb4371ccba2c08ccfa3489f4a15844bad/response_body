<DT>How lofty, sweet Afton, thy neighboring hills,
<DT>Far marked with the courses of clear winding rills;
<DT>There daily I wander as noon rises high,
<DT>My flocks and my Mary's sweet cot in my eye.
<p>
<DT>How pleasant thy banks and green valleys below,
<DT>Where wild in the woodlands the primroses blow;
<DT>There oft as mild evening weeps over the lea,
<DT>The sweet-scented birk shades my Mary and me.
<p>
<DT>Thy crystal stream, Afton, how lovely it glides,
<DT>And winds by the cot where my Mary resides;
<DT>How wanton the waters her snowy feet lave,
<DT>As gathering sweet flowerets she stems thy clear wave.
<p>
<DT>Flow gently, sweet Afton, among thy Green braes,
<DT>Flow gently, sweet river, the theme of my lays;

<UL><DL><P>
<dt><font size="+1">T</font>HE gloomy night is gath'ring fast,
<dt>Loud roars the wild inconstant blast;
<dt>Yon murky cloud is filled with rain,
<dt>I see it driving o'er the plain;
<dt>The hunter now has left the moor,
<dt>The scatt'red coveys meet secure;
<dt>While here I wander, prest with care,
<dt>Along the lonely banks of Ayr.
<p>
<dt>The Autumn mourns her rip'ning corn
<dt>By early Winter's ravage torn;
<dt>Across her placid, azure sky,
<dt>She sees the scowling tempest fly;
<dt>Chill runs my blood to hear it rave:
<dt>I think upon the stormy wave,
<dt>Where many a danger I must dare,
<dt>Far from the bonie banks of Ayr.
<p>
<dt>'Tis not the surging billows' roar,
<dt>'Tis not the fatal, deadly shore;
<dt>Tho' death inev'ry shape appear,
<dt>The wretched have no more to fear:
<dt>But round my heart the ties are bound,
<dt>That heart transpierc'd with many a wound;
<dt>These bleed afresh, those ties I tear,
<dt>To leave the bonie banks of Ayr.
<p>
<dt>Farewell, old Coila's hills and dales,
<dt>Her heathy moors and winding vales;
<dt>The scenes where wretched Fancy roves,
<dt>Pursuing past, unhappy loves!
<dt>Farewell my friends! Farewell my foes!
<dt>My peace with these, my love with those--
<dt>The bursting tears my heart declare,
<dt>Farewell, my bonie banks of Ayr.

<UL><DL><P>
<dt><font size="+1">T</font>here was three kings into the east,
<dd>  Three kings both great and high,
<dt>And they hae sworn a solemn oath
<dd>  John Barleycorn should die.
<p>
<dt>They took a plough and plough'd him down,
<dd>  Put clods upon his head,
<dt>And they hae sworn a solemn oath
<dd>  John Barleycorn was dead.
<p>
<dt>But the cheerful Spring came kindly on,
<dd>  And show'rs began to fall;
<dt>John Barleycorn got up again,
<dd>  And sore surpris'd them all.
<p>
<dt>The sultry suns of Summer came,
<dd>  And he grew thick and strong;
<dt>His head weel arm'd wi' pointed spears,
<dd>  That no one should him wrong.
<p>
<dt>The sober Autumn enter'd mild,
<dd>  When he grew wan and pale;
<dt>His bending joints and drooping head
<dd>  Show'd he began to fail.
<p>
<dt>His colour sicken'd more and more,
<dd>  He faded into age;
<dt>And then his enemies began
<dd>  To show their deadly rage.
<p>
<dt>They've taen a weapon, long and sharp,
<dd>  And cut him by the knee;
<dt>Then tied him fast upon a cart,
<dd>  Like a rogue for forgerie.
<p>
<dt>They laid him down upon his back,
<dd>  And cudgell'd him full sore;
<dt>They hung him up before the storm,
<dd>  And turn'd him o'er and o'er.
<p>
<dt>They laid him out upon the floor,
<dd>  To work him further woe;
<dt>And still, as signs of life appear'd,
<dd>  They toss'd him to and fro.
<p>
<dt>They wasted, o'er a scorching flame,
<dd>  The marrow of his bones;
<dt>But a miller us'd him worst of all,
<dd>  For he crush'd him between two stones.
<p>
<dt>And they hae taen his very heart's blood,
<dd>  And drank it round and round;
<dt>And still the more and more they drank,
<dd>  Their joy did more abound.
<p>
<dt>John Barleycorn was a hero bold,
<dd>  Of noble enterprise;
<dt>For if you do but taste his blood,
<dd>  'Twill make your courage rise.
<p>
<dt>'Twill make a man forget his woe;
<dd>  'Twill heighten all his joy;
<dt>'Twill make the widow's heart to sing,
<dd>  Tho' the tear were in her eye.
<p>
<dt>Then let us toast John Barleycorn,
<dd>  Each man a glass in hand;
<dt>And may his great posterity
<dd>  Ne'er fail in old Scotland!

<dt><font size="+1">O</font> YE wha are sae guid yoursel',

<p>
<dt>Hear me, ye venerable core,
<dd>  As counsel for poor mortals
<dt>That frequent pass douce Wisdom's door
<dd>  For glaikit Folly's portals:
<dt>I, for their thoughtless, careless sakes,

<dt>Their donsie tricks, their black mistakes,
<dd>  Their failings and mischances.
<p>
<dt>Ye see your state wi' theirs compared,

<dt>Wi' wind and tide fair i' your tail,
<dd>  Right on ye scud your sea-way;

<p>
<dt>Ye high, exalted, virtuous dames,

<dt>Then gently scan your brother man,

<dt>Tho' they may gang a kennin wrang,
<dd>  To step aside is human;

<dd>  The moving <i>Why </i> they do it;
<dt>And just as lamely can ye mark,
<dd>  How far perhaps they rue it.
<p>
<dt>Who made the heart, 'tis He alone

<dt>He knows each chord, its various tone,
<dd>  Each spring, its various bias:

<dd>But house or hald.
<dt>To thole the Winter's sleety dribble,
<dd>An' cranreuch cauld!
<p>
<dt>But Mousie, thou are no thy lane,
<dt>In proving foresight may be vain:
<dt>The best laid schemes o' Mice an' Men,
<dd>Gang aft agley,
<dt>An' lea'e us nought but grief an' pain,
<dd>For promis'd joy!
<p>
<dt>Still, thou art blest, compar'd wi' me!
<dt>The present only toucheth thee:
<dt>But och! I backward cast my e'e,
<dd>On prospects drear!
<dt>An' forward, tho' I canna see,
<dd>I guess an' fear!

<H2><IMG  SRC="marker2.gif"><I><A NAME="12"> <font color="#004080">Epistle to a Young Friend</font></A></I></H2>
<UL><DL><P>
<dt><font size="+1">I</font> LANG hae thought, my youthfu' friend,
<dd>  A something to have sent you,
<dt>Tho' it should serve nae ither end
<dd>  Than just a kind momento:
<dt>But how the subject-theme may gang,
<dd>  Let time and change determine;
<dt>Perhaps it may turn out a sang:
<dd>  Perhaps turn out a sermon.
<p>
<dt>Ye'll try the world soon my lad;
<dd>  And, Andrew dear, believe me,
<dt>Ye'll find mankind an unco squad,
<dd>  And muckle they may grieve ye.
<dt>For care and trouble set your thought,
<dd>  Ev'n when your end's attained;
<dt>And a' your views may come to nought,
<dd>  Where ev'ry nerve is strained.
<p>
<dt>I'll no say, men are villains a';
<dd>  The real, harden'd wicked,
<dt>What hae nae check but human law,
<dd>  Are to a few restricked;
<dt>But, och! mankind are unco weak,
<dd>  An' little to be trusted;
<dt>If <i>self</i> the wavering balance shake,
<dd>  It's rarely right adjusted!
<p>
<dt>Yet they wha fa' in fortune's strife,
<dd>  Their fate we shouldna censure;
<dt>For still, th'important end of life
<dd>  They equally may answer;
<dt>A man may hae in honest heart,
<dd>  Tho' poortith hourly stare him;
<dt>A man may tak a neibor's part,
<dd>  Yet hae nae cash to spare him.
<p>
<dt>Aye free, aff-han', your story tell,
<dd>  When wi' a bosom crony;
<dt>But still keep something to yoursel',
<dd>  Ye scarcely tell to ony:
<dt>Conceal yoursel' as weel's ye can
<dd>  Frae critical dissection;
<dt>But keek thro' ev'ry other man,
<dd>  Wi' sharpen'd, sly inspection.
<p>
<dt>The sacred lowe o' well-plac'd love,
<dd>  Luxuriantly indulge it;
<dt>But never tempt th' illicit rove,
<dd>  Tho' naething should divulge it:
<dt>I waive the quantum o' the sin,
<dd>  The hazard of concealing;
<dt>But, och! it hardens a' within,
<dd>  And petrifies the feeling!
<p>
<dt>To catch dame Fortune's golden smile,
<dd>  Assiduous wait upon her;
<dt>And gather gear by ev'ry wile
<dd>  That's justified by honour;
<dt>Not for to hide it in a hedge,
<dd>  Nor for a train attendant;
<dt>But for the glorious privilege
<dd>  Of being independent.
<p>
<dt>The fear o' hell's a hangman's whip,
<dd>  To haud the wretch in order;
<dt>But where ye feel your honour grip,
<dd>  Let that aye be your border;
<dt>Its slightest touches, instant pause--
<dd>  Debar a' side-pretences;
<dt>And resolutely keep its laws,
<dd>  Uncaring consequences.
<p>
<dt>The great Creator to revere,
<dd>  Must sure become the creature;
<dt>But still the preaching cant forbear,
<dd>  And ev'n the rigid feature:
<dt>Yet ne'er with wits profane to range,
<dd>  Be complaisance extended;
<dt>An atheist-laugh's a poor exchange
<dd>  For Deity offended!
<p>
<dt>When ranting round in pleasure's ring,
<dd>  Religion may be blinded;
<dt>Or if she gie a random sting,
<dd>  It may be little minded;
<dt>But when on life we're tempest-driv'n--
<dd>  A conscience but a canker,
<dt>A correspondence fix'd wi' Heav'n,
<dd>  Is sure a noble anchor!
<p>
<dt>Adieu, dear, amiable youth!
<dd>  Your heart can ne'er be wanting!
<dt>May prudence, fortitude, and truth,
<dd>  Erect your brow undaunting!
<dt>In ploughman phrase, ``God send you speed,''
<dd>  Still daily to grow wiser;
<dt>And may ye better reck the rede,
<dd>  Than ever did th' adviser!
