<center><h2>Multilevel marketing madness still among us</h2>
<h3>Call them Multilevel Marketing Militants</h3></center>
<p>
From: The San Diego Union-Tribune, October 20, 1996, Sunday
<br>
A new multilevel marketing operation is tailored to the Common Law
movement -- those folks who claim to be sovereign, and who handle
disputes in their own courtrooms under their own quaint legal
interpretations.
<p>
It's not the first time Common Law militants were involved in
multilevel marketing, which is sometimes called pyramid marketing.
After all, the convicted money launderer M. Elizabeth Broderick of
Palmdale, who learned how to pass out phony comptroller warrants at the
knee of Montana Freeman LeRoy M. Schweitzer, was once a multilevel
marketing huckster.
<p>
The latest one is called Gateway to Financial Freedom, and it's
hawked by the Global Prosperity Marketing Group.  It operates out of
mail drops in the Seattle area, but its security is so tight that its
location is unknown.
<p>
"They are avoiding the semblance of a real office," says Mark Taylor,
editor of San Francisco's Online Fraud Newsletter.  "They are probably
operating out of Canada."
<p>
Gateway makes wild claims: After you have recruited enough people
into the scheme, you make 90 percent profit -- yes, 90 percent -- on
each sale of the company's product.
<p>
What are those products?  The first, Gateway I, costing $1,250, is a
binder of audio cassettes telling you about the evils of the Federal
Reserve, about offshore banking and trusts, as well as Common Law.
<p>
The second, Gateway II, costing $6,250, is a three-day financial
seminar that improves your knowledge of offshore tax strategies,
international trusts, and the like.
<p>
The third, Gateway III, costing $18,750, is a one-week workshop
"presented by renowned international bankers and financiers," according
to promotional materials.
<p>
If any of this sounds familiar to you, congratulations: It's very
similar to the package offered by Orange County-based Investors
International (II), whose astoundingly boastful claims were featured on
these pages in early August. The II program also touted 90 percent
profits, and offered cassettes and tapes on offshore banking and the
like.
<p>
Both Gateway and Investors International claim to provide investors
protection against a grasping and gluttonous government.
<p>
II is aimed at libertarians.  But the founder, one Dr. Rudolf van
Lin, made the mistake of claiming he had been "instrumental in the
forming of the Libertarian Party." He had been no such thing, say the
actual founders of the party, who denounce II as a get-rich-quick scheme
exploiting the Libertarian name.
<p>
"The Libertarian Party has been working to ban advertising of
Investors International" in its publications, says Richard Rider, a
local Libertarian. 
<p>
The Better Business Bureau reviewed materials from Investors
International: "Because the profits are based upon the premise of
recruiting rather than the underlying products or service, this appears
to be an illegal pyramid scheme," says the BBB.
<p>
Michigan has slapped II with a cease-and-desist order.  Oregon also
has moved against the scheme, and the FBI and post office interviewed
van Lin at the outset.  Investors International would not comment on the
moves by government entities and the BBB.
<p>
As far as can be determined, Global Prosperity Marketing was a
separate pyramid -- called a "downline" -- within II. The BBB lists
Global Prosperity as an additional trade name of II.
<p>
"It's my understanding that van Lin was telling Global that its
recorded messages were exaggerated," says a Cincinnatian, who bought
into II and was pitched on Global, and now wants to get his II money
back.
<p>
It's hard to imagine anybody out-exaggerating van Lin, who claims he
has "the most incredible money-making and profit-generating strategic
financial program in the world" -- a program "in which nobody loses."
<p>
A senior executive of II says that Global Prosperity "was a group of
people who were in our organization and are no longer with us.  They
used that name (Global) to sell our products.  They resigned, felt they
could do a different product better."
<p>
However, the differences between the Gateway and II products appear
minor. Certainly, II's package is more expensive.
<p>
The supposed author of Gateway to Financial Freedom is one Keith
Anderson, who, according to the promotional materials, "holds an
Honorary Doctorate degree in Common Law. He has been actively involved
in the study and practice of constitutional law, freedom and sovereignty
for approximately eighteen years. He is highly regarded and recognized
as one of the foremost experts and lecturers on Common Law."
<p>
The group lists its Ethics of Operations.  "All disputes will be
settled by the course of the Common Law," explain the promotional
materials.  "Each party to the complaint may select an equal number of
Common Law judges (not Bar Association members). There is no appeal to
the final decision of the Common Law court judges."
<p>
Product orders are shipped to a Massachusetts operation with its
headquarters in the Turks & Caicos Islands, an offshore tax haven where
Common Law adherents get their driver's licenses.
