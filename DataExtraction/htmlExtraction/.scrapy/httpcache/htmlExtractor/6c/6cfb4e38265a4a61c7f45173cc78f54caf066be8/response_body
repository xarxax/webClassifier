<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sugar industry already has a long 
  tradition with Separation and Filtration. Filtration is that important in only 
  a few industries, so the engineers in the sugar mills have a very practical 
  experience and much knowledge in this field. <img src="Pictures/Leopldrf2.jpg" width="230" height="351" align="right" name="SugarInstallation" alt="Filter installation for sugar Juice"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="333FFF"><b><font color="#3333FF">Filtermat</font></b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> 
  Holland</b> started in sugar industry with delivery of selfcleaning filter systems 
  for beetwash water and for condensers (raw juice and carbonatation). In a later 
  stadium the engineers of a sugar mill asked to develop a system for the filtration 
  of sugar juice (thick juice) just before crystallization. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Such a system, called a "thick juice 
  sugar installation", is a design of several <b>ABF</b> selfcleaning filters, 
  which are connected parallel and build together. This system is controlled by 
  a PLC according to the latest modern standards. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because thick juice is rather viscous 
  and an expensive product for the sugar factory, thin juice or hot water is used 
  as back washing medium. This thin juice will be carried back to an earlier stage 
  in the process flow. <i>There will be no loss of expensive thick juice during 
  this filtration step</i>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sugar industry has a short campagne, 
  so the reliability of the equipment and service of the suppliers is most important.

  Holland</b> has built a very good international reputation in the sugar industry 
  (<a href="RefrncSugar.htm" target="right">see references</a>). <br>
  Of course Filtermat Holland also proves this reputation also in other branches.</font></p>
