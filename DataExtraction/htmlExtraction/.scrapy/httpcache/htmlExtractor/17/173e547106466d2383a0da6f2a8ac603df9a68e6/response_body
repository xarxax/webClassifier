   <title>Elizabeth Cookson</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<h1>Elizabeth Cookson</h1>

<p>Daughter of John Cookson and Mary Jewsbury; born 11 Jan 1810 in Liverpool, 
  she made her reputation with two small books of poetry in 1859/1860 - later 
  gathered with other poems and published as a collected volume in 1868. Other 
  members of the Cookson family had extended links with the Island </p>
<p>Her father was a collector of Customs and Excise (for more than 50 years) and 
  was buried in Onchan on 27 Nov 1844 aged 80. In 1834 John Cookson writes of 
  selling up and, by implication moving to the Island though still keeping his 
  Customs post during the summer. He asks in a later letter for newspapers to 
  be sent to Strathallan Crescent, however he is not found in the 1841 IoM census 
  (subsequently found in Measham Debyshire), and in an 1837 letter his daughter 
  Mary Ann Lloyd writes of her father coming to visit them in Ballasalla so it 
  would appear that he was not at that time resident on the Island though in <a href="../../fulltext/pg1837/do.htm">1837</a> 
  a John Cookson is noted at Castle Mona Lawn.</p>
<p> Elizabeth's parents were known in Island literary circles as friends of the 
  Wordsworth's - Dorothy and William Wordsworth's parents were John Wordsworth 
  and Ann Cookson (from Penrith) , their parents died whilst Dorothy was young 
  and she lived for some time with her Maternal grandparents the Rev William Cookson 
  and wife. However the exact family relationship, if any, between John Cookson 
  and the Wordsworth's is not clear. </p>
<p>The Wordworth's family friends, Thomas Cookson 
  (1771-1833) and Elizabeth Cookson (1774-1868) (note not the poetess Elizabeth discussed on this page), came from Staveley/Kendal . "The 
  friendship was based on a schoolgirl relationship between the poet's sister-in-law, 
  Sara Hutchinson, and Elizabeth Cookson. When the Wordsworths went to Grasmere 
  they came to depend upon Thomas and Elizabeth in a neighbourly kind of way - 
  it was a friendship that had a late flowering since, after Thomas became bankrupt when his woollen business in Kendal collapsed  around 1829 and they moved to the Island where he died in 1833, his widow Elizabeth 
  and several of her daughters returned to Ambleside and around 1843 moved into the 
  poet's old home at Dove Cottage itself." (quoted from a private family letter). 
  Thomas Cookson  is buried at <a href="../../famhist/mis/blre.htm">Ballure</a>:</p>

<blockquote><font size="-1">Sacred to the memory of Thomas Cookson of
   Kendal and Staveley in the county of Westmoreland, who died on the
   20 October 1833, aged 63 years. Elizabeth his wife, who survived
   him thirty five years, died Nov 5, 1868, at Howfoot, in her ninety
   fourth year, and was buried at Grasmere Church.</font></blockquote>

<p>Henry <a href="../../manxnb/v11p145.htm#hcr">Crabb Robinson left a brief account</a> 
  of a visit in 1833 when he accompanied Wordsworth on a visit - "At Bala-sala 
  we called on Mr. and Mrs. Cookson, esteemed friends of the Wordsworths <i>(vide 
  </i><a href="../../fulltext/wd1833.htm#20">Yarrow Revisited," p. 205</a>). I 
  had seen Mrs. Cookson at Kendal formerly: there is something very prepossessing 
  in her person and manners" A surmise is that Thomas died enroute to/from Whitehaven 
  for which Ramsey would be the most convenient port. It is known from a letter 
  from John Cookson that Mary Ann Lloyd (nee Cookson) had also rented a cottage 
  in Ballasalla by July 1833 - John Cookson knew Thomas Cookson but refers to 
  him in a letter to his brother-in-law as old Mr Cookson of Kendal which would 
  seem to imply no close family connection - again it is strange that both Cookson 
  families should have chosen to live in Ballasalla. It is also possible that 
  some of Thomas Cookson's children also resided briefly on the Island.</p>

<p>Thomas was the eldest son of James Cookson (a dyer of Stramongate, Kendal) 
  and also associated with the non-comformist chapel at Kendal - Thomas's and 
  Elizabeth's children include:</p>

<blockquote><font size="-1">William Strictland Cookson (1801-1877): Wordsworth's 
  lawyer and executor; became President of the Law Society and died a very wealthy 
  man. &nbsp;<br>
   Henry Wilkinson Cookson (1810-1876), even more famous; Master of
   Peterhouse, Cambridge.<br>
   James: b. 18 Feb 1803 emigrated to America; d. abt 1885 no known
   children/married<br>
   John: b. 7 Sep 1804, also m., but no children, d. Great
   Barrington, America 3 Jan 1857<br>
   Tom: b. 31 May 1806; m. Esther Thompson; believed to die in
   railway accident</font></blockquote>

<p>Later reports about Mary Ann Lloyd imply that the Peterhouse Henry Cookson 
  was her cousin; Mary Ann also had another link with the Wordsworths in that 
  her cousin Mary Jane Jewsbury made an extended stay with the Wordsworth family 
  in 1825 and whilst there edited a family 'newspaper' - the <i>Kent Bank Mercury</i>.
