        locate equipment, especially hard to find new and used
        equipment/mills/plants. We operate in two different modes: Search and
        Consultant. In the Search mode we can locate equipment or search for
        products required in large quantities.<o:p>

        </b>
        <p><b>In what areas do we specialize? It would be a little easier to
        indicate the areas we don't work. In general, we don't search for
        aircraft, ships, vehicles, pharmaceutical drugs, food, munitions,
        explosives, oil, computer supplies, or readily available commodities.
        Our clients include both USA and overseas companies</b></p>
        <p><b>We are totally independent, we don't look for buyers, sell any
        products, or have any arrangements to market company's products, we only
        locate equipment. We never purchase the product or place the order for a
        client. After we locate equipment, we tie the seller and the client
        together, and continue as an active liaison between both parties until
        the contract has been completed.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </b></p>
        <p><b>We can act as a representative for specification and price
        negotiation, obtain samples, review government regulations, interpret
        terminology, arrange for pre ship inspection, and prepare government
        export documentation. We also provide consulting services for market
        analysis, market penetration, pricing comparisons, and general product
        availability. Our clients are both domestic and overseas companies and
        also include consultants, brokers, and trading companies.<o:p>

        <p><b>Our staff has an engineering background. Therefore, we can
        evaluate a client's specification locate equipment to find effective
        equipment fits. Often we find that a company's specification is based
        more on what some salesperson has shown rather than the most
        cost-effective product that can be obtained.<o:p>
