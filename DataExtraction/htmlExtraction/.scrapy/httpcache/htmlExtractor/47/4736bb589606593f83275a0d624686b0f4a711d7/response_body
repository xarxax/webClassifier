This is the official Evasource Hellsing site. No offense to any other fansites, but ours isn't your
run of the mill la dee fucking da site; we use excessive profanity and are quite secular. If you
have problems coping with references to the death of any Biblical characters, this site is not for you.
The scope of Hellsing's awesomeness can't be described with standard vocabulary so any profane
references made about any religion are to be taken lightly; they are only for comparison's sake. God 
help you if you try to jack our layout because we'll kill you... there's going to be no lawsuit or
trial, we'll just kill you.</p>
