<p><b><font size=+1>Something about the Goose Club of the Alpha Inn</font></b>
<p>Some Sherlockian societies are noted for:
<ul>
<li>
Exciting, well-planned events</li>

<li>
Erudite and polished scholarship</li>

<li>
Great organization and esprit-de-corps</li>

<li>
Dynamic leadership</li>
</ul>
The Goose Club has none of these. We pride ourselves on being one of the
least-organized of all Sherlockian organizations. We have no dues, no treasury,
no planning committees, no publications. What we do have are almost 20
years of traditions and a mailing list.
<p>We had our first meeting in January of 1977, and we have met once every
month since then. In general, we meet at member’s houses in the San Fernando
Valley or West Los Angeles, but we do have a dinner meeting each January,
and we have a picnic in July. Of course, we have traditions at our meetings:
<ul>
<li>
We meet on the third Saturday of each month (unless we don’t)</li>

<li>
Every meeting starts an hour late</li>

<li>
The principal business of each meeting is to decide when and where the
next meeting will be held.</li>

<li>
Trader Joe’s is the Official Snack Food Vendor of the Goose Club.</li>

<li>
There is a Sherlock Holmes story of the evening</li>

<li>
Sometimes, people actually discuss the story of the evening.</li>

<li>
Sometimes, we actually have a QUIZ on the story of the evening.</li>
</ul>
If you want to join or have any questions, please call, fax, or <a href="mailto:%20jpsohl@bigfoot.com">email
</a>at
any time.
