<h1>Retail Conferences 2017</h1>Having produced our 10th annual Retail Conference in 2016 we decided it was time to review and refresh our format and approach. Taking attendee feedback into account, and for the first time in 2017, we will be producing two annual events, each with specific themes and focus. 
<br><br>
<strong>On 17th May 2017 we will be delivering the <a href="/cx/ "title="Retail Customer Experience Conference">Retail Customer Experience Conference</a></strong>. 
<br><br>
Our delegates feedback highlighted that in recent years most retail events had focused on ecommerce, mcommerce, social media and digital/technology. Front line store operations, a critical component of the omni-channel customer experience, have become the poor-relative to conferences focused on 'exciting new developments'. With the ONS reporting that 80%+ of all retail sales are STILL served through stores (whether through traditional sales or click-and-collect), it seemed madness that there wasn't an event dedicated to retail operations and customer experience professionals. 
<br><br>
So, for the first time in 2017, we will be presenting a conference for all those who are responsible for ensuring that stores deliver a consistent, cohesive customer experience, appropriately representing their retail brand, in an efficient and profitable manner. You can find out more via <a href="/cx/ "title="Retail Customer Experience Conference">Retail Customer Experience Conference</a>

<br><br>
<strong>Then, on 15th November 2017 we will be delivering the <a href="/scm/ "title="Retail Supply Chain Management Conference"> Retail Supply Chain Management Conference </a></strong>. 
<br><br>
Our attendees had also commented that there are few forums that consider best-practice in the end to end retail supply chain. With the omni-channel customer demanding more rapid and flexible fulfilment and returns options, more and more pressure, and cost, is placed on the outbound, and reverse, logistics and supply chain operations.
<br><br>
Feedback also suggests that the core supply chain is also challenged - with the business need for more efficient flow of stock, reducing out of stocks, maximising lost sales potential, whilst limiting the cost of clearance due to obsolescence. As customers expect more frequent range changes and extended online offerings (leading to increased SKU counts) the merchandise and assortment planning, demand forecasting and replenishment processes have dramatically increased in complexity. 
<br><br>
So, for the first time in 2017, we will be presenting a conference that focuses on how retailers can address these challenges, ensuring they have a well-planned, efficient supply chain that supports the business needs, the customer demands, whilst not haemorrhaging profit. You can find out more via <a href="/scm/ "title="Retail Supply Chain Management Conference"> Retail Supply Chain Management Conference</a>.<h1>Why should you attend one of The Retail Conferences?</h1>By attending one, or both, of The Retail Conferences, you will be placing yourself ahead of your peers as a <strong>fresh, forward-thinking retailer</strong> who is not afraid to embrace change and innovation to secure your place in the future.
