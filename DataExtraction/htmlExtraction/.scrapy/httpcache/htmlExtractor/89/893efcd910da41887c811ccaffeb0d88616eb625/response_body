<ul><dl><P>
<DT><font size="+1">I</font>N Xanadu did Kubla Khan
<DT>A stately pleasure-dome decree:
<DT>Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
<DT>Through caverns measureless to man
<DT>Down to a sunless sea.
<DT>So twice five miles of fertile ground
<DT>With walls and towers were girdled round:
<DT>And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,
<DT>Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
<DT>And here were forests ancient as the hills,
<DT>Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.<p>
<DT>But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
<DT>Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
<DT>A savage place! as holy and enchanted
<DT>As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted
<DT>By woman wailing for her demon-lover!
<DT>And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,
<DT>As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,
<DT>A mighty fountain momently was forced:
<DT>Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
<DT>Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,
<DT>Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:
<DT>And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
<DT>It flung up momently the sacred river.
<DT>Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
<DT>Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,
<DT>Then reached the caverns measureless to man,
<DT>And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:
<DT>And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
<DT>Ancestral voices prophesying war!
<DD>The shadow of the dome of pleasure
<DD>Floated midway on the waves;
<DD>Where was heard the mingled measure
<DD>From the fountain and the caves.
<DT>It was a miracle of rare device,
<DT>A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!
<DD>A damsel with a dulcimer
<DD>In a vision once I saw:
<DD>It was an Abyssinian maid,
<DD>And on her dulcimer she played,
<DD>Singing of Mount Abora.
<DD>Could I revive within me
<DD>Her symphony and song,
<DD>To such a deep delight 'twould win me,
<DD>That with music loud and long,
<DD>I would build that dome in air,
<DD>That sunny dome! those caves of ice!
<DD>And all who heard should see them there,
<DD>And all should cry, Beware! Beware!
<DD>His flashing eyes, his floating hair!
<DD>Weave a circle round him thrice,
<DD>And close your eyes with holy dread,
<DD>For he on honey-dew hath fed,
<DD>And drunk the milk of Paradise.

<ul><dl>
<i>Lines composed 21st February 1825</i><P>
<dt><font size="+1">A</font>LL Nature seems at work.  Slugs leave their lair--
<dt>The bees are stirring--birds are on the wing--
<dt>And Winter slumbering in the open air,
<dt>Wears on his smiling face a dream of Spring!
<dt>And I the while, the sole unbusy thing,
<dt>Nor honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing.<p>
<dd>Yet well I ken the banks where amaranths blow,
<dt>Have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow.
<dt>Bloom, O ye amaranths! bloom for whom ye may,
<dt>For me ye bloom not! Glide, rich streams, away!
<dt>With lips unbrightened, wreathless brow, I stroll:
<dt>And would you learn the spells that drowse my soul?
<dt>Work without Hope draws nectar in a sieve,
<dt>And Hope without an object cannot live.

<ul><dl>
<i>Composed at Clevedon, Somersetshire</i><P>
<dt><font size="+1">M</font>Y pensive Sara! thy soft cheek reclined
<dt>Thus on my arm, most soothing sweet it is
<dt>To sit beside our Cot, our Cot o'ergrown
<dt>With white-flower'd Jasmin, and the broad-leav'd Myrtle,
<dt>(Meet emblems they of Innocence and Love!)
<dt>And watch the clouds, that late were rich with light,
<dt>Slow saddening round, and mark the star of eve
<dt>Serenely brilliant (such should Wisdom be)
<dt>Shine opposite!  How exquisite the scents
<dt>Snatch'd from yon bean-field! and the world <i>so</i> hush'd!
<dt>The stilly murmur of the distant Sea
<dt>Tells us of silence.
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that simplest Lute,
<dt>Placed length-ways in the clasping casement, hark!
<dt>How by the desultory breeze caress'd,
<dt>Like some coy maid half yielding to her lover,
<dt>It pours such sweet upbraiding, as must needs
<dt>Tempt to repeat the wrong!  And now, its strings
<dt>Boldlier swept, the long sequacious notes
<dt>Over delicious surges sink and rise,
<dt>Such a soft floating witchery of sound
<dt>As twilight Elfins make, when they at eve
<dt>Voyage on gentle gales from Fairy-Land,
<dt>Where Melodies round honey-dropping flowers,
<dt>Footless and wild, like birds of Paradise,
<dt>Nor pause, nor perch, hovering on untam'd wing!
<dt>O! the one Life within us and abroad,
<dt>Which meets all motion and becomes its soul,
<dt>A light in sound, a sound-like power in light,
<dt>Rhythm in all thought, and joyance every where--
<dt>Methinks, it should have been impossible
<dt>Not to love all things in a world so fill'd;
<dt>Where the breeze warbles, and the mute still air
<dt>Is Music slumbering on her instrument.<p>
<dd>And thus, my Love! as on the midway slope
<dt>Of yonder hill I stretch my limbs at noon,
<dt>Whilst through my half-clos'd eye-lids I behold
<dt>The sunbeams dance, like diamonds, on the main,
<dt>And tranquil muse upon tranquility;
<dt>Full many a thought uncall'd and undetain'd,
<dt>And many idle flitting phantasies,
<dt>Traverse my indolent and passive brain,
<dt>As wild and various as the random gales
<dt>That swell and flutter on the subject Lute!
<dd>And what if all of animated nature
<dt>Be but organic Harps diversely fram'd,
<dt>That tremble into thought, as o'er them sweeps
<dt>Plastic and vast, one intelletual breeze,
<dt>At once the Soul of each, and God of all?
<dd>But thy more serious eye a mild reproof
<dt>Darts, O beloved Woman! nor such thoughts
<dt>Dim and unhallow'd dost thou not reject,
<dt>And biddest me walk humbly with my God.
<dt>Meek Daughter in the family of Christ!
<dt>Well hast thou said and holily disprais'd
<dt>These shapings of the unregenerate mind;
<dt>Bubbles that glitter as they rise and break
<dt>On vain Philosophy's aye-babbling spring.
<dt>For never guiltless may I speak of him,
<dt>The Incomprehensible! save when with awe
<dt>I praise him, and with Faith that only <i>feels</i>;
<dt>Who with his saving mercies healed me,
<dt>A sinful and most miserable man,
<dt>Wilder'd and dark, and gave me to possess
<dt>Peace, and this Cot, and thee, heart-honour'd Maid!

<ul><dl><P>
<dt><font size="+1">T</font>HE Frost performs its secret ministry,
<dt>Unhelped by an wind.  The owlet's cry
<dt>Came loud--and hark, again! loud as before.
<dt>The inmates of my cottage, all at rest,
<dt>Have left me to that solitude, which suits
<dt>Abstruser musings: save that at my side
<dt>My cradled infant slumbers peacefully.
<dt>'Tis calm indeed! so calm, that it disturbs
<dt>And vexes meditation with its strange
<dt>And extreme silentness.  Sea, hill, and wood,
<dt>This populous village! Sea, and hill, and wood,
<dt>With all the numberless goings-on of life,
<dt>Inaudible as dreams!  the thin blue flame
<dt>Lies on my low-burnt fire, and quivers not;
<dt>Only that film, which fluttered on the grate,
<dt>Still flutters there, the sole unquiet thing.
<dt>Methinks, its motion in this hush of nature
<dt>Gives it dim sympathies with me who live,
<dt>Making it a companionable form,
<dt>Whose puny flaps and freaks the idling Spirit
<dt>By its own moods interprets, every where
<dt>Echo or mirror seeking of itself,
<dt>And makes a toy of Thought.
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But O! how oft,
<dt>How oft, at school, with most believing mind,
<dt>Presageful, have I gazed upon the bars,
<dt>To watch that fluttering <i>stranger!</i> and as oft
<dt>With unclosed lids, already had I dreamt
<dt>Of my sweet birth-place, and the old church-tower,
<dt>Whose bells, the poor man's only music, rang
<dt>From morn to evening, all the hot Fair-day,
<dt>So sweetly, that they stirred and haunted me
<dt>With a wild pleasure, falling on mine ear
<dt>Most like articulate sounds of things to come!
<dt>So gazed I, till the soothing things, I dreamt,
<dt>Lulled me to sleep, and sleep prolonged my dreams!
<dt>And so I brooded all the following morn,
<dt>Awed by the stern preceptor's face, mine eye
<dt>Fixed with mick study on my swimming book:
<dt>Save if the door half opened, and I snatched
<dt>A hasty glance, and still my heart leaped up,
<dt>For still I hoped to see the <i>stranger's</i> face,
<dt>Townsman, or aunt, or sister more beloved,
<dt>My play-mate when we both were clothed alike!
<p>
<dd>  Dear Babe, that sleepest cradled by my side,
<dt>Whose gentle breathings, heard in this deep calm,
<dt>Fill up the interspersed vacancies
<dt>And momentary pauses of the thought!
<dt>My babe so beautiful! it thrills my heart
<dt>With tender gladness, thus to look at thee,
<dt>And think that thou shalt learn far other lore,
<dt>And in far other scenes!  For I was reared
<dt>In the great city, pent 'mid cloisters dim,
<dt>And saw nought lovely but the sky and stars.
<dt>But <i>thou</i>, my babe! shalt wander like a breeze
<dt>By lakes and sandy shores, beneath the clouds,
<dt>Which image in their bulk both lakes and shores
<dt>And mountain crags: so shalt thou see and hear
<dt>The lovely shapes and sounds intelligible
<dt>Of that eternal language, which thy God
<dt>Utters, who from eternity, doth teach
<dt>Himself in all, and all things in himself.
<dt>Great universal Teacher! he shall mould
<dt>Thy spirit, and by giving make it ask.
<P>
<dd>  Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee,
<dt>Whether summer clothe the general earth
<dt>With greeness, or the redbreast sit and sing
<dt>Betwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branch
<dt>Of mossy apple-tree, while the nigh thatch
<dt>Smokes in the sun-thaw; whether the eave-drops fall
<dt>Heard only in the trances of the blast,
<dt>Or if the secret ministry of frost
<dt>Shall hang them up in silent icicles,
<dt>Quietly shining to the quiet Moon.

<H2><IMG  SRC="marker2.gif"><a name="8"><i> <font color="#004080">This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison</font></i></a></H2>
<ul><dl>
<i>In the June of 1797 some long-expected friends paid a visit to the author's cottage; and on the morning of their arrival, he met with an accident, which disabled him from walking during the whole time of their stay.  One evening, when they had left him for a few hours, he composed the following lines in the garden-bower.</i><P>
<dt><font size="+1">W</font>ELL, they are gone, and here must I remain,
<dt>This lime-tree bower my prison!  I have lost
<dt>Beauties and feelings, such as would have been
<dt>Most sweet to my remembrance even when age
<dt>Had dimm'd mine eyes to blindness!  They, meanwhile,
<dt>Friends, whom I never more may meet again,
<dt>On springy heath, along the hill-top edge,
<dt>Wander in gladness, and wind down, perchance,
<dt>To that still roaring dell, of which I told;
<dt>The roaring dell, o'erwooded, narrow, deep,
<dt>And only speckled by the mid-day sun;
<dt>Where its slim trunk the ash from rock to rock
<dt>Flings arching like a bridge;--that branchless ash,
<dt>Unsunn'd and damp, whose few poor yellow leaves
<dt>Ne'er tremble in the gale, yet tremble still,
<dt>Fann'd by the water-fall! and there my friends
<dt>Behold the dark green file of long lank weeds,
<dt>That all at once (a most fantastic sight!)
<dt>Still nod and drip beneath the dripping edge
<dt>Of the blue clay-stone.
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, my friends emerge
<dt>Beneath the wide wide Heaven--and view again
<dt>The many-steepled tract magnificent
<dt>Of hilly fields and meadows, and the sea,
<dt>With some fair bark, perhaps, whose sails light up
<dt>The slip of smooth clear blue betwixt two Isles
<dt>Of purple shadow!  Yes!  they wander on
<dt>In gladness all; but thou, methinks, most glad,
<dt>My gentle-hearted Charles! for thou hast pined
<dt>And hunger'd after Nature, many a year,
<dt>In the great City pent, winning thy way
<dt>With sad yet patient soul, through evil and pain
<dt>And strange calamity!  Ah! slowly sink
<dt>Behind the western ridge, thou glorious Sun!
<dt>Shine in the slant beams of the sinking orb,
<dt>Ye purple heath-flowers! richlier burn, ye clouds!
<dt>Live in the yellow light, ye distant groves!
<dt>And kindle, thou blue Ocean!  So my friend
<dt>Struck with deep joy may stand, as I have stood,
<dt>Silent with swimming sense; yea, gazing round
<dt>On the wide landscape, gaze till all doth seem
<dt>Less gross than bodily; and of such hues
<dt>As veil the Almighty Spirit, when yet he makes
<dt>Spirits perceive his presence.
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A delight
<dt>Comes sudden on my heart, and I am glad
<dt>As I myself were there!  Nor in ths bower,
<dt>This little lime-tree bower, have I not mark'd
<dt>Much that has sooth'd me.  Pale beneath the blaze
<dt>Hung with transparent foliage; and I watch'd
<dt>Some broad and sunny leaf, and lov'd to see
<dt>The shadow of the leaf and stem above
<dt>Dappling its sunshine!  And that walnut-tree
<dt>Was richly ting'd, and a deep radiance lay
<dt>Full on the ancient ivy, which usurps
<dt>Those fronting elms, and now, with blackest mass
<dt>Makes their dark branches gleam a lighter hue
<dt>Through the late twilight: and though now the bat
<dt>Wheels silent by, and not a swallow twitters,
<dt>Yet still the solitary humble-bee
<dt>Sings in the bean-flower!  Henceforth I shall know
<dt>That Nature ne'er deserts the wise and pure;
<dt>No plot so narrow, be but Nature there,
<dt>No waste so vacant, but may well employ
<dt>Each faculty of sense, and keep the heart
<dt>Awake to Love and Beauty! and sometimes
<dt>'Tis well to be bereft of promis'd good,
<dt>That we may lift the soul, and contemplate
<dt>With lively joy the joys we cannot share.
<dt>My gentle-hearted Charles! when the last rook
<dt>Beat its straight path along the dusky air
<dt>Homewards, I blest it! deeming its black wing
<dt>(Now a dim speck, now vanishing in light)
<dt>Had cross'd the mighty Orb's dilated glory,
<dt>While thou stood'st gazing; or, when all was still,
<dt>Flew creeking o'er thy head, and had a charm
<dt>For thee, my gentle-hearted Charles, to whom
<dt>No sound is dissonant which tells of Life.
