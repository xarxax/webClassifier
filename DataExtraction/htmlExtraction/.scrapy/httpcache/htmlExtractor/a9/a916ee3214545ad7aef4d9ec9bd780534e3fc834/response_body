<h1>Ralph Ellison--from leftist reviews to modernist interiority</h1>
<h2>An excerpt from Thomas Hill Schaub's <i>American Fiction in the
Cold War</i> (Wisconsin, 1991)</h2>
<hr>

In book reviews for <i>New Masses</i> from 1939 to 1941, 
[Ellison's] Marxist
perspective remains a central element. In "Ruling Class
Southerner," for example, he faults the author for failing to
make his central character "the personalization of the
sociological facts" and argues that "no matter how powerful an
individual may become, he is dependent upon others with similar
interests; it is this group's consciousness of itself as a
class . . . that is responsible" ([p] 27). In "Anti-War Novel"
Ellison suggests that Spring Offensive, a novel by Herbert
Lewis, is unlikely to receive attention from "the capitalist
press," and admires the book for showing "a degree of class
consciousness" and "nuances of American class struggle" (29-
30). Similarly, Ellison praises 
<a href=walk-hard.html>Len Zinberg's novel <i>Walk Hard,
Talk Loud</i></a> for showing a boy's coming to see his relation to a
"diseased social order" and notes that the success of Zinberg,
a white writer, derives from his "Marxist understanding of the
economic basis of Negro personality" ("Negro Prize Fighter,"
27).
<p>
Looking back through these first essays, one notices not only
that Ellison easily accommodated Marxist ideology with other
themes that he has since retained, but also that within the
context of that time, his determination to situate the black
American within the terms of universality was far from
reactionary. Ellison was preoccupied with the need to displace
"stereotyped roles which ignore Negro problems and Negro
reality" with roles and portraits that acknowledged a greater
"range of emotion." "It was a long Broadway tradition," he
notes in his review of Theodore Ward's <i>Big White Fog</i>, "that the
Negro should never be shown as capable of the universal emotion
of love" (22). In "Stormy Weather," his review of Langston
Hughes's autobiography <i>The Big Sea</i>, Ellison faults the author
for avoiding "analysis and comment . . . that unity which is
formed by the mind's brooding over experience and transforming
it into conscious thought." Had Hughes supplied such
commentary, "we would be shown the processes by which a
sensitive Negro attains a heightened consciousness of a world
in which most of the odds are against his doing so" (20-21). In
formulations such as this one, which seem to anticipate so
explicitly the project of <i>Invisible Man</i>, the Marxist
terminology of "historic process" gives way effortlessly to the
growth of mind as the territory within which social change must
occur. "It will be the spread of this consciousness," Ellison
concluded, "added to the passion and sensitivity of the Negro
people, that will help create a new way of life in the United
States" (21).
<p>
In itself, this modernist move toward the interiority of
psychological realism might have proven uncontroversial, but
such readers as Kaiser, Addison Gayle, and Houston Baker, Jr.,
have seen in Ellison's version of the "heightened
consciousness" a Eurocentric view of the artist which
subordinates African American culture to "conscious" art and
separates that art from politics. In his
essay "To Move without Moving: An Analysis of Creativity and
Commerce in Ralph Ellison's Trueblood Episode," Houston Baker,
Jr., attempts to recover Invisible Man from these charges by
arguing that "the distinction between folklore and literary art
evident in Ellison's critical practice collapses in his
creative practice" (829).
<p>
Though Ellison has always maintained that art and politics are
different realms, it is worth recalling that Ellison developed
as a writer during a time when the separation of art and
politics not only seemed possible, but, in view of recent
events, necessary. There have been many accounts of the
experience of black Americans with the Communist Party, but
most of them agree on the essentials which Ellison summarized
years later: "The Communists recognized no plurality of
interests and were really responding to the necessities of
Soviet foreign policy, and when the war came, Negroes got
caught and were made expedient in the shifting of policy."
In this development, Ellison's
experience was not unlike that of Rahv, Trilling, and Chase;
like them he understood political literature to be a form of
propaganda, while "art"being faithful to the ironic
complexities of experiencewas inherently anti-ideological.
<p>
Today this position seems at once naive and reactionary, but
once relocated within the discursive context from which it
emerged, the separating of art and politics becomes a more
complex event, and regains some of its original plausibility. 
More than that: within the African American community that
distinction participates in a strategy of withdrawal from
centers of power, both democratic and communist, that was
provoked by a crisis in black American leadership during World
War II. The story that Ellison has told on several occasions
about the origin of Invisible Man always involves the failure
of this leadership, so that students of the novel have long
recognized that the book details the difficulties of a young
black man who seeks to become a leader. But accounts such as
those by M. K. Singleton and John S. Wright, as useful and
eloquent as they are, pursue the mythic discourse of the novel
and follow the lead given them by Ellison's references to Lord
Raglan and Kenneth Burke. In doing so, they foreground the
contemplative character of the novel and lose sight of the
controversy over "Negro leadership" which supplies access to
Ellison's contemporary history and to the more active and
political dimension of the novel. Returning to this discourse
helps us work against the novel's universalism and its explicit
tendencies to veer toward caricature and allegory, away from
contemporary reference.
