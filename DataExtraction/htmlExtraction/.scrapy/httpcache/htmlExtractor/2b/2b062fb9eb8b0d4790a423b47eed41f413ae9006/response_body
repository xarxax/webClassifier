<h1 align=center>A Guide to Samuel Johnson</h1>

<h2 align=centr>By <a
href="http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/">Jack Lynch</a></h2>

A number of requests for information on Johnson &#0151; they come 
my way because of my <a 
href="http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Johnson/">Johnson 
page</a> on the Web, my <a 
href="http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Diss/">dissertation</a> 
largely on Johnson, and a number of <a 
href="http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/books.html">books</a> 
on the subject &#0151; have convinced me to put together a few 
paragraphs to introduce novices to Johnson.<p>

This is nothing like a comprehensive guide to the literature,
although I do discuss some real bibliographies.  I cover a few
works of scholarship, and those not necessarily my favorites &#0151;
they're the ones that I think are most important for a beginner
to know, the most often quoted, though not always the most
thought-provoking.  And this guide is unabashedly opinionated,
though I hope my preferences aren't often perversely far from
the mainstream.  Still, it might be useful for people who've
received no more formal introduction to Johnson studies.<p>

I don't pretend for a minute that this guide is anywhere near
complete or comprehensive &#0151; it was prepared off the top of my
head.  I don't know whether my omissions of important material
are more grievous than the outright errors that are doubtless in
here somewhere.  But it might be useful to someone just getting
started, and, since it's free, it would be a bargain at twice
the price.  I welcome comments and corrections; my address
appears below.
