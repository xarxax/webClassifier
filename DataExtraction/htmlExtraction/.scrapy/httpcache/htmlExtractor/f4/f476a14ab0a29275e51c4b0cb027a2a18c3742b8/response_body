<h4 align="center">An excerpt from &quot;The Prophet&quot; by Kahlil Gibran</h4>
<p align="center"><br />Then said a rich man, &quot;Speak to us of Giving.&quot;<br />
  And he answered:</p>
<p align="center">
  You give but little when you give of your possessions.<br />
It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.</p>
<p align="center">
  For what are your possessions but 
  things<br />             
  you keep and guard<br />              
  for fear you may need them tomorrow?<br />  
  And tomorrow, what shall 
  tomorrow<br /> 
  bring to the over prudent dog<br /> 
  burying bones in the trackless sand as he follows the<br />
  pilgrims to the holy city?<br />
  And what is fear of need but need 
  itself?<br />
  Is not dread of thirst when your well is 
  full,<br />
the thirst that is unquenchable?</p>
<p align="center">       
  There are those who give little<br />
  of the much which they 
  have-<br />           
  and they give it<br />
  for recognition and their hidden desire<br />
  makes their gifts unwholesome.<br />
  And there are those who have little and give it all.<br />
  These are the believers in life and the bounty of 
  life,<br />
  and their coffer is never empty.<br />
  There are those who give with joy,<br />
  and their joy is their reward.<br />              
  And there are those who give with 
  pain,<br />
  and that pain is their baptism.<br />
  And there are those who give and know 
  not<br />
  pain in giving, nor do they seek joy,<br />
  nor give with mindfulness of virtue:<br />
  They give as in yonder valley the 
  myrtle<br />
  breathes its fragrance into space.<br />
  Through the hands of such as these God<br />
  speaks, and from behind their eyes<br />
He smiles upon the earth.</p>
<p align="center">
  It is well to give when asked, but it is<br />
  better to give unasked, through understanding:<br />
  And to the open-handed the search for<br />
  one who shall receive is joy greater than giving.<br />
  And is there aught your would withhold?<br />
  All you have shall some day be given:<br />
  Therefore give now, that the season of<br />
giving may be yours and not your inheritors`.</p>
<p align="center">You often say,&quot;I would give, but only to the deserving.&quot;<br />
  The trees in your orchard say not so,<br />
  nor the flocks in your pasture.<br />
  They give that they may 
  live,<br />
  for to with-hold is to perish.<br />
  Surely he who is worthy to receive his<br />
  days and nights, is worthy of all else from 
  you.<br />
  And he who has deserved to drink from<br />
  the ocean of life deserves to fill his cup from your little stream.<br />
  And what desert greater shall there 
  be,<br />
  than that, which lies in the courage and the<br />
  confidence, nay the charity, of receiving?<br />
  And who are you that men should 
  rend<br />
  their bosom and unveil their pride,<br />
  that you may see their worth 
  naked and their pride unabashed?<br />
  See first that you yourself deserve to be<br />
a giver,and an instrument of giving.      </p>
<p align="center">
  For in truth it is life that gives unto life-<br />
  while you, who deem yourself a giver are but a 
witness.</p>
<p align="center">And you receivers- and you are all<br />
  receivers- assume no weight of gratitude,<br />
  lest you lay a yoke upon<br />
  yourself and upon he who gives.<br />
  Rather rise together with the giver 
  on his gifts as on wings:<br />
  For to be overmindful of your debt,is<br />
  to doubt his generosity who has the<br />
  free-hearted earth for mother,and God for 
father</p>
<h4 align="center">Kahlil Gibran's book, published in 1923 is especially 
  relevant and&nbsp; helpful<br />
  for these times and is a wonderful gift for yourself or a loved one.<br />
