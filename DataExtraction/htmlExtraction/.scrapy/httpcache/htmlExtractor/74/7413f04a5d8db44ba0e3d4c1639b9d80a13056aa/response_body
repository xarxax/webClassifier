Cityscapes are the interfaces "of a live interchange between the heroes and the environment."  Cityscapes have "unstable boundaries," lessons in "the eroticism of the unseen," and "multidimensionality."

<LI><STRONG>Some early Henry James short stories, uncollected by James unless otherwise indicated</STRONG> <blockquote>

<P>
<LI> <A HREF="http://www.newpaltz.edu/~hathawar/briseux.pdf">The Sweetheart of M. Briseux</A>- in .pdf format - a searchable photographic image of the original printing in The Galaxy, June 1873.  Two painters: a starving genius with burning eyes contrasted with a well-fed, self-satisfied incompetent--with a woman to tell the tale.
<P>
<LI>  <A HREF="http://www.newpaltz.edu/~hathawar/lightman.pdf">A Light Man</A>- in .pdf format - a searchable photographic image of the original printing in The Galaxy, July 1869.  Later revised twice, the second time for Stories Revived (1885).  James's epigraph invites us to compare this story with Robert Browning's "A Light Woman," as Sheldon Novick points out in his biography of James (Vol. I, pp. 181-82).
<P>

<LI>  <A HREF="http://www.newpaltz.edu/~hathawar/travcomp.pdf">Travelling Companions </A>- in .pdf format - a searchable photographic image of the original printing in The Atlantic Monthly of November-December, 1870 - Fruit of James's Italian tour of 1869-70, this romantic love story is richly furnished, almost overly furnished, with impressions of painting, architecture, and Italian atmosphere. Venice, to a young man, just discovering that he is in love, appears in a "golden glow," "a golden clearness so perfect that the rosy flush on the marble palaces seemed as light and pure as the life-blood on the forehead of a sleeping child." A good story to contrast with "The Aspern Papers."
<P>
<LI>  <A HREF="http://www.newpaltz.edu/~hathawar/osborne.pdf">Osborne's Revenge </A> 
- in .pdf format - a searchable photographic image of the original printing in The Galaxy of July 1868. 
This story eschews the romantic elements found in several of James's very early stories.  The ironic reversal 
at the end, undermining and changing everything that has gone before, may remind readers of the ironic reversal in The Ambassadors.
<P>
<LI> <A HREF="http://www.newpaltz.edu/~hathawar/storyofayear.html">The Story of a

soldier. The moralizing and "fine writing" of a young author, together with

1865).

Henry James's letters to Hendrik Andersen </A> - a commentary by Jed Perl, art critic of <i>The New Republic</i>, on James's criticisms of Hendrik Andersen's sculpture. 
 James writes, for example, "I sometimes find your sexes not quite intensely enough differentiated"; the ladies resemble "a shade too much the gentlemen."  
Some sculptures of lovers are "noble & admirable"; but, James writes to Andersen, he doesn't "find the hands, on the backs, living enough & participant enough 
in the kiss. They would be, in life, very participant--to their finger-tips & would show it in many ways."<P>

for papers</H4><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><UL>


<LI><STRONG>NEW: </strong>

The Henry James Society invites papers for the following panel at the 30th Annual Conference of the American Literature Association, to be held in Boston, MA 23-26 May at the Westin Copley Place <p>

"Theatrical James" <p>

Henry James's early exposure to, and great delight in, the theatre is amply documented in his autobiographies. His fascination for the stage and his interest in drama as a narrative mode found expression in his work from the very beginning of his career, and informed several of his short stories and novels well before he actually tried his hand at playwriting. The Henry James Society invites papers that examine stage effects, dramatic (and/or melodramatic) scenes, histrionics, stage metaphors, references or allusions to plays, in James's production before 1889. <p>

Send 200-300 word abstracts to Leonardo Buonomo (buonomo@units.it) and Greg W. Zacharias (GREGZACHARIAS@creighton.edu) by January 20, 2019<p> 




<LI><STRONG>NEW: 

Henry James Society<br>

8th International Conference, Trieste 4-6 July 2019<br>

The Sound of James: The Aural Dimension in Henry James's Work<br>
</strong>
<p>

 

While James's hyper-active eye, his keen sensitivity to the visual, and abundant literary use of painting, have been the subject of extensive and probing scholarship, his attention to sound, and indeed his general relationship with it, have been only sporadically examined. And yet even a cursory glance at James's long career reveals his continuing alertness and discriminating responsiveness to auditory experience.  From his early tales of the 1860s to his thre massive novels of the first decade of the twentieth century, from his first travel pieces to The American Scene and Italian Hours, and throughout his criticism, autobiographies, notebooks, correspondence and unfinished work, James recorded the constantly changing soundscapes of the United States and Europe and left significant evidence of his interest in, and commitment to, the aural dimension of his writing. No less than his eye, James's ear captured the minutest nuances of social, cultural, local and national difference and transformation, together with the impact of technology, and the role of music as an element of setting or a delineator of character.
<p>
The Henry James Society invites papers and complete panel proposals on the many facets of James's relationship with sound. Possible topics include but are not limited to:<p>

The new sounds of modernity and technology

<br>Noise
<br>
The sounds of multi-ethnic America 
<br>
The question of speech (American vs British) 
<br>
Speech as a marker of class 
<br>
Gender-based speech 
<br>
The distinctive voice of James's narrators 
<br>
Sound effects in James's writing
<br>
The role of listening or hearing
<br>
The sonics of James's style
<br>
Silences in James's writing
<br>
James's use of foreign words and/or rendering of foreign languages and accents in English
<br>
Pronunciation and diction
<br>
The sound of James in translation
<br>
Music in James and/or James set to music
<br>
The effect of dictation on James's writing
<br>
The sound of James in stage, radio, film, and television adaptations
<br>
Jamesian echoes during his lifetime and after

 <p>

Please send an abstract (250 words) and a short biographpy (one paragraph) as well as panel proposals to Leonardo Buonomo, conference director (buonomo@units.it), Giulia Iannuzzi (giannuzzi@units.it), and Greg Zacharias (gwzach@creighton.edu) by December 15, 2018.
