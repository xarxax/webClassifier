            <P><FONT SIZE="+1">St. Hilda was the 7th century Abbess who founded
            the Monastery of Whitby. Under her wise rule, it became the most
            celebrated religious house and center of learning in Northeast
            England. Several of her charges became bishops and abbesses,
            and it was through her guidance that Caedmon, a humble farm laborer
            on the monastic estate, became known to us as the first English
            poet. <I>The Other Voice</I> presents a scenario of how Hilda
            might have brought this to pass.</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT SIZE="+1">This dramatic work calls for a cast of four
            who speak and sing. Hilda of Whitby is a Mezzo-soprano, the princess
            Elfleda is a lyric Soprano, Rolf the Reeve is a Baritone and
            Caedmon is a light Tenor. The accompaniment may be played on
            the organ, on a piano, or a synthesizer. The chorus in the final
            scene is optional. It's an accessible work, scenery needs are
            minimal, and yet it will be a rewarding production for your audience.</FONT></P>

            my eye is a relatively small-scale dramatic work by Starer entitled
            <I>The Other Voice: A Portrait of Hilda of Whitby</I>. The text
            for this little opera is by Gail Godwin, who may be recognized
            as the author of <I>Father Melancholy's Daughter</I>. (If you
            haven't read this charming book, let me recommend it to you.)
            There are four roles: Hilda, abbess of Whitby (mezzo); Elfleda,
            princess and nun (soprano); Rolf, the Reeve (baritone); and Caedmon,
            cowherd and poet (tenor). Production notes state that &quot;The
            accompaniment may be played on an organ, on the piano, or on
            a <I>synthesizer with judiciously selected sound images.</I>&quot;
            --the italics are mine. I do not think I have ever seen this
            rubric before, but will be surprised if I do not see it--or something
            similar--again. The chorus used (very briefly) in the last scene
            is optional. One of my cherished hopes is that my parish will
            be able to present occasional musico-dramatic productions. It's

            It is the late 660's, and spring is finally on its way to the
            cold coast of Northeast England. Hilda, beloved abbess of Whitby,
            esteemed far and wide as the most influential woman in Anglo-Saxon
            Christendom, is where she most likes to be: alone with God, taking
            refreshment and courage from her prayers. She is in her mid-fifties.
            Her early adult life remains undisclosed, but we know that at
            age thirty-three she took vows as a nun, ruled over the monastery
            of Hartlepool as abbess, and went on to transform a desolate
            Whitby cliff overlooking the North Sea into a thriving monastery
            for men and women, a center of learning, and a place visited
            by kings, princes, bishops and other seekers of her wisdom and
            advice. The famous Synod of Whitby where Celtic and Roman-trained
            Bishops argued their differences before King Oswy to settle the
            date of Easter, took place at Hilda's monastery in 664.</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT SIZE="+1">Hilda has also raised the Princess Elfleda,
            whose father, King Oswy, gave the baby princess to the Christian
            God as a thank offering for letting him defeat the heathen king
            Penda in battle. Elfleda, who will soon be taking her first vows
            as a nun, interrupts Hilda's prayers. The teenage princess has
            just come back from an ecstatic evening walk along the cliff,
            where she heard the ice cracking, saw Caedmon the herdsman delivering
            a new lamb, and stopped to chat with Rolf the Reeve, who oversees
            the workings of the monastery estate. The Princess admires Rolf
            because he &quot;says interesting things,&quot; but Hilda is
            angered when she hears that the oversociable pagan reeve has
            raised doubts in the princess about her forthcoming marriage
            to Christ. Hilda reassures Elfleda, and they sing a Sixth Century
            Latin hymn, &quot;To Thee Before the Close of Day.&quot;</FONT></P>

             SIZE="+1"><BR>
            Alone again, Hilda warms herself into a fine, focused anger at
            Rolf the Reeve. She asks God why he sent her this troublesome
            man who, though he's a good manager, insinuates himself into
            people's personal business and forgets his station. Rolf is far
            too smart for his own good, &quot;though not smart enough to
            see the good of you, Lord.&quot; Then she puts on her cloak and
            goes out into the night to confront the reeve, asking God to
            focus her wrath and sharpen her tongue to meet its target. Rolf
            apologizes for getting too personal with Elfleda, but explains
            that it's not easy for a communicative fellow like himself to
            live with his brother Caedmon, who prefers talking to animals.
            Hilda warns Rolf not to repeat the offense and is preparing to
            leave when she hears another voice, which is Caedmon making up
            a song to welcome a new lamb into the fold. She tells Rolf that
            a gift like his brother's is meant for more than lambs. If Caedmon
            were to sing the stories of the scriptures, she says, he would
            make more lambs for God. After she leaves, warning Rolf again
            to mend his ways or be fired, Rolf confronts Caedmon: If she
            asks you up there to sing, you'd better open your mouth and sing.</FONT></P>

            Hilda and Elfleda are rehearsing for Elfleda's clothing ceremony
            on the morrow, when she will take her first vows as a nun. Elfleda
            confesses that she is uncertain and that she isn't ready to leave
            Hilda. The abbess shores up the girl's doubts and, during their
            duet, Hilda's stronger purpose slowly turns the girl's nostalgic
            lament at leaving the carefree world of a young girl wandering
            the cliffs into a joyful acceptance of her destiny as the future
            abbess. After Elfleda exits, Hilda droops as she realizes that
            tomorrow she will be losing the child who was her closest and
            dearest earthly companion.</FONT></P>

            Some months have gone by. Hilda has sorely missed her lost daughter
            who is now enclosed as a novice. One morning Rolf arrives unexpectedly
            at the monastery, dragging Caedmon. His brother has just had
            a heavenly visitor, he announces to the abbess. He prods the
            unwilling Caedmon to repeat to the abbess what the otherworldly
            voice instructed him to do. Hilda, that wisest of women, understands
            that she is being given a divine gift through her canny reeve.
            She has known God long enough to know He accomplishes His purposes
            through many voices, not all of them issuing from the mouths
            of the deserving or even the truthful. And she is seasoned enough
            in the ways of the world to know exactly how to put these &quot;other
            voices&quot; to work for God's glory. She laughs for the first

            It is the year 680. The Abbess Hilda is now 66 and close to death.
            The abbess has been ill for six years. As Bede, her only know
            biographer* writing within 50 years of her death, when memories
            of her were still fresh, tells us: &quot;It pleased the Author
            of our salvation to try her holy soul by a long sickness, in
            order that her strength might be perfected in weakness.&quot;
            Knowing her time on earth is short, Hilda has sent for Rolf the
            Reeve, who has outlived Caedmon. We learn that Hilda taught Rolf
            to read so that he could &quot;feed&quot; the scriptures to his
            brother,** who was then inspired, as Hilda had foreseen, to make
            songs that reached the hearts of the unconverted. Through giving
            Rolf another voice, that of literacy, the wise abbess has given
            his irrepressible communicative energies a purposeful focus.</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT SIZE="+1">* The Venerable Bede's <I>Ecclesiastical History
            of the English People</I>, was completed in 731 at the monastery
            of Jarrow, 50 miles up the coast from Whitby. In Bede's life
            of St. Cuthbert, he often quotes Cuthbert's special friend, the
            Abbess Elfleda of Whitby, who most likely was also a source for
            what we know about her spiritual mother, Hilda.</FONT></P>

            <P><FONT SIZE="+1">** Bede tells us that Caedmon's superior,
            the reeve, took him before the abbess to report Caedmon's dream
            of a man ordering him to sing in his native tongue about the
            creation of all things. We have made the reeve and the cowherd
            brothers, which is not at all impossible. Bede tells us Caedmon
            later became a brother in the monastery, but he apparently never
            learned to read. According to Bede, Caedmon stored up in his
            memory all that was read to him, &quot;and like and animal chewing
            the cud, turned it into such melodious verse that his delightful
            renderings turned his instructors into his audience.&quot;</FONT></P>
