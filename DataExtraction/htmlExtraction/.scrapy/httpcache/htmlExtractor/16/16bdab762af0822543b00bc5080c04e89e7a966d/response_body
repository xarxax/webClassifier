Clarence Major

They Feared That He Believed
----------------------------

The press boys tried to erase
what he said. Smear it. Change it.
This meant that he no longer
trusted the lies of the times.
Too strong in his manhood.
This meant that reason was no longer reason.
What he said showed them
he did not see the world through
THEIR eyes. This frightened them:
And his death came.
Was not permitted by magic to take;
he was not here long enough
for the final exams- so
no showdown came: because the cops
and the lie still lived.
