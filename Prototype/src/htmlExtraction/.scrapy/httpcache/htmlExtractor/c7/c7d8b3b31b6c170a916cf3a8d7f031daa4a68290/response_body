<P>Jones, Mervyn. A review of <cite>The Amazing Victorian: A Life of George Meredith</cite> (Constable). Says the reviewer, "George Meredith's contemporaries considered him the 19th century's leading literary innovator. His Celtic comic spirit combined with an Anglo-Saxon moral seriousness made Shaw his admirer but rarely his intellectual equal. Only since we've become familiar with the likes of Nabokov and Pynchon can we fully appreciate Meredith as our first great modern novelist."
