<P>

Every once in a while, there is a rather adult piece of Anime that
makes it into the U.S.  <I>Miyuki-chan in Wonderland</I> is certainly
one of these.  It is probably a good thing that Lewis Carol is
dead... even so, he is probably doing aerobics in his grave.

<P>

Miyuki is your typical sailor suit wearing school girl who is almost
always late.  One day while running to school, she falls through a
hole in the sidewalk and ends up in a rather bent Wonderland.  Alice
was never to this side of Wonderland, I am sure.  It seems that this
odd place is populated with <STRONG>lovely young ladies</STRONG> in
various stages of undress playing the various parts of Lewis Carol's
work.  They also seem quite bent on getting Miyuki in like state.

<P>

Mirror land is not much different.

<P>

One does not look for deep thoughts or insight and perhaps the most
amusing thing about <I>Miyuki-chan in Wonderland</I> is that it is
very politically <I>in</I>correct.  One might own it for that reason
alone.
