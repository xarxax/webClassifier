<h3>The manufacturing equipment industry is constantly innovating and the OEMs that provide manufacturing equipment to enable this innovation require agile and innovative partners to support them in creating and delivering new technologies.</h3>
<p>Silcotec Europe&#8217;s skills sets, experience and commitment to exceeding customer expectations make them a natural partner for these OEMs and their Tier 1 suppliers.</p>
<h3>Ann has over twenty years experience at Silcotec Europe in purchasing, logistics and quotations, progressing into business development in 2006, where she was involved in developing and generating new sales leads and opportunities for the company.</h3>
<p>She currently holds the role of Commercial Manager and provides the crucial link between Silcotec Europe and its suppliers, and covers all aspects of purchasing, logistics and customer service. Her particular forte is sourcing innovative solutions across the supply chain to meet customers specific needs. She provides support across the group  in various aspects of purchasing, logistics, customer services and commercial problem solving</p>
<p>Twenty years of procurement experience has given, Anne, as Silcotec Europe’s head of procurement, some fascinating insights about how lean extends through the supply chain.</p>
<p>Often, Lean has been viewed as the domain of the manufacturing floor but this is not the case at Silcotec Europe. Lean principles and practices go beyond the firms centres of manufacturing excellence to all of a its processes, as well as being extended to Procurement and supply management.</p>
<p>Truly Lean Enterprises like Silcotec Europe have gone far beyond the manufacturing floor. At Silcotec Europe Lean is more than just a toolset, but a methodology that extends across the enterprise and represents a way of thinking that when appropriately applied and led by senior management can provide benefits to Procurement, Supply Management and the entire enterprise.</p>
<p>At Silcotec Europe the lean concept reaches right across the enterprise and extends to the keen art and science of procurement. Ann heads up the Silcotec Europe procurement group and as such is at the forefront of their lean procurement programme.</p>
<p>It is clear that 20 years of working with Silcotec Europe suppliers has enabled Ann to develop a well oiled machine around  the procurement discipline. The Silcotec Europe supply chain is its own dynamic ecosystem that is made up of processes, products and companies working together extremely smoothly to adding value to the entire network as they meet their goal of exactly meeting customer requirements in the most cost effective manner.</p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Kevin is the most recent addition to the Silcotec Europe senior management team. Kevin joined the SMT in 2013.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">He brought with him 30 years of mechanical and electronic manufacturing experience across a number of demanding sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">He and his team work not only in delivering on current customers requirements but using their design skills to work with clients to develop mechanical and electronic solutions for new critical technologies.</span></p>
<p>Kevin has a vast and varied career history steeped in the “weird art of interconnection systems”. On leaving school Kevin initially ventured in the world of mechanical engineering, designing and machining a vast array of products and devices but realised that although the design elements was stimulating that mechanical engineering was not going to be for him. In 1982, showing quite some vision for a young man, he took time out to study electronics at college at a time when the electronics course still had a quite a heavy module on valves! This turned out to be a smart career move for the young man Granger as on graduation he found that highly skilled electronics engineers were in high demand.</p>
<p>Kevin soon made quite a name for himself with his ability to solve interconnection problems and find practical ,pragmatic and durable solutions for products in which interconnections played a critical role.</p>
<p>Kevin still gets a huge thrill from solving a design challenge</p>
<p>Kevin definitely enjoys the trend toward more vertical integration between supplier and customer. It is fair to say that Silcotec Europe are far more likely to be involved in the prototype and design stages of new products with their client partners than they ever have been before. At Silcotec Europe our outlook and philosophy is very much ‘our team , is your team’ and this makes for a very rewarding, high value relationship for experienced hands like Kevin.</p>
<h3>Enda celebrates his coming of age at Silcotec Europe this year &#8211; 21 years with the business. Enda joined the business in 1992 as an Electronic Engineering Graduate.</h3>
<p>During his career he has occupied quality, engineering, project management and sales roles. Enda has an intimate knowledge of the business, its capabilities, methodologies, culture and philosophy.</p>
<p>Enda works closely with customers at all stages of the commercial relationship to ensure the smoothest transition into the Silcotec Europe outsourced model and building an ongoing seamless relationship. His role involves supporting customers and the Silcotec Operations teams in building a seamless connection between customers and Silcotec Europe.</p>
<p>His breadth of experience is crucial to his role in ensuring the provision of high impact value adds for customers. Having held significant roles as a Quality Engineer; leading the business’s engineering group; building and developing quotations and costings and working with World Class OEMs for many years he has given him a deep, practical understanding of customer requirements. This real world experience provides him with a vast library of potential solutions and fixes for clients’ challenges.</p>
<p>In a world where there is now a far more nuanced and sophisticated approach to procurement and outsourcing Enda’s experience and skill sets pay dividends for both Silcotec and its clients. With many companies now looking toward forging strong Value Added Relationships when selecting outsourced partners rather than just a “cost-down” approach to procurement, clearly you need to have value to add. With a multi-disciplinary background comes a whole bundle of insights and clarity of vision in active problem solving that brings outside the box thinking to the most complex technical design and electrical engineering challenges.</p>
