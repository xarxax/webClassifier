<h2><center>John Peale Bishop, "A Recollection"</h2>
<b>written sometime in the mid-1920s</b></center>

<blockquote>
Famously she descended, her red hair<br>
Unbound and bronzed by sea-reflections, caught<br>
Crinkled with sea-pearls. The fine slender taut<br>
Knees that let down her feet upon the air,<p>

Young breasts, slim flanks and golden quarries were<br>
Odder than when the young distraught<br>
Unknown Venetian, painting her portrait, thought<br>
He'd not imagined what he painted there.<p>

And I too commerced with that golden cloud:<br>
Lipped her delicious hands and had my ease<br>
Faring fantastically, perversely proud.<p>

All loveliness demands our courtesies.<br>
Since she was dead I praised her as I could<br>
Silently, among the Barberini bees.<p>
