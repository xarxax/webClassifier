Tower<br>from The Worm Ouroboros, by E. R.

<P></P><P><p>

It was now gathering dusk,<BR>
and  weak  twilight  only  entered  through  the  deep<BR>
embrasures  of  the  windows  that  pierced  the  walls<BR>
of the  tower,  looking  to  the  four  quarters  of the<BR>
heavens. A furnace glowing in the big hearth threw<BR>
fitful gleams into the recesses of the chamber, lighting<BR>
up strange  shapes  of  glass  and  earthenware,  flasks<BR>
and retorts, balances, hour-glasses, crucibles and as-<BR>
trolabes, a monstrous three-necked alembic of phos-<BR>
phorescent  glass  supported  on  a  bain-marie,  and<BR>
other  instruments  of  doubtful  and  unlawful  aspect.<p>

Under the northern window over against the  door-<BR>
way was a massive table blackened with age, whereon<BR>
lay  great  books  bound  in  black  leather  with  iron<BR>
guards and heavy padlocks. And in a mighty chair<BR>
beside this table was King Gorice XII., robed in his<BR>
conjuring robe of black and gold,  resting his cheek<BR>
on his hand that was lean as an eagle's claw. The<BR>
low light, mother of shade and secrecy, that hovered<BR>
in that chamber moved about the still figurc of the<BR>
King, his nose hooked as an eagle's beak, his cropped<BR>
hair, his thick close-cut beard and shaven upper lip,<BR>
his high cheek-bones and cruel heavy jaw, and the<BR>
dark eaves of his  brows whence  the glint of green<BR>
eyes showed as no friendly lamp to them without. The<BR>
door shut noiselessly, and Gro stood before the King.<p>

The  dusk  deepened,  and  the  firelight  puIsed  and<BR>
blinked in that dread chamber, and the King leaned<BR>
without  motion  on  his  hand,  bending  his  brow  on<BR>
Gro; and there was utter silence save for the faint<BR>
purr of the furnace.<p>

    In a while the King said, "I sent for thee, because<BR>
thou alone wast so hardy as to urge to the uttermost<BR>
thy counsel upon the King that is now dead, Gorice<BR>
XI. of memory ever glorious. And because thy coun-<BR>
sel was good. Marvellest thou that I wist of thy counsel?"<BR>
Gro said, "O my Lord the King, I marvel not......."<p>

 [And Gorice said] ["I bethink me of]<BR>
 Gorice X., victorious in single combats<BR>
 without number, [who] made our name glorious over all the<BR>
 world.  Yet at the last he gat his death,  out of all<BR>
 expectation and by what treacherous sleight I know not,<BR>
 standing in single combat against the curled step-dancer<BR>
 from Krothering. But I, that am skilled in grammarie,<BR>
 do bear a mightier engine against the Demons than<BR>
 brawny sinews or the sword that smiteth asunder. Yet<BR>
 is mine engine perilous to him that useth it."<p>

 Therewith the King unlocked the greatest of those<BR>
 books that lay by on the massive table, saying in Gro's<BR>
 ear, as one who would not be overheard, "This is that<BR>
 awful book of grammarie wherewith in this same cham-<BR>
 ber, on such a night, Gorice VII. stirred the vasty deep.<BR>
 And know that from this circumstance alone ensued the<BR>
 ruin of King Gorice VII., in that, having by his hellish<BR>
 science conjured up somewhat from the primaeval dark,<BR>
 and being utterly fordone with the sweat and stress of<BR>
 his conjuring, his mind was clouded for a moment, in<BR>
 such sort that either he forgot the words writ in this<BR>
 grammarie, or the page whereon they were writ,  or<BR>
 speech failed him to speak those words that must be<BR>
 spoken, or might to do those things which must be done<BR>
 to complete the charm. Wherefore he kept not his pow-<BR>
 er over that which he had called out of the deep, but it<BR>
 turned upon him and tare him limb from limb. Such like<BR>
 doom will I avoid, renewing in these latter days those<BR>
 self-same spells, if thou durst stand by me undismayed<BR>
 the while I utter my incantations. And shouldst thou<BR>
 mark me fail or waver ere all be accomplished, then<BR>
 shalt thyself lay hand on book and crucible and fulfill<BR>
whatsoever is needful, as I shall first show thee. Or<BR>
quailest thou at this?"<p>

 Gro said, "Lord, show me my task. And I will carry<BR>
 it, though all the Furies of the pit flock to this chamber<BR>
 to say me nay."<p>

 So the King instructed Gro, rehearsing to him those<BR>
 acts that were needful, and making known unto him the<BR>
 divers pages of the grammarie whereon were writ those<p>


  words which must be spoken each in its due time and se-<BR>
  quence. But the King pronounced not yet those words,<BR>
  pointing only to them in the book, for whoso speaketh<BR>
  those words in vain and out of season is lost. And now<BR>
  when the retorts and beakers with their several necks<BR>
  and tubes and the appurtenances thereof were set in<BR>
  order, and the unhallowed processes of fixation, conjunc-<BR>
  tion, deflagration, putrefaction,  and rubefication were<BR>
  nearing maturity, and the baleful star Antares standing<BR>
  by the astrolabe within a little of the meridian signified<BR>
  the instant approach of midnight, the King described on<BR>
  the floor with his conjuring rod three pentacles inclosed<BR>
  within a seven-pointed star, with the signs of Cancer and<BR>
  of Scorpio joined by certain runes. And in the midst of<BR>
  the star he limned the image of a green crab eating of the<BR>
  sun. And turning to the seventy-third page of his great<BR>
  black grammarie the King recited in a mighty voice words<BR>
  o[ hidden meaning, calling on the name that it is a sin<BR>
  to utter.<p>

  Now when he had spoken the first spell and was si-<BR>
  lent, there was a deadly quiet in that chamber, and a<BR>
  chill in the air as of winter. And in the quiet Gro heard<BR>
  the King's breath coming and going, as of one who hath<BR>
  rowed a course. Now the blood rushed back to Gro's<BR>
  heart and his hands and feet became cold and a cold<BR>
  sweat brake forth on his brow. But for all that, he held<BR>
  yet his courage firm and his brain ready. The King mo-<BR>
  tioned to Gro to break off the tail of a certain drop of<BR>
  black glass that lay on the table; and with the snapping<BR>
  of its tail the whole drop fell in pieces in a coarse<BR>
  black powder. Gro by the King's direction gathered that<BR>
  powder and dropped it in the great alembic wherein a<BR>
  green fluid seethed and bubbled above the flame of a<BR>
  lamp; and the fluid became red as blood, and the body<BR>
  of the alembic filled with a tawny smoke, and sparks<BR>
  of sun-like brilliance flashed and crackled through the<BR>
  smoke.  Thereupon distilled from the neck of the alembic<BR>
  a white oil incombustible, and the King dipped his rod in<BR>
  that oil and described round the seven-pointed star on<BR>
  the floor the figure of the worm Ouroboros, that eateth<BR>
  his own tail.. And he wrote the formula of the crab below<BR>
  the circle, and spake his second spell.<p>

 When that was done, yet more biting seemed the night<BR>
  air and yet more like the grave the stillness of the cham-<BR>
  ber. The King's hand shook as with an ague as he turned<BR>
  the pages of the mighty book. Gro's teeth chattered in his<BR>
  head. He gritted them together and waited. And now<BR>
  through every window came a light into the chamber as<BR>
  of skies paling to the dawn. Yet not wholly so; for never<BR>
  yet came dawn at midnight, nor from all four quarters<BR>
  of the sky at once, nor with such swift strides of in-<BR>
  creasing light, nor with a light so ghastly. The candle<BR>
  flames burned filmy as the glare waxed strong from<BR>
  without:  an evil pallid light of bale and corruption,<BR>
  wherein the hands and faces of the King Gorice and his<BR>
  disciple showed death-pale, and their lips black as the<BR>
  dark skin of a grape where the bloom has been rubbed<BR>
  off from it. The King cried terribly, "The hour approach-<BR>
  eth!" And he took a phial of crystal containing a de-<BR>
  coction of wolf's jelly and  salamander's blood,  and<BR>
dropped seven drops from the alembic into the phial and<BR>
poured forth that liquor on the figure of the crab drawn<BR>
on the floor. Gro leaned against the wail, weak in body<BR>
but with will unbowed. So bitter was the cold that his<BR>
hands and feet were benumbed, and the liquor from the<BR>
phial congealed where it fell. Yet the sweat stood in<BR>
beads on the forehead of the King by reason o[ the mighty<BR>
striving that was his, and in the overpowering glare of<BR>
that light from the underskies he stood stiff and erect,<BR>
hands clenched and arms outstretched, and spake the<BR>
words LURO  VOPO  VIR  VOARCHADUMIA.<p>

Now with those words spoken the vivid light departed<BR>
as a blown-out lamp, and the midnight closed down<BR>
again without. Nor was any sound heard save the thick<BR>
panting of the King; but it was as if the night held its<BR>
breath in expectation of that which was to come. And the<BR>
candles sputtered and burned blue. The King swayed and<BR>
clutched the table with his left hand; and again the King<BR>
pronounced terribly the word VOARCHADUMIA.<p>

Thereafter for the space of ten heart-beats silence<BR>
hung like a kestrel poised in the listening night. Then went<BR>
a crash through earth and heaven, and a blinding wild-<BR>
fire through the chamber as it had been a thunderbolt.<BR>
All Carce quaked, and the chamber was filled with<BR>
a beating of wings, like the wings of some monstrous<BR>
bird. The air that was wintry cold waxed on a sudden<BR>
hot as the breath of a burning mountain, and Gro was<BR>
near choking with the smell of soot and the smell of<BR>
brimstone. And the chamber rocked as a ship riding in a<BR>
swell with the wind against the tide. But the King, steady-<BR>
ing himself against the table and clutching the edge of it<BR>
till the veins on his lean hand seemed nigh to bursting,<BR>
cried in short breaths and with an altered voice, "By<BR>
these figures drawn and by these spells enchanted, by the<BR>
unction of wolf and salamander, by the unblest sign of<BR>
Cancer now leaning to the sun, and by the fiery heart of<BR>
Scorpio that flameth in this hour on night's meridian,<BR>
thou art my thrall and instrument.  Abase thee and<BR>
serve me, worm of the pit. Else will I by and by<BR>
summon out of ancient night intelligences and domina-<BR>
tions mightier far than thou, and they shall serve mine<BR>
ends, and thee shall they chain with chains of quench-<BR>
less fire and drag thee from torment to torment through<BR>
the deep."<p>

Therewith the earthquake was stilled, and there re-<BR>
mained but a quivering of the walls and floor and the<BR>
wind of those unseen wings and the hot smell of soot and<BR>
brimstone burning. And speech came out of the teeming<BR>
air of that chamber, strangely sweet, saying, "Accursed<BR>
wretch that troublest our quiet, what is thy will'?" The<BR>
terror of that speech made the throat of Gro dry, and the<BR>
hairs on his scalp stood up.<p>

The King trembled in all his members like a fright-<BR>
encd horse, yet was his voice level and his coun-<BR>
tenance unruffled as he said hoarsely, "Mine enemies<BR>
sail at day-break from the Foliot Isles.  I loose thee<BR>
against them as a falcon from my wrist.   I give thee<BR>
them. Turn them to thy will: how or where it skills not,<BR>
so thou do but break and destroy them off the face of<BR>
the world. Away!"<p>

But now was the King's endurance clean spent, so that<BR>
his knees failed him and he sank like a sick man into his<BR>
mighty chair. But the room was filled with a tumult as of<BR>
rushing waters, and a laughter above the tumult like<BR>
to the laughter of souls condemned. And the King was re-<BR>
minded that he had left unspoken that word which should<BR>
dismiss his sending. But to such weariness was he now<BR>
come and so utterly was his strength gone out from him<BR>
in the exercise of his spells, that his tongue clave to the<BR>
roof of his mouth, so that he might not speak the word;<BR>
and horribly he rolled up the whites of his eyes beckon-<BR>
ing to Gro, the while his nerveless fingers sought to turn<BR>
the heavy pages of the grammarie. Then sprang Gro forth<BR>
to the table, and against it sprawling, for now was the<BR>
great keep of Carce shaken anew as one shaketh a dice<BR>
box, and lightnings opened the heavens, and the thun-<BR>
der roared unceasingly, and the sound of waters stunned<BR>
the ear in that chamber, and still that laughter pealed<BR>
above the turmoil. And Gro knew that it was now with<BR>
the King even as it had been with Gorice VII in years<BR>
gone by, when his strength gave forth and the spirit<BR>
tare him and plastered those chamber-walls with his<BR>
blood. Yet was Gro mindful, even in that hideous storm<BR>
of terror, of the ninety-seventh page whereon the King<BR>
had shown him the word of dismissal, and he wrenched<BR>
the book from the King's palsied grasp and turned to<BR>
the page. Scarce had his eye found the word, when a<BR>
whirlwind of hail and sleet swept into the chamber, and<BR>
the candles were blown out and the tables overset. And<BR>
in the plunging darkness beneath the crashing of the<BR>
thunder Gro pitching headlong felt claws clasp his head<BR>
and body. He cried in his agony the word, that was the<BR>
word TRIPSARECOPSEM, and so fell a-swooning.<p>

It was high noon when the Lord Gro came to his<BR>
senses  in that chamber.  The strong spring sunshine<BR>
poured through the southern window, lighting up the<BR>
wreckage of the night. The tables were cast down and<BR>
the floor strewn and splashed with costly essences and<BR>
earths spilt from shattered phials and jars and caskets:<BR>
aphroselmia, shell of gold, saffron of gold, asem, amianth,<BR>
stypteria of Melos, confounded with mandragora, vinum<BR>
ardens, sal armoniack, devouring aqua regia, little pools<BR>
and scattered globules of quicksilver, poisonous decoc-<BR>
tions  of  toadstools  and  of  yewberries,  monkshood,<BR>
thorn-apple, wolf's bane and black hellebore, quintessences<BR>
of dragon's blood and serpent's bile; and with these,<BR>
splashed together and wasted, elixirs that wise men have<BR>
died a-dreaming of: spiritus mundi, and that sovereign<BR>
alkahest which dissolveth every substance dipped therein,<BR>
and that aurum potabile which being itself perfect in-<BR>
duceth perfection in the living frame. And in this welter<BR>
of spoiled treasure were the great conjuring books hurled<BR>
amid the ruin of retorts and aludels of glass and lead<BR>
and silver, sand-baths, matrasses, spatulae, athanors, and<BR>
other instruments innumerable of rare design, tossed<BR>
and broken on the chamber floor. The King's chair was<BR>
thrown against the furnace, and huddled against the table<BR>
lay the King, his head thrown back, his black beard<BR>
pointing skyward, showing his sinewy hairy throat. Gro<BR>
looked narrowly at him; saw that he seemed unhurt and<BR>
slept deep; and so, knowing well that sleep is a present<BR>
remedy for every ill, watched by the King in silence all<BR>
day till supper time, for all he was sore an-hungered.<p>

When at length the King awoke, he looked about him<BR>
in amaze. "Methought I tripped at the last step of last<BR>
night's journey," he said.  "And truly strange riot hath<BR>
left its footprints in my chamber."<p>

Gro answered, "Lord, sorely was I tried; yet fulfilled I<BR>
your behest."<p>

The King laughed as one whose soul is at ease, and<BR>
standing upon his feet said unto Gro, "Take up the crown<BR>
of Witchland and crown me. And that high honour shalt<BR>
thou have, because I do love thee for this night gone by."<p class="auto-style1">
