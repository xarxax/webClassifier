For all those beaten, for the broken heads,<BR>
The fosterless, the simple, the oppressed,<BR>
The ghosts in the burning city of our time…
<BR><BR>
For those taken in rapid cars to the house and beaten<BR>
By the skillful boys with the rubber fists,<BR>
-Held down and beaten, the table cutting the loins<BR>
Or kicked in the groin and left, with the muscles jerking<BR>
Like a headless hen's on the floor of the slaughter-house<BR>
While they brought the next man in with his white eyes staring.<BR>
For those who still said "Red Front" or "God save the Crown!"<BR>
And for those who were not courageous<BR>
But were beaten nevertheless.<BR>
For those who spit out the bloody stumps of their teeth<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quietly in the hall,<BR>
Sleep well on stone or iron, watch for the time<BR>
And kill the guard in the privy before they die,<BR>
Those with the deep-socketed eyes and the lamp burning.
<BR><BR>
For those who carry the scars, who walk lame - for those<BR>
Whose nameless graves are made in the prison-yard<BR>
And the earth smoothed back before the morning and the lime scattered.
<BR><BR>
For those slain at once.<BR>
For those living through the months and years<BR>
Enduring, watching, hoping, going each day<BR>
To the work or the queue for meat or the secret club,<BR>
Living meanwhile, begetting children, smuggling guns,<BR>
And found and killed at the end like rats in a drain.
<BR><BR>
For those escaping<BR>
Incredibly into exile and wandering there.<BR>
For those who live in the small rooms of foreign cities<BR>
And who yet think of the country, the long green grass,<BR>
The childhood voices, the language, the way wind smelt then,<BR>
The shape of rooms, the coffee drunk at the table,<BR>
The talk with friends, the loved city, the waiter's face,<BR>
The gravestones, with the name, where they will not lie<BR>
Nor in any of that earth.<BR>
Their children are strangers.
<BR><BR>
For those who planned and were leaders and were beaten<BR>
And for those, humble and stupid, who had no plan<BR>
But were denounced, but were angry, but told a joke,<BR>
But could not explain, but were sent away to the camp,<BR>
But had their bodies shipped back in the sealed coffins,<BR>
"Died of pneumonia." "Died trying to escape."
<BR><BR>
For those growers of wheat who were shot by their own wheat-stacks,<BR>
For those growers of bread who were sent to the ice-locked wastes.<BR>
And their flesh remembers the fields.
<BR><BR>
For those denounced by their smug, horrible children<BR>
For a peppermint-star and the praise of the Perfect State,<BR>
For all those strangled, gelded or merely starved<BR>
To make perfect states; for the priest hanged in his cassock,<BR>
The Jew with his chest crushed in and his eyes dying,<BR>
The revolutionist lynched by the private guards<BR>
To make perfect states, in the names of the perfect states.
<BR><BR>
For those betrayed by the neigbours they shook hands with<BR>
And for the traitors, sitting in the hard chair<BR>
With the loose sweat crawling their hair and their fingers restless<BR>
As they tell the street and the house and the man's name.<BR>
And for those sitting at the table in the house<BR>
With the lamp lit and the plates and the smell of food,<BR>
Talking so quietly; when they hear the cars<BR>
And the knock at the door, and they look at each other quickly<BR>
And the woman goes to the door with a stiff face,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoothing her dress.<BR>
"We are all good citizens here. We believe in the Perfect State."
<BR><BR>
And that was the last time Tony or Karl or Shorty came to the house<BR>
And the family was liquidated later.<BR>
It was the last time.<BR>
We heard the shots in the night<BR>
But nobody knew next day what the trouble was<BR>
And a man must go to his work.<BR>
So I didn't see him<BR>
For three days, then, and me near out of my mind<BR>
And all the patrols on the streets with their dirty guns<BR>
And when he came back, he looked drunk, and the blood was on him.
<BR><BR>
For the women who mourn their dead in the secret night,<BR>
For the children taught to keep quiet, the old children,<BR>
The children spat-on at school.<BR>
For the wrecked laboratory,<BR>
The gutted house, the dunged picture, the pissed-in well<BR>
The naked corpse of Knowledge flung in the square<BR>
And no man lifting a hand and no man speaking.
<BR><BR>
For the cold of the pistol-butt and the bullet's heat,<BR>
For the ropes that choke, the manacles that bind,<BR>
The huge voice, metal, that lies from a thousand tubes<BR>
And the stuttering machine-gun that answers all.
<BR><BR>
For the man crucified on the crossed machine guns<BR>
Without name, without ressurection, without stars,<BR>
His dark head heavy with death and his flesh long sour<BR>
With the smell of his many prisons - John Smith, John Doe,<BR>
John Nobody - oh, crack your mind for his name!<BR>
Faceless as water, naked as the dust,<BR>
Dishonored as the earth the gas-shells poison<BR>
And barbarous with portent.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is he.<BR>
This is the man they ate at the green table<BR>
Putting their gloves on ere they touched the meat.<BR>
This is the fruit of war, the fruit of peace,<BR>
The ripeness of invention, the new lamb,<BR>
The answer to the wisdom of the wise.<BR>
And still he hangs, and still he will not die<BR>
And still, on the steel city of our years<BR>
The light falls and the terrible blood streams down.
<BR><BR>
We thought we were done with these things but we were wrong.<BR>
We thought, because we had power, we had wisdom.<BR>
We thought the long train would run to the end of Time.<BR>
We thought the light would increase.<BR>
Now the long train stands derailed and the bandits loot it.<BR>
Now the boar and the asp have power in our time.<BR>
Now the night rolls back on the West and the night is solid.<BR>
Our fathers and ourselves sowed dragon's teeth.
<BR><BR>
Our children know and suffer the armed men.
