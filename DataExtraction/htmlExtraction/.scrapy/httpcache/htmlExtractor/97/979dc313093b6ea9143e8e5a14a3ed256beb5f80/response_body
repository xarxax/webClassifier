<h1>"The Deep Pit"--a review of Ralph Ellison's <i>Invisible Man</i></h1>

<h2> by Lloyd 
Brown</h2> 

<b>in <i>Masses & Mainstream</i> (vol. 5, no. 6 [June 1952])</b>

<p>
"Whence all this passion toward conformity?" asks Ralph Ellison at the end 
of his novel, <i>Invisible Man</i>. He should know, because his whole book 
conforms exactly to the formula for literary success in today's market. 
Despite the murkiness of his avant-garde symbolism, the pattern is clear 
and may be charted as precisely as a publisher's quarterly sales report. <p>

Chapter 1: A 12-page scene of sadism (a command performance of 10 Negro 
youths savagely beating; each other for the Bourbons reward of scattered 
coins), sex (a dance by a naked whore with a small American flag tattooed 
upon her belly), and shock (literally applied to the performers by an 
electrically charged rug) . <p>

Chapter 2: Featuring a 14-page scene in which a poor Negro farmer tells a 
white millionaire in great detail how he committed incest with his 
daughter; and the millionaire, who burns to do the same to his own
daughter, rewards the narrator with a hundred-dollar bill. <p>

And so on, to the central design of American Century literature 
anti-Communism. <p>

Author Ellison will reap more than scattered change or a 
crumpled bill for his performance. <i>Invisible</i> Man is already 
visible on 
the best-seller lists. The quivering excitement of the commercial 
reviewers matches that of the panting millionaire. <p>

Strangely, there is much truth in their shouts of acclaim: "It is a 
sensational and feverishly emotional book. It will shock and sicken some 
readers . . . the hero is a symbol of doubt, perplexity, betrayal and 
defeat . . . tough, brutal and [again] sensational," says Orville 
Prescott in the <i>New York Times</i> about "the most impressive work of 
filction by an American Negro which I have ever read." <p>

"Here," writes Daniel James in the war-mongering <i>New Leader</i>, "the 
author establishes, in new terms, the commonness of every human's fate: 
nothingness." <p>

"Authentic air of unreality," exults the reviewer in the <i>Sunday 
Times</i>, 
about the part dealing with the "Brotherhood" (Ellison's euphemism for 
the Communist Party). <p>

The Sunday New York Herald Tribune man knows what he likes  too: <p>
<blockquote>
"For a grand finale theres the hot, dry August night of the big riot when 
the hungry looted, when Ras the destroyer of white appeasersalone was out 
for blood; when Sybil, the chestnut-haired nymphomaniac, was raped by 
Santa Claus and when the Invisible Man, still clutching his briefease, 
fell through an open grill into a coal cellarand stayed there to write a 
book...." <p>
</blockquote>
<i>The Saturday Review of Literature</i> is also impressed with this work 
that is as "'unreal' as a surrealist painting. . . . It is unlikely that 
<i>Invisible Man</i> is intended to be a realistic novel, although the 
detail is as teal as the peeling paint on an old house." <p>

At this point a reviewer <i>in M&amp;M</i> might very well say "Amen!" and 
leave the 
unpleasant subject. But the commercial claque does more than extol 
Ellison's "surrealist horror," "well-ordered dissonance," 
"Dostoyevskianism," and thrill to "Harlem's slough of despond." We see 
that the same <i>Saturday Review</i> critic who is happily certain that 
this is 
not a realistic novel insists that "<i>. . . here, for the first time, is 
the whole truth about the Negro in America</i>." <p>

The mind reels before a statement such as that, compounded as it is of an 
ignorance so stupendous that it can only be matched by its arrogance. <p>

Ostensibly set in Negro life, the novel is profoundly anti-Negro and it 
is this quality which moved several of the chauvinist critics to say that 
its author has "transcended race" and "writes as well as a white man" the 
highest accolade they can bestow! <p>

Here, as in James Jones' whine <i>From Here to Eternity</i>, is the 
one-man-against-the-world theme, a theme which cannot tell the "whole 
truth" or any part of the truth about the Negro people in America or 
about any other people anywhere. <p>

Ellison's narrator-hero is a shadowy concept, lacking even the 
identity of a name, who tells of his Odyssey through a Negro college in 
the South, then to Harlem where he is hired by the Communists as their 
mass leader ("How would you like to be the new Booker T. Washington?'') 
for $300 cash advance and the munificent, depression-period pay of $60 
per week; he is quickly disillusioned and, battered in body and soul, 
finds refuge down a man-hole from whence to write a book about it all. <p>

It would not be in order here to speak of responsibility, for the 
writer has anticipated and answered that objection in the prologue: "I 
can hear you say, 'What a horrible, irresponsible bastard!' And you're 
right. I leap to agree with you. I am one of the most irresponsible 
beings that ever lived." <p>

Nor will I here attempt to refute the particular variations of the 
antiCommunist lie that Ellison tells. Some idea of his writing on this 
subject can be gained when we see even the <i>New Leader</i>, second to 
none in 
Redbaiting viciousness, complaining that "Ellison's Communists are hard 
to believe, they are so unrelievedly humorless, cynical and degenerate 
(including the black Communists)." And the Nation's reviewerwho says he 
is "ready to believe" the worst about "Harlem Stalinists"grumbles: "The 
trouble with such caricature is that it undermines the intention behind 
it." (Nevertheless he finds the book "exalted." ) <p>

And just as thc author makes his irresponsibility undebatable, so 
does he help establish the fact that his work is alien to the Negro 
people and has its source in upper-class corruption. According to an 
interview in the Saturday Review it was "T. S. Eliot's 'The Wasteland' 
which . . changed the direction of his life:  'Eliot said something to my 
sensibilities that I couldn't find in Negro poets who wrote of 
experiences I myself had gone through.'" <p>

Indeed, there is nothing in common between the wailing eunuchs of 
decay on the one hand, and the passionate strength and beauty of Negro 
poetry on the other. One can only speculate as to what it was in 
Ellison's "sensibilities" that drew him to Eliot and away from his 
peopleand away from all people. But the result of the infection is a 
tragedy: the firstborn of a talented young Negro writer enters the world 
with no other life than its maggots. <p>

Ellison is also a disciple of the Richard Wright-Chester Himes 
school and shares with these writers their bitter alienation from the 
Negro people, their hatred and contempt of the Negro working masses, 
their renegades' malice and their servility to the masters. Cut of from 
the surging mainstream of Negro life and struggle and creativity, they 
stagnate in Paris, wander on lonely crusades, or spit out at the world 
from a hole in the ground. <p>

But against them and their inspirers is the growing renaissance of 
the Negro people's culturewriters, playwrights, poets, singers, 
musicians, dancers, artists and actors, who are linked with their people, 
who love their people and who sing with the Negro poet of long ago: 
<i>"Lord, I don't want to be like Judas 
In my heart.... </i><p>
