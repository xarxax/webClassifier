<center><h3>CJD blood products <A NAME="given">given</A> to 3,000 patients</h3>
</center>
<PRE>December 16 1997  BY AUDREY MAGEE AND IAN MURRAY </PRE>
 UP TO<FONT COLOR="#990099"> 3,000 people treated in 100 British hospitals</FONT> may have been
  injected with blood products taken from a donor who died six weeks ago
  from new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human form of BSE. 

  <FONT COLOR="#990099">None of them is to be told</FONT> because the Health Department believes the
  risk of them developing the disease is so slight that there is no reason to
  cause alarm. 
<P>
  Although hospitals have been advised to return the product, used in
  X-ray screenings to detect lung disease, so far only 15 per cent has
  been recovered. 

  <FONT COLOR="#990099">There is no order obliging hospitals to return it</FONT> and some clinicians
 <FONT COLOR="#990099"> may go on using up stocks</FONT> on the basis that patients are far more likely
  to die from infections or cancer that can be diagnosed with the product
  than from CJD. 
<P>
  Another 268 patients in Ireland are known to have been given
  injections from the same batch of the product. The Irish Health
  Ministry has decided to notify all the patients concerned. 
<P>
  Even though the identity of all those who have been given an injection of
  the product is known, it was decided not to tell them because there is no
  evidence that the illness can be transmitted through the blood or the
  serum derived from it to make the product and the risk of developing
  CJD is regarded as negligible. 

<BLOCKQUOTE>  "You are putting an enormous burden on people by telling them they
  have a remote risk of contracting the disease," the department said last
  night. "The ethics committee which advises us on these matters decided
  it was <FONT COLOR="#990099">just not appropriate to tell them</FONT>."</BLOCKQUOTE> 

  The blood from the donor was sent 18 months ago to the National Blood
  Authority laboratory, where it was split into a number of different
  products. <FONT COLOR="#990099">The donor's plasma was mixed with some taken from 49,000
  other donors to make 8,174 bottles of albumin</FONT>, the water-soluble
  protein found in blood. 
<P>
 <FONT COLOR="#990099"> Many were exported</FONT> but 210 of the 50ml bottles remained in Britain
  and were sent to eight different hospitals and companies. Some of the
  bottles were used intravenously to rehydrate burn victims. 
<P>
  One bottle was sent to Nycomed Amersham which used it to produce
  14,000 vials of Amerscan Pulmonate II, an agent which is injected into
  the lungs so that infections and cancer show up under X-ray. The
  company sent almost 3,700 vials to 100 British hospitals. 
<P>
  At the end of October the European Committee on Proprietary Medicinal
  Products called for the withdrawal of blood products derived from
  donors who were confirmed CJD cases. On November 1 the Blood
  Transfusion Service was notified that one of its donors had died from the
  disease so the Amersham company was told. 
<P>
  In turn the company got in touch with the Medicines Control Agency
  which informed the Health Department and it recommended withdrawal
  of the product on November 17. 
<P>
    Despite regular alarms, there has never been any convincing evidence
  that blood or blood products can transmit CJD (Nigel Hawkes writes).
  Unless new variant CJD, the human form of "mad cow" disease, is more
  easily transmitted than classic CJD via blood or blood products, there
  does not appear to be any cause for concern.  [This is no medical basis for this statement -- webmaster]
<P>
  For classic CJD the risk seems negligible. About 50 people a year die of
  the disease, so it is certain that every year some of them give blood
  after they have the infection but before its symptoms appear. Studies
  show that classic CJD can be passed on in human tissue, but not - so far
  as we know - in blood. [This is not an accurate summary of current scientific knowledge -- webmaster]

<center><h3> <a NAME="bin">Downing Street rib joint ends in bin</a></h3>
</center><PRE>December 16 1997  BY ADRIAN LEE</PRE> 
           <B>Farewell Dinner for the Roast Beef of Olde England </B>

  A 15lb rib of beef was delivered to 10 Downing Street yesterday - and
  was destined to go straight into the dustbin.   The joint was taken to the doors of No 10 in protest at the ban on the
  sale of beef on the bone, which took effect at midnight. The National
  Cattle Association said it wanted the Prime Minister to experience the
  "excellence of the product" first-hand, and presented it to a policeman. 
<P>
  It was taken inside, but a Downing Street spokesman said that it would
  be thrown away, in line with government advice that it was not safe to
  eat. <BLOCKQUOTE>"Obviously this is part of a publicity campaign by farmers and they
  are perfectly entitled to make their case. But clearly the beef on the
  bone cannot be eaten and <FONT COLOR="#990099">it will be disposed of</FONT>."</BLOCKQUOTE> 

  The demonstration outside No 10 was one of a series of protests and
  rallies opposing the ban, while customers were rushing to buy T-bone
  steaks, ribs and oxtails before the midnight deadline.  And last night pubs and restaurants held defiant farewell celebrations to
  traditional favourites. At Butchers' Hall, near Smithfield meat market,
  <FONT COLOR="#990099">fifty guests of the City caterers Chester Boyd feasted on oxtail soup</FONT> and
  baron of beef washed down with bullshot, a drink made from vodka and
  beef consommª. 
<P>
  At Westminster, butchers in working aprons paraded with a forerib of
  beef outside the House of Commons and presented the Conservative MP
  Bill Cash with a petition signed by 106,000 members of the public
  requesting that they be allowed to make up their own minds. <blockquote> "To get so
  many signatures in just four days shows that the public is
  overwhelmingly against this ban, which was a kneejerk, panic
  measure," Mr Cash said. "The British public <font COLOR="#990099">do not want a nanny state</font>
  telling them what to eat." </blockquote>

  Trading standards officers have also written to the Government
  complaining that the new law is confusing and could be impossible to
  enforce, and a black market is expected to flourish. 

  Gordon Gresty, head of trading standards in North Yorkshire, expected
  butchers with regular customers in small communities to flout the ban.
<BLOCKQUOTE>  "It is going to be extremely difficult to police. I am certain we will see
  under-the-counter deals which will be virtually impossible to stop." </BLOCKQUOTE>

  Bob Dove, a butchers in Battersea, southwest London, also believed that
  a black market might thrive, but said: "I suspect the Government will
  soon stop us buying beef on the bone if they suspect butchers of
  breaking the law." That would play into the hands of the supermarkets
  and send scores of independent butchers under. 
<P>
  Both Mr Dove and Danny Hepburn, a butcher from Mountnessing, Essex,
  reported that customers had been stockpiling beef. Mr Hepburn said:
  "They are disgusted by this. One man came in at the weekend and filled
  his boot with foreribs and oxtail. I have sold more oxtails in the last
  week than I would normally sell in a year." 
<P>
  By last night, however, most restaurants had reluctantly removed beef
  on the bone from their menus. Michel Bourdin, head chef at the
  Connaught Grill in London, said he felt like committing suicide, but
  added: "I will adapt, what can I do? I don't want to go to jail for trying to
  save British gastronomy."

     <center><h3><A NAME="Retaliation">Retaliation</A>: Britain puts health ban on EU  beef</h3>
</center>December 16 1997  Times BY CHARLES BREMNER, PHILIP WEBSTER AND MICHAEL HORNSBY 

     
  BRITAIN plunged into a new confrontation with Europe over beef
  yesterday when Jack Cunningham imposed a <FONT COLOR="#990099">unilateral ban on imports</FONT>
  that do not meet the safety standards required of British meat. 

  The Agriculture Minister announced his decision after the EU voted
  14-1 to delay the introduction of such checks throughout the
  Community until next April. 
<P>
  In language reminiscent of John Major's "beef war" in the summer of
  1996, he attacked "fraudulent" arguments being put forward in
  Brussels and claimed that his EU counterparts had "prevaricated and
  obfuscated" to avoid new anti-BSE health controls. 
<P>
  There were legal doubts over Britain's move last night, and suspicions
  in Brussels that Dr Cunningham was <FONT COLOR="#990099">seeking to distract attention</FONT> from
  his ban on the sale of beef on the bone, which came into force at
  midnight in spite of protests and demonstrations by farmers, butchers
  and consumers. No other European state has imposed such a restriction. 
<P>
  It was clear also that the <FONT COLOR="#990099">impact of his gesture would be limited</FONT>. Meat
  from Ireland, the main importer to Britain with 54,000 tonnes last
  year, France and The Netherlands already conforms to the planned code
  on the removal of the brain, spinal cord and eyes from cattle, sheep and
  goats. However, there was an obvious risk of the "war" being resumed,
  with the possibility of action against Britain in the European Court. 
<P>
  The strongest objection to the new British rules could be expected from
  Germany, which claims that it has no BSE and so its producers should
  not be burdened with costly processing requirements. 
<P>
  The European Commission sought the delay in the slaughterhouse code -
  agreed last July and due to come into effect on January 1 - after
  opposition from Germany and half a dozen other EU states, as well as the
  United States, whose pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries are
  affected. Last Saturday the Americans extended their own ban of
  European beef imports in what Brussels saw as retaliation for the
  proposed meat hygiene rules. 
<P>
  A unilateral ban on beef imports would certainly breach EU rules
  covering the single market, as Dr Cunningham accepted. "I cannot ban
  imports of beef - though I think farmers would like me to - that would
  be a matter that would have me straight into the European Court," he
  said. "But I can insist that it can only come in if it has had the specified
  risk materials removed and been treated the same as British beef." 
<P>
  That approach would break no rules, he said, because he was demanding
  only that meat sold in the shops should be subject to uniform safety
  checks. The Commission said it would form an opinion after considering
  the proposed ban in detail. 

  Dr Cunningham added: <BLOCKQUOTE>"I believe that people who have been opposed to
  the original decision have just been prevaricating and obfuscating and
  delaying. I am going to implement it unilaterally on behalf of the United
  Kingdom to make sure beef coming in is as safe as the beef we have at
  home. I can't believe that it is good for the reputation of the Commission
  or the EU that a decision properly taken in July has got to the point
  where it has failed to be implemented six months later." </BLOCKQUOTE>

  He rejected the claims of eight nations that they did not need such
  measures because they had not suffered from BSE. If the EU were to
  operate a single market in beef, the same rules and regulations had to
  apply throughout. 

  <BLOCKQUOTE>"There is a single market in beef, it is traded around that single market
  and there is no guarantee that beef coming from any country in the EU is
  beef that has been raised in that country. You can purchase beef in one
  country where BSE exists and wholesale it from another country where
  BSE doesn't exist. So it is a completely fraudulent argument to suggest
  that somehow that provides a safeguard. It doesn't provide any safeguard
  at all."</BLOCKQUOTE> 

  Last year Britain <FONT COLOR="#990099">imported 150,000 tonnes of beef worth £363
  million</FONT> from all sources, of which 93,100 tonnes came from the rest of
  the European Union, according to the Meat and Livestock Commission. 
<P>

  The Ministry of Agriculture said last night that all non-EU suppliers,
  with the exception of New Zealand and Australia, would have to comply
  with the new regulations if their meat was to be marketable in Britain.
  Australia and New Zealand are considered to pose no threat from either
  BSE or scrapie, the related sheep disease. 

  An aid package for hill farmers affected by the BSE crisis is expected to
  be announced later this week.

<a NAME="xxx"></a><center><h3>Doctors planning CJD screening test</h3></center>
<pre>Sun, Dec 14, 1997 PA News By Chris Barry</pre> 
  Doctors investigating the spread of CJD, the human form of mad cow
disease, are <FONT COLOR="#990099">planning to introduce a nationwide screening programme</FONT>, it was
reported today.
   Scientists at the CJD Surveillance Unit at the Western Infirmary,
Edinburgh, want <FONT COLOR="#990099">to test tonsils extracted from patients and brains from
people killed in road accidents</FONT>, The Sunday Telegraph claims.<P>

   The newspaper says the head of the unit, Dr Robert Will, suggested the
move at a meeting of directors of the UK's haemophilia centres in which new
variant CJD was discussed.
   Details of the programme are expected to be disclosed in the medical
journal Lancet in the next few weeks.<P>

   Under the plan scientists the brain, lymph system and blood of road
accident victims over the age of 16 would be tested for the prion protein
associated with the new variant of the incurable disease.
   It is believed it would take between six months to a year of tests for
doctors to gain an insight into how widespread the disease has become.<P>

   In the case of tonsils, tests would almost certainly be anonymous, in
the same way that pregnant women are tested to determine the prevalence of
HIV in the population.
   At present patients attending sexually transmitted disease clinics are
also asked if they will give blood samples to test for the HIV virus, and
are then given the choice of being told the results.<P>

   Scientists working at St Mary's medical school in London have already
began to develop the tonsil test, and have apparently found evidence of the
prion protein on tonsular tissue.

<a NAME="yyy"></a><center><h3>CJD research chief denies screening plan report
</h3></center>
<pre>Sun, 14 Dec 1997 PA News By Chris Barry, PA News</pre>
 The head of the scientific team researching CJD, the human form of mad
cow disease, today <FONT COLOR="#990099">denied there are plans</FONT> to introduce a nationwide
screening programme to discover how far the incurable condition has spread.
   Dr Robert Will, the director of the Edinburgh-based CJD Surveillance
Unit, said newspaper reports that he wanted to set up a national programme
to screen for new variant CJD were "<FONT COLOR="#990099">misleading and inaccurate</FONT>".
   <P>
The Sunday Telegraph reported that brain tissue of road accident victims
and extracted tonsils would be tested for the protein, prion, which is
associated with the disease.
   But Dr Will, who leads the 10-strong research team at Edinburgh's
Western General hospital, said from his home in the city: "The reports are
incorrect, there are no plans for a national programme as far as I am
aware."
   He said he had been invited to attend a meeting of the directors of the
UK's haemophilia centres, in which the "theoretical possibility" of testing
was raised.
   <BLOCKQUOTE>"One small component of the meeting involved discussing CJD. Someone
raised the possibility of studying the number of people incubating the
disease, but this was only on a theoretical basis.
   "A national programme was not mentioned. There are no plans for this as
far as I am aware, and I have not agreed to write a letter to the Lancet
advising doctors and coroners."
   "I have just discussed the matter with the chairman of the meeting and
he has confirmed my interpretation of the events," Dr Will added.</BLOCKQUOTE>
   Dr Will said the State-funded unit was investigating the possibility
that brain tissue and tonsils could be tested for CJD, but said there were
no firm plans to do this.
   The Surveillance Unit currently performs post mortem examinations on the
bodies of people who may have died from the new variant of the wasting
disease.
   At present the only way of identifying the condition is to study brain
tissue after death.<P>

   The Sunday Telegraph also reported that scientists working at St Mary's
medical school in London have already began to develop the tonsil test, and
have apparently found evidence of prions -- the form of protein thought to
be responsible for the development of CJD -- on tonsular tissue.

<H4> Sunday Telegraph </H4><PRE>14.12.97 Dealler summary</PRE>
<blockquote> "Health chiefs laungh mass CJD screening:his is a programme of investigating
anonymously the brains of any people that have died of specific causes in the UK. e.g. road accidents. The aim of this
would be to look for prevalence data for nvCJD in the population. It is to be announced in the Lancet in a letter. Rob
Will, who is supposed to be doing it says that the experiments <font COLOR="#990099">would involve the histopathological methods
associated with tonsil biopsy</font>. <p>
The Department of Health, from whom the funding is expected to be coming, has
denied being asked for the money so far. The tonsil test is actually a very difficult thing to do simply because the
histopathological changes that may be seen are almost the last changes before clinical symptoms appear. Western
blotting or the Narang test using electron microscopy may be a better method to be using. Obviously the most
efficient would be the inoculation of transgenic mice but <FONT COLOR="#990099">this was turned down by the Medical Research Council</FONT>
in 1996" - SD </blockquote>

<a NAME="zzz"></a><center><h3>Blood product withdrawn after CJD scare</h3></center>
<pre>Sun, 14 Dec 1997  PA News By Chris Parkin, PA News</pre>
 
   The manufacturers of a blood product at the centre of a CJD scare
tonight stressed there was no evidence of contamination.
   The product <FONT COLOR="#990099">Amerscan Pulmonate Two</FONT> had been used in treatment for nearly
<FONT COLOR="#990099">270 patients in nine Irish hospitals</FONT>.
   It was withdrawn when it was discovered that its manufacture had
involved <FONT COLOR="#990099">plasma from a donor who subsequently died from new variant CJD</FONT>,
the human equivalent of BSE.<P>

   The product is an agent used to diagnose lung disease, and 320 doses
from three batches were sent to Ireland, with 268 <FONT COLOR="#990099">used before the recall.</FONT>
  <P>
 Alan Huw Smith, corporate director for the company involved, Nycomed
Amersham, said nothing had happened to indicate evidence of contamination
in their product.
   He said the withdrawal was made as a precautionary measure and not
because of any clinical event to show contamination.
   The Irish Department of Health confirmed the recall had been directed as
a precaution, following confirmation that a blood donor, whose plasma had
been used, subsequently developed CJD.
   A statement said: <BLOCKQUOTE>"While there is no evidence that CJD has been
transmitted by blood products, this particular donor had the new variant of
the condition and against this background, recall of the product was seen
as a sensible precaution."
   The department said arrangements were being made for the recipients of
the product to be informed "in the most sensitive, prudent and sympathetic
way possible."</BLOCKQUOTE>
   It was understood tonight that the donor involved <FONT COLOR="#990099">gave the blood in
1993</FONT>, and later developed new variant CJD.
 <P>
   A spokesman for the Department of Health in London said the Medicines
Control Agency had advised the manufacturers of Amerscan Pulmonate Two to
withdraw the relevant batch of its product last month.
   He added: <BLOCKQUOTE>"This <FONT COLOR="#990099">purely precautionary</FONT> measure was in line with the advice
of the European expert body, the Committee on Proprietary Medicine
Products."</BLOCKQUOTE>
   The department tonight also pointed to a statement about CJD issued by
the Chief Medical Officer, Sir Kenneth Calman, on October 6.
   It said that the safety of blood and blood products had been considered
on several occasions by a number of international bodies, and all had
concluded "that any risk of contracting CJD through blood or blood
derivatives is negligible".
<H4>Hundreds of people received blood contaminated with mad cow disease</H4>
<PRE>December 14, 1997  Agence France-Presse </PRE>

DUBLIN  - Nearly 270 people in Ireland have received
blood from a British donor who was infected with the Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease virus, the human form of "mad cow"
disease, the Irish health ministry said Sunday. Blood products from the donor were transfused into patients in nine Irish hospitals before it was learnt that the donor
had died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD). The products were immediately withdrawn from the market on
November 26 and destroyed, the ministry said.
<P>
A department of health spokesman said that there was no evidence CJD could be transmitted by blood or blood products
but the product was withdrawn as "a precautionary measure."

<BLOCKQUOTE>"This is an <FONT COLOR="#990099">injectable agent used by radiology departments in lung scans</FONT>. The department understands that
approximately 270 people were involved," the spokesman added.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The product -- three batches of Amerscam Pulmonate II agent, which is used to diagnose lung disease -- was
withdrawn following confirmation that "one of the blood donors in the U.K. whose plasma was used to manufacture the
product subsequently developed new variant CJD."

"This product is manufactured in the U.K. and is purchased by hospitals (in Ireland) through an Irish distributor of
the U.K. company."

In its statement, the department of health said it would make arrangements for those who had been given the blood to
be informed "in the most sensitive, prudent and sympathetic way possible."

Earlier this month, a British daily reported that Britain might have exported the blood of a CJD victim to 46
countries.

The new form of CJD, the human form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or mad cow disease), has killed 22
people in Britain.

<center><h3>Ireland <A NAME="starts">starts</A> to track down patients in new mad cow scare</h3>
</center>
<PRE>December 15, 1997 Agence France-Presse </PRE>

DUBLIN   - Ireland's health authorities Monday began
<FONT COLOR="#990099">tracking down</FONT> 270 people who received transfusions using blood products from a British company sold in more than
50 countries and which could have been contaminated by Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, the human form of "mad cow"
disease.

The Irish government tried to play down the latest scare, saying there was only a very small risk for the patients
involved and <FONT COLOR="#990099">promised to inform them in a "prudent and sensitive" way</FONT>.

It announced Sunday that 268 people were treated with the suspect product, Amerscam Pulmonate, an injectible agent
used in lung scans in radiology departments.
<P>
Opposition parties accused the government of waiting too long before alerting the public when it knew of the risks
from Nov. 26. 
<P>
The maker of the product, Britain's Nycomed Amersham, said Monday that the batch of suspect products -- made with
the blood of a British donor who later died of CJD -- <FONT COLOR="#990099">could have been sold in 52 countries altogether</FONT>, where the
company has clients.

The laboratory, outside London, says it sold more than 10,000 product units between June and October this year, and
has issued a warning to all its clients.
<P>
Alan Huw-Smith, the company's corporate affairs director who had originally estimated that the suspect
consignments had been sold in 40 countries, said checks were being made with the countries concerned Monday.

A provisional list included 13 countries -- Belgium, Britain, Colombia, Denmark Finland, Germany, Ireland, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, Spain and Sweden.

Of the 10,000 units sold <FONT COLOR="#990099">only "15 percent have been sent back so far</FONT>," he said. That did not mean that the remaining
85 percent had been used. 
<P>
The company, alerted by British health authorities in November, said the withdrawal was a precautionary measure.
There was no proof that CJD could be transmitted through blood.

Huw-Smith said: <BLOCKQUOTE>"There is no evidence that the blood was contaminated, no evidence that the serum was contaminated
and no evidence that this particular batch of our product was contaminated."</BLOCKQUOTE>

He said it was understood the blood donation was made in the early 1990s. "There is a considerable delay between the
time when this donation was given and the time when the donor was diagnosed as having contracted CJD."
<P>

There is no proof at present of a possible transmission between humans through blood transfusions, but the risk is
not excluded by scentists.

The British government recently envisaged treating systematically all blood donations and blood products to eliminate
any possible infections.

An inquiry is currently under way in Britain after eye tissue from a woman who died of CJD were used for corneal
grafts on three patients.

<a NAME="aaa"></a><center><h3>Portugal to screen blood to reduce CJD risk</h3></center>
<pre>Reuters Fri, Dec 12, 1997</pre>

    LISBON  - Portugal will start screening blood next
year to reduce the risk of infection from the human equivalent of mad cow
disease, a senior health official said on Friday.
     Portugal will be the <FONT COLOR="#990099">first country in Europe to take steps</FONT> to screen
blood for an agent that causes Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD), said Jose
de Almeida Goncalves, president of the state-run Portuguese Blood
Institute.
    <BLOCKQUOTE> "From April 1, 1998 blood banks will use filters to extract white
cells in order to eliminate any risk of infection with CJD," Almeida
Goncalves told Reuters. "No one knows if a CJD epidemic is going to happen.
Our action is purely precautionary," he added.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     Doctors have said that Britain's national blood supply could be
infected with a new strain of CJD. Britain is also considering removing
white blood cells from donated blood and plasma.
     <FONT COLOR="#990099">Eight cases of CJD have been reported in Portugal so far this year, up

<pre>Fri, Dec 12, 1997 Reuters World Report</pre>Date: Fri, 12 Dec 1997 19:30:58 -0500

WASHINGTON  - The United States will restrict the
import of cattle, sheep and some livestock products from 21 European
nations until there is proof of no "mad cow" risk from them, the
Agriculture Department said on Friday.<P>
     Similar restrictions are already in place for ruminant animals and
some livestock products, such as fresh meat and meat and bone meal from
Britain, France, Ireland, Oman, Portugal, Switzerland, the Netherlands,
Belguim and Luxembourg. "Mad cow" disease or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy has been detected in those nations.<P>

    The department said the restrictions would be lifted for countries that
employ sufficiently strong surveillance systems. "We made this decision to
protect human and animal health, to protect the security of our export
markets, and to protect the safety and integrity of our food supply,"
Assistant Agriculture Secretary Mike Dunn said in a statement.
     Action followed discovery in Belgium and Luxembourg of infected cattle
and research identifying BSE infectivity in bone marrow and other
materials.<P>

     In addition, the United States has disputed a European Union plan to
ban imports of some livestock products including tallow and gelatin.
Washington has estimated the EU rule could disrupt $4.5 billion in cosmetic
and pharmaceutical trade. The United States says, with no U.S. history of
BSE, its products are safe.<P>

     The Agriculture Department said it stopped issuing import permits for
animals and the specified products from Albania, Austria, Bosnia, Bulgaria,
Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Yugoslavia, Finland, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, Italy, Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia,
Spain and Sweden.
  <H4>U.S. bans imports of European meat</H4>
 <PRE>December 13, 1997 The Washington Post/AP/ Reuter</PRE>
 
The United States Friday banned imports of all cattle and sheep from
Europe until the risk of spreading mad cow disease in this country is
fully examined.
Michael V. Dunn, assistant agriculture secretary for marketing and
regulatory programs, was quoted as saying, "We made this decision to
protect human and animal health, to protect the security of our export
markets, and to protect the safety and integrity of our food supply."
The stories add that previously, USDA had restricted imports of cattle,
sheep and many products such as fresh meat and bone meal, from nine
European countries where the disease was known to exist.
The action announced late Friday expands that ban to most other European
countries.<P>

Dunn was also cited as saying that the decision to expand the import
restrictions came after two animals diagnosed with mad cow disease in
Belgium and Luxembourg went into
the animal food processing system, adding, "This import policy is
science-based and consistent" with international guidelines.
The stories add that USDA will lift the import restrictions for any
country that shows it has a mad cow surveillance program that conforms
to
international standards and contains adequate controls for import.<P>

A USDA spokesman was cited as telling Reuters that the new restrictions
were <FONT COLOR="#990099">not related</FONT> to the US-European Union dispute over tallow, cattle
brains and related livestock products.

<a NAME="ddd"></a><center><h3>Health chiefs launch mass screening for CJD</h3></center>
<pre>Telegraph Sunday 14 December 1997 By Victoria Macdonald, Health Correspondent</pre>
 A nationwide screening programme for hospital patients and accident victims is to be carried out to assess how
far the human form of mad cow disease has spread. The CJD Surveillance Unit is to test the tonsils of patients who have them removed, and also the brains of people who
die in road accidents. It has also emerged that <FONT COLOR="#990099">doctors in Oxford have started</FONT> taking samples from the brains
of bodies sent for autopsy , to look for new variant CJD.
<P>
The Telegraph has learned that Dr Robert Will, director of the CJD unit, presented his plans to the directors of the
UK haemophilia centres during a closed meeting on nvCJD. Dr Will was not available for comment, but a doctor who
attended the meeting <FONT COLOR="#990099">confirmed that Dr Will laid out a programme for testing living and deceased patients</FONT> for the
disease, which has been linked to BSE.
<P>
The programme is expected to be disclosed in a letter to the Lancet within the next few weeks from Dr Will and
addressed to doctors and coroners. Under the plan, brain tissue, lymph system and blood of people killed in
road accidents would be tested for the prion protein associated with nvCJD.

Only the brains of people aged over 16 would be used. <FONT COLOR="#990099">Permission would have to be obtained from relatives</FONT>, as is also
the case in the Oxford research. There were <FONT COLOR="#990099">3,600 road deaths in Britain last year</FONT> and if even half the relatives
agreed to a biopsy, doctors would gain a reasonable marker on how many people are infected.
<P>
Dr Will told the meeting that with this study, and that using tonsular tissue, it would take six to 12 months to
determine the extent of the disease's spread. Testing would almost certainly be anonymous, with any patient carrying
the disease unlikely to be told they are infected .
<P>

... The British Medical Association and the Royal College
of Pathologists both expressed concerns at the ethical implications of the testing. The BMA said that as long as the tonsil testing was performed anonymously it would be acceptable, but a spokesman
said the association had reservations about the testing of brains of accident victims.
<P>
A Department of Health spokesman said: "As far as I know, no proposal has been sent to the department ."
<FONT COLOR="#990099">However, at Oxford, research using brain tissue from autopsy cases is being paid for by the Department of
Health.</FONT> The work is led by <FONT COLOR="#990099">Professor Margaret Esiri</FONT>, a neuropathologist at the Radcliffe Infirmary.

<BLOCKQUOTE>"If there is anything going on in the general population, we would expect to pick it up, but so far there have been no
nvCJD cases," she said. "It is only a tiny sample and we do not know how useful the testing will be."</BLOCKQUOTE>

There had been a mixed response from relatives, "just as there is in organ donation cases".

<center><h3>E.U. <A NAME="Commission">Commission</A> 'Seriously Regrets' U.S. Beef Import Move</h3></center><PRE>15 Dec 97 Dow Jones By Jonathan Stearns</PRE> 
BRUSSELS --The European Union Commission said Monday it '<FONT COLOR="#990099">seriously
regrets</FONT>' a U.S. decision to restrict imports of E.U. beef and to ban imports of
all E.U. cattle, sheep and goats. 
  Spokesman Gerard Kiely suggested the <FONT COLOR="#990099">move is meant to pressure the Commission,
the E.U. executive, into exempting the U.S. from a proposed ban</FONT> on products
deemed at risk of harboring 'mad cow' disease and into formally endorsing a
transatlantic accord on animal products trade. 
 <P>
 'We seriously regret this decision because it's not well founded and we had no
prior warning of it,' Kiely said at a meeting with journalists. 
  Saying the U.S. import restrictions won't have a 'major' economic consequence
for the 15-member E.U., Kiely questioned whether the U.S. had an '<FONT COLOR="#990099">ulterior
motive</FONT>' for imposing them. 
  <P>
He noted strong U.S. opposition to a planned E.U. ban on pharmaceuticals,
cosmetics and other products considered at risk of harboring bovine spongiform
encephalopathy. The U.S. has said the ban, due to take effect March 31, 1998,
would disrupt billions of dollars a year in U.S. pharmaceuticals exports. <P>

  Kiely also cited U.S. criticism of the Commission's refusal in November to
recommend that E.U. countries ratify a 'veterinary equivalency' agreement with
the U.S. until the U.S. Agriculture Department offers more concessions on
imports of animal products from E.U. countries where a disease has broken out. 
   Kiely said the Commission will seek more information from the U.S. about
the reasons for the import restrictions. <P>

  Meanwhile, E.U. agriculture ministers are likely to discuss the issue at a
two-day meeting in Brussels beginning later Monday, Kiely said. 
  The U.S. decided Friday to restrict imports of beef and to ban imports of live
ruminants from across the E.U. and other European countries because of concerns
about BSE. It cited recent evidence that animals infected with BSE in Belgium
and Luxembourg had been used for animal feed in Europe as justifications for the
move. <P>

  Until Friday, the U.S. had been restricting imports of beef from just seven
E.U. countries - the U.K., France, Ireland, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium
and Luxembourg. The restrictions, based on confirmed BSE cases in those
countries,<FONT COLOR="#990099"> amounted to a ban on bone-in beef but not boneless beef.</FONT> <P>

  In 1996, E.U. <FONT COLOR="#990099">exports of beef and live cattle, sheep and goats to the U.S.</FONT>
were worth a total of about $3 million. Of that, E.U. beef exports amounted to
about $2.6 million.

He said that research he had asked to do (<FONT COLOR="#990099">to look for BSE

program was completely damning of the MAFF as a protector of human health from food, and showed how science
findings were manipulated to give the impression to the consumer that 'everything was fine' (e.g. the marmoset
monkey that died of BSE was looked on as an important result before it died and was then almost ignored). <P>
Various
people (Collinge included) stated that they felt an inquiry was needed and that this should be a judicial one in order
to bring the information forward. (My own opinion of the program was that far more could have been shown of how
<FONT COLOR="#990099">information was hidden from scientists, press, probably the House of Commons and certainly from foreign groups</FONT>
but probably there was not time to show it. It showed that the scientists themselves did their best but it was the
<FONT COLOR="#990099">higher officials that were determined that BSE would not affect the beef industry no matter what the findings</FONT> were.
An inquiry that can suboena witnesses is essential but this is not completely clear in the program - Steve Dealler,

<center><h3>USDA: <A NAME="Live">Live</A> ruminant imports from Europe restricted</h3>
</center><PRE>OTC (COMTEX NewswireMon, Dec 15, 1997</PRE>


Washington --USDA has announced in a formal statement restrictions on
the importation of live ruminants and certain ruminant products from Europe
until the risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) can be further
assessed.
   As reported by FWN last Friday, USDA on Dec. 11 stopped issuing import
permits for all live ruminants, including cattle and sheep, and ruminant
products such as meat and bone meal and fresh meat, from Europe until USDA
scientists can assess the risk of BSE and evaluate surveillance activities in
individual countries. 
<P>
   USDA has requested information from affected countries and will evaluate that
information upon receipt, the statement said. USDA will lift import restrictions
with respect to any country found to have a surveillance program that conforms
to international standards and adequate import controls. 
   "We made this decision to protect human and animal health, to protect the
security of our export markets and to protect the safety and the integrity of
our food supply," said Michael Dunn, USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service assistant secretary for marketing and regulatory programs. <P>

   Such action was initiated at this time in part because of several recent
developments related to BSE in  Europe. A bovine animal native to Belgium was
diagnosed as BSE positive and subsequently processed into the animal food chain,
as was another bovine animal native  to Luxembourg.  Also, on Dec. 3, scientists
in the United  Kingdom identified BSE infectivity in dorsal root ganglion,
trigeminal ganglion, and bone marrow, according to the statement. <P>

   Until now, USDA regulations restricted the importation of ruminants and
ruminant products only from countries that have reported BSE diagnosed in
native-  born cattle. Countries known to be affected with BSE include the United
Kingdom, France, the Republic of Ireland, Oman, Portugal, Switzerland, the
Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. <P>

   Products presenting minimal risk of BSE transmission--including <FONT COLOR="#990099">semen, milk
and milk products, hides and skins, tallow and tallow derivatives, and certain
blood products used in microbiologic media--are  excluded</FONT> from the new import
restrictions. Products such as gelatin and collagen for human use are addressed 
through authority of the Food and Drug Administration. 

   <BLOCKQUOTE>"This import policy is science based and consistent with international
guidelines set forth by the Office of International Epizootics," Dunn added. </BLOCKQUOTE>
   The new restrictions apply to the following  countries: Albania, Austria,
Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic,
Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.
