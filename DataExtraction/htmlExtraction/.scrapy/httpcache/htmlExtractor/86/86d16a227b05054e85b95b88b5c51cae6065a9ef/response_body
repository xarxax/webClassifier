          four little people whose names were </p>
        <center>
          <p><img SRC="fc01.gif" ALT="pict 1" WIDTH="427" HEIGHT="216"></p>
          <p align="left">and they all thought they should like to see the world. 
            So they bought a large boat to sail quite round the world by sea, 
            and then they were to come back on the other side by land. The boat 
            was painted blue with green spots, and the sail was yellow with red 
            stripes; and when they set off, they only took a small Cat to steer 
            and look after the boat, besides an elderly Quangle-Wangle, who had 
            to cook dinner and make the tea; for which purposes they took a large 
            kettle. </p>
        </center>
        <center>
          <p><img SRC="fc02.gif" ALT="pict 2" WIDTH="458" HEIGHT="195"></p>
          <p align="left">For the first ten days they sailed on beautifully, and 
            found plenty to eat, as there were lots of fish, and they only had 
            to take them out of the sea with a long spoon, when the Quangle-Wangle 
            instantly cooked them, and the Pussy-cat was fed with the bones, with 
            which she expressed herself pleased on the whole, so that all the 
            party were very happy. </p>

          <p><img SRC="fc03.gif" ALT="pict 3" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="221"></p>
          <p align="left">During the daytime, Violet chiefly occupied herself 
            in putting salt-water into the churn, while her three brothers churned 
            it violently, in the hope that it would turn into butter, which it 
            seldom, if ever did; and in the evening they all retired into the 
            Tea-kettle, where they all managed to sleep very comfortably, while 
            Pussy and the Quangle-Wangle managed the boat. </p>
        </center>
        <center>
          <p><img SRC="fc04.gif" ALT="pict 4" WIDTH="467" HEIGHT="213"></p>
          <p align="left">After a time they saw some land at a distance; and when 
            they came to it, they found it was an island made of water quite surrounded 
            by earth. Besides that, it was bordered by evanescent isthmusses with 
            a great Gulf-stream running about all over it, so that it was perfectly 
            beautiful, and contained only a single tree, 503 feet high. </p>
        </center>
        <p> <img SRC="fc05.gif" ALIGN="left" ALT="pict 5" WIDTH="198" HEIGHT="618"> When they had landed, 
          they walked about, but found to their great surprise, that the island 
          was quite full of veal-cutlets and chocolate-drops, and nothing else. 
          So they all climbed up the single high tree to discover, if possible, 
          if there were any people; but having remained on the top of the tree 
          for a week, and not seeing anybody, they naturally concluded that there 
          were no inhabitants, and accordingly when they came down, they loaded 
          the boat with two thousand veal-cutlets and a million of chocolate drops, 
          and these afforded them sustenence for more than a month, during which 
          time they pursued their voyage with the utmost delight and apathy. </p>
        <p> After this they came to a shore where there were no less than sixty-five 
          great red parrots with blue tails, sitting on a rail all of a row, and 
          all fast asleep. And I am sorry to say that the Pussy-cat and the Quangle-Wangle 
          crept softly and bit off the tail-feathers of all the sixty-five parrots, 
          for which Violet reproved them both severely. 
          <center>
            <p><img SRC="fc06.gif" ALT="pict 6" WIDTH="431" HEIGHT="153"></p>
            <p align="left">Notwithstanding which, she proceeded to insert all 
              the feathers, two hundred and sixty in number, in her bonnet, thereby 
              causing it to have a lovely and glittering appearance, highly prepossessing 
              and efficacious. </p>
            <center>
              <p><img SRC="fc07.gif" ALT="pict 7" WIDTH="210" HEIGHT="261"> </p>
              <p align="left">The next thing that happened to them was in a narrow 
                part of the sea, which was so entirely full of fishes that the 
                boat could go no further; so they remained there about six weeks, 
                till they had eaten nearly all the fishes, which were Soles, and 
                all ready-cooked and covered with shrimp sauce, so that there 
                was no trouble whatever. And as the few fishes that remained uneaten 
                compleined of the cold, as well as of the difficulty they had 
                in getting any sleep on account of the extreme noise made by the 
                Arctic Bears and the Tropical Turnspits which frequented the neighbourhood 
                in great numbers, Violet most amiably knitted a small woollen 
                frock for several of the fishes, and Slingsby administered some 
                opium drops to them, through which kindness they became quite 
                warm and slept soundly. </p>
              <center>
                <p><img SRC="fc08.gif" ALT="pict 8" WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="258"> </p>
                <p align="left">Then they came to a country which was wholly covered 
                  with immense Orange-trees of a vast size, and quite full of 
                  fruit. So they all landed, taking with them a Tea-kettle, intending 
                  to gather some of the Oranges and place them in it. But while 
                  they were busy about this, a most dreadfully high wind rose, 
                  and blew out most of the Parrot-tail feathers from Violet's 
                  bonnet. That, however, was nothing compared with the calamity 
                  of the Oranges falling down on their heads by millions and millions, 
                  which thumped and bumped and bumped and thumped them all so 
                  seriously that they were obliged to run as hard as they could 
                  for their lives, besides that the sound of the Oranges rattling 
                  on the Tea-kettle was of the most fearful and amazing nature. 
                </p>

                  <p><img SRC="fc09.gif" ALT="pict 9" WIDTH="432" HEIGHT="234"> </p>
                  <p align="left">Nevertheless they got safely to the boat, although 
                    considerably vexed and hurt; and the Quangle-Wangle's right 
                    foot was so knocked about, that he had to sit with his head 
                    in his slipper for at least a week. </p>

                    <p><img SRC="fc10.gif" ALT="pict 10" WIDTH="338" HEIGHT="156"> </p>
                    <p align="left">This event made them all for a time rather 
                      melancholy, and perhaps they might never have become less 
                      so, had not Lionel with a most praiseworthy devotion and 
                      perseverance, continued to stand on one leg and whistle 
                      to them in a loud and lively manner, which diverted the 
                      whole party so extremely, that they gradually recovered 
                      their spirits, and agreed that whenever they should reach 
                      home they would subscribe towards a testimonial to Lionel, 
                      entirely made of Gingerbread and Raspberries, as an earnest 
                      token of their sincere and grateful infection. </p>

                      <p><img SRC="fc11.gif" ALT="pict 11" WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="180"> </p>
                      <p align="left">After sailing on calmly for several more 
                        days, they came to another country, where they were much 
                        pleased and surprised to see a countless mltitude of white 
                        Mice with red eyes, all sitting in a great circle, slowly 
                        eating Custard Pudding with the most satisfactory and 
                        polite demeanour. </p>
                      <center>
                        <p><img SRC="fc12.gif" ALT="pict 12" WIDTH="473" HEIGHT="96"> </p>
                        <p align="left">And as the four Travellers were rather 
                          hungry, being tired of eating nothing but Soles and 
                          Oranges for so long a period, they held a council as 
                          to the propriety of asking the Mice for some of their 
                          Pudding in a humble and affecting manner, by which they 
                          could hardly be otherwise than gratified. It was agreed 
                          therefore that Guy should go and ask the Mice, which 
                          he immediately did; and the result was that they gave 
                          a Walnut-shell only half full of Custard diluted with 
                          water. Now, this displeased Guy, who said, 'Out of such 
                          a lot of Pudding as you have got, I must say you might 
                          have spared a somewhat larger quantity!' But no sooner 
                          had he finished speaking than all the Mice turned round 
                          at once, and sneezed at him in an appalling and vindictive 
                          manner, (and it is impossible to imagine a more scroobious 
                          and unpleasant sound than that caused by the simultaneous 
                          sneezing of many millions of angry Mice,) so that Guy 
                          rushed back to othe boat, having first shied his cap 
                          into into the middle of the Custard Pudding, by which 
                          means he completely spoiled the Mice's dinner. </p>

                          <p align="left">By-and-by the Four Children came to 
                            a country where there were no houses, but only an 
                            incredibly innumerable number of large bottles without 
                            corks, and of a dazzling and sweetly susceptible blue 
                            colour. Each of these blue bottles contained a Blue-Bottle 
                            Fly, and all of these interesting animals live continually 
                            together in the most copious and rural harmony, nor 
                            perhaps in many parts of the world is such perfect 
                            and abject happiness to be found. Violet, and Slingsby, 
                            and Guy, and Lionel, were greatly struck with this 
                            singular and instructive settlement, and having previously 
                            asked permission of the Blue-Bottle-Flies (which was 
                            most courteously granted), the Boat was drawn up to 
                            the shore and they proceeded to make tea in front 
                            of the Bottles; but as they had no tea-leaves, they 
                            merely placed some pebbles in the hot water, and the 
                            Quangle-Wangle played some tunes over it on an Accordion, 
                            by which of course tea was made directly, and of the 
                            very best quality. </p>

                            <p><img SRC="fc14.gif" ALT="pict 14" WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="155"> </p>
                            <p align="left">The Four Children then entered into 
                              conversation with the Blue Bottle-Flies, who discoursed 
                              in a placid and genteel manner, though with a slightly 
                              buzzing accent, chiefly owing to the fact that they 
                              each held a small clothes-brush between their teeth 
                              which naturally occasioned a fizzy extraneous utterance.

              </center>
            </center>
          </center>
        </p>
        <p> 'Why,' said Violet, 'would you kindly inform us, do you reside in 
          hottles? and if in bottles at all, why not rather in green or purple, 
          or indeed in yellow bottles?' </p>
        <p> To which questions a very aged Blue-Bottle-Fly answered, 'We found 
          the bottles here all ready to live in, that is to say, our great-great-great-great-great-grandfathers 
          did, so we occupied them at once. And when the winter comes on, we turn 
          the bottles upside down, and consequently rarely feel the cold at all, 
          and you know very well that this could not be the case with bottles 
          of any other colour than blue.' </p>
        <p> 'Of course it could not;' said Slingsby, 'but if we may take the liberty 
          of inquiring, on what do you chiefly subsist?' </p>
        <p> 'Mainly on Oyster-patties,' said the Blue-Bottle-Fly, 'and, when these 
          are scarce, on Raspberry vinegar and Russian leather boiled down to 
          a jelly.' </p>
        <p> 'How delicious!' said Guy. </p>
        <p> To which Lionel added, 'Huzz!' and all the Blue-Bottle-Flies said 
          'Buzz!' </p>
        <p> At this time, an elderly Fly said it was the hour of the Evening-song 
          to be sung; and on a signal being given all the Blue-Bottle-Flies began 
          to buzz at once in a sumptuous and sonorous manner, the melodious and 
          mucilaginous sounds echoing all over the waters, and resounding across 
          the tumultuous tops of the transitory Titmice upon the intervening and 
          verdant mountains, with a serene and sickly suavity only known to the 
          truly virtuous. The Moon was shining slobaciously from the star-bespringled 
          sky, while her light irrigated the smooth and shiny sides and wings 
          and backs of the Blue-Bottle-Flies with a peculiar and trivial splendour, 
          while all nature cheerfully responded to the cerulaean and conspicuous 
          circumstances. </p>
        <p> In many long-after years, the four little Travellers looked back to 
          that evening as one of the happiest in all their lives, and it was already 
          past midnight, when - the Sail of the Boat having been set up by the 
          Quangle-Wangle, the Tea-kettle and Churn placed in their respective 
          positions, and the Pussy-cat stationed at the Helm - the Children each 
          took a last and affectionate farewell of the Blue-Bottle-Flies, who 
          walked down in a body to the water's edge to see the Travellers embark. 
        </p>
        <p> As a token of parting respect and esteem, Violet made a curtsey quite 
          down to the ground, and stuck one of her few remaining Parrot-tail feathers 
          into the back hair of the most pleasing of the Blue-Bottle-Flies, while 
          Slingsby, Guy, and Lionel offered them three small boxes, containing 
          respectively, Black Pins, Dried Figs, and Epsom Salts: and thus they 
          left that happy shore for ever. 
          <center>
            <p><img SRC="fc15.gif" ALT="pict 15" WIDTH="452" HEIGHT="195"> </p>
            <p align="left">Overcome by their feelings, the Four little Travellers 
              instantly jumped into the Tea-kettle, and fell fast asleep. But 
              all along the shore for many hours there was distinctly heard a 
              sound of severely suppressed sobs, and of a vague multitude of living 
              creatures using their pocket-handkerchiefs in a subdued simultaneous 
              snuffle - lingering sadly along the wallopping waves as the boat 
              sailed farther and farther away from the Land of the Happy Blue-Bottle-Flies. 
            </p>
          </center>
        </p>
        <p> Nothing particular occurred for some days after these events, except 
          that as the Travellers were passing a low tract of sand, they perceived 
          an unusual and gratifying spectacle, namely, a large number of crabs 
          and crawfish - perhaps six or seven hundred - sitting by the water-side, 
          and endeavouring to disentangle a vast heap of pale pink worsted, which 
          they moistened at intervals with a fluid composed of Lavender-water 
          and White-wine Negus. </p>
        <p> 'Can we be of any service to you, O crusty Crabbies?' said the Four 
          Children. </p>
        <p> 'Thank you kindly,' said the Crabs, consecutively. 'We are trying 
          to make some worsted Mittens, but do not know how.' </p>
        <p> On which Violet, who was perfectly acquainted with the art of mitten-making, 
          said to the Crabs, 'Do your claws unscrew, or are they fixtures?' </p>
        <p> 'They are all made to unscrew,' said the Crabs, and forthwith they 
          deposited a great pile of claws close to the boat, with which Violet 
          uncombed all the pale pink worsted, and then made the loveliest Mittens 
          with it you can imagine. These the Crabs, having resumed and screwed 
          on their claws, placed cheerfully upon their wrists, and walked away 
          rapidly on their hind-legs, warbling songs with a silvery voice and 
          in a minor key. </p>
        <p> After this the four little people sailed on again till they came to 
          a vast and wide plain of astonishing dimensions, on which nothing whatever 
          could be discovered at first; but as the Travellers walked onward, there 
          appeared in the extreme and dim distance a single object, which on a 
          nearer approach and on an accurately cutaneous inspection, seemed to 
          be somebody in a large white wig sitting on an arm-chair made of Sponge 
          Cakes and Oyster-shells. 'It does not quite look like a human being,' 
          said Violet, doubtfully; nor could they make out what it really was, 
          till the Quangle-Wangle (who had previously been round the world), exclaimed 
          softly in a loud voice, 'It is the Co-operative Cauliflower!' 
          <center>
            <p><img SRC="fc16.gif" ALT="pict 16" WIDTH="437" HEIGHT="143"> </p>
            <p align="left">And so in truth it was, and they soon found that what 
              they had taken for an immense wig was in reality the top of the 
              cauliflower, and that he had no feet at all, being able to walk 
              tolerably well with a fluctuating and graceful movement on a single 
              cabbage stalk, an accomplishment which naturally saved him the expense 
              of stock ings and shoes. </p>
          </center>
        </p>
        <p> Presently, while the whole party from the boat was gazing at him with 
          mingled affection and disgust, he suddenly arose, and in a somewhat 
          plumdomphious manner hurried off towards the setting sun, - his steps 
          supported by two superincumbent confidential cucumbers, and a large 
          number of Waterwagtails proceeding in advance of him by three-and-three 
          in a row - till he finally disappeared on the brink of the western sky 
          in a crystal cloud of sudorific sand. 
          <center>
            <p><img SRC="fc17.gif" ALT="pict 17" WIDTH="455" HEIGHT="137"> </p>
            <p align="left">So remarkable a sight of course impressed the Four 
              Children very deeply; and they returned immediately to their boat 
              with a strong sense of undeveloped asthma and a great appetite. 
            </p>
          </center>
        </p>
        <p> Shortly after this the Travellers were obliged to sail directly below 
          some high overhanging rocks, from the top of one of which, a particularly 
          odious little boy, dressed in rose-coloured knickerbockers, and with 
          a pewter plate upon his head, threw an enormous Pumpkin at the boat, 
          by which it was instantly upset. 
          <center>
            <p><img SRC="fc18.gif" ALT="pict 18" WIDTH="311" HEIGHT="216"> </p>
            <p align="left">But this upsetting was of no consequence, because 
              all the party knew how to swim very well, and in fact they preferred 
              swimming about till after the moon rose, when the water growing 
              chilly, they sponge-taneously entered the boat. Meanwhile the Quangle-Wangle 
              threw back the Pumpkin with immense force, so that it hit the rocks 
              where the malicious little boy in rose-coloured knickerbockers was 
              sitting, when, being quite full of Lucifer-matches, the Pumpkin 
              exploded surreptitiously into a thousand bits, whereupon the rocks 
              instantly took fire, and the odious little boy became unpleasantly 
              hotter and hotter and hotter, till his knickerbockers were turned 
              quite green, and his nose was burned off. </p>
          </center>
        </p>
        <p> Two or three days after this had happened, they came to another place, 
          where they found nothing at all except some wide and deep pits full 
          of Mulberry Jam. This is the property of the tiny Yellow-nosed Apes 
          who abound in these districts, and who store up the Mulberry Jam for 
          their food in winter, when they mix it with pellucid pale periwinkle 
          soup, and serve it out in Wedgwood China bowls, which grow freely over 
          that part of the country. Only one of the Yellow-nosed Apes was on the 
          spot, and he was fast asleep: yet the Four Travellers and the Quangle-Wangle 
          and Pussy were so terrified by the violence and sanguinary sound of 
          his snoring, that they merely took a small cupful of the Jam, and returned 
          to re-embark in their Boat without delay. </p>
        <p> What was their horror on seeing the boat (including the Churn and 
          the Tea-kettle), in the mouth of an enormous Seeze Pyder, an aquatic 
          and ferocious creature truly dreadful to behold, and happily only met 
          with in those excessive longitudes. In a moment the beautiful boat was 
          bitten into fifty-five-thousand-million-hundred-billion bits, and it 
          instantly became quite clear that Violet, Slingsby, Guy, and Lionel 
          could no longer preliminate their voyage by sea. 
          <center>
            <p><img SRC="fc19.gif" ALT="pict 19" WIDTH="456" HEIGHT="147"> </p>
            <p align="left">The Four Travellers were therefore obliged to resolve 
              on pursuing their wanderings by land, and very fortunately there 
              happened to pass by at that moment, an elderly Rhinoceros, on which 
              they seized; and all four mounting on his back, the Quangle-Wangle 
              sitting on his horn and holding on by his ears, and the Pussy-cat 
              swinging at the end of his tail, they set off, having only four 
              small beans and three pounds of mashed potatoes to last through 
              their whole journey. </p>
            <center>
              <p><img SRC="fc20.gif" ALT="pict 20" WIDTH="455" HEIGHT="227"></p>
              <p align="left">They were, however, able to catch numbers of the 
                chickens and turkeys, and other birds who incessantly alighted 
                on the head of the Rhinoceros for the purpose of gathering the 
                seeds of the rhododendron plants which grew there, and these creatures 
                they cooked in the most translucent and satisfactory manner, by 
                means of a fire lighted on the end of the Rhinoceros' back. A 
                crowd of Kangaroos and Gigantic Cranes accompanied them, from 
                feelings of curiosity and complacency, so that they were never 
                at a loss for company, and went onward as it were in a sort of 
                profuse and triumphant procession. </p>
            </center>
          </center>
        </p>
        <p> Thus, in less than eighteen weeks, they all arrived safely at home, 
          where they were received by their admiring relatives with joy tempered 
          with contempt; and where they finally resolved to carry out the rest 
          of their travelling plans at some more favourable opportunity. </p>
        <p> As for the Rhinoceros, in token of their grateful adherence, they 
          had him killed and stuffed directly, and then set him up outside the 
          door of their father's house as a Diaphanous Doorscraper.
