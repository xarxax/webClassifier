<H2>Marketing Online Tricks & Traps</H2>
<P><font face="arial">Are you in need of internet marketing online and website promotion services?  There are 350 million Web pages on the Internet. Where is your site? How are people going to find it? Is your website buried in the cellars of the search engines and directories? Is it even on the radar screen?<P>"What should I do?" is an often heard question. And a good question it is! Fact is, PR and publicity is a lot of hard work, but you must commit the time and effort to make your site a success.  We are ready to help you accomplish your website marketing online goals.<P>One key is <FONT color=#ff0022><STRONG>marketing online</STRONG></FONT>, and another is timing. Whatever you decide to do, don't market online until your site is live and looking good. <P>Down the road, your marketing online efforts should be evaluated. Use <FONT color=#ff0022><STRONG>market analysis</STRONG></FONT> to find out who your visitors are (and how to get more of them). You'll want to do this with software that reads your server logs and pulls out data so you'll know first-hand how well your site is doing. <font face="Arial" size="4" color="#FF0000"><HR width="55%"><p align="center"><b>For a Limited Time<BR>*Money Saving Coupon*</font></font><BR><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#2F6090">FastStats Analyzer</font><BR>Special Pricing Exclusively through <a href="http://novahosting.com">NovaHosting.com</a><BR><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#FF0000">Important:</font> When you are ready to order, <a href="http://novahosting.com/faststats/coupon.html"> <font face="Arial" size="4" color="#FF0000">click here to save 10%.</A></b></font><P><HR width="55%"><p>
      <font face="arial">Promoting a Web site takes a lot of effort. Our marketing online packages cover everything from "soup to nuts," but keep in mind that you are the greatest asset of your business. You are the single point of success.<P>How can we help you help yourself? By optimizing your current site so the search engine robots find and index your site, and by evaluating your site for optimal search engine and link placement.
<P>A Web site without marketing is like a day without sunshine!   Whether you want to promote public awareness or sell products and services, letting your Web presence shine through is a must!  <FONT><B><FONT COLOR=FF0000>Marketing</FONT></B></FONT> is the key to your success.<P><B><I>Ask and You Shall Receive
</I></B><P>One way to promote your site is to ask others for <A HREF="http://www.marketing-online.net/links.html">LINKS</A> to your Web address.  In return, they may ask for a reciprocal link.  A link can be in the form of a small, colorful banner coded with your Web address, or a simple text link.  <FONT COLOR=FF0022><B>Web rings</B></FONT> are another way to promote your site.

<P>You can have a <FONT COLOR=FF0022><B>banner</B></FONT> made that projects your "corporate image" -- a small graphic with your logo, company name and a "hook" --&nbsp; to persuade
Web surfers to click and visit your site.&nbsp; Note: Do not depend on "click-throughs." For every 100 surfers who see a banner, only one or two will actually click 'n' go and usually not to buy.   

<P>"<FONT COLOR=FF0022><B>Hooks</B></FONT>,"&nbsp; like freebies, contests and special Web discounts and
coupons, have been proven to generate the greatest results in building traffic.&nbsp;
Designing a page and banner with this in mind can be rewarding.<P>
<B><I>Get Your Motor Goin'...Head Out on the Highway</I></B>
<P>Getting your links and banners on other sites will increase traffic, but not by much, so you may not want to spend money for banner advertising.&nbsp; Of course, small businesses do not usually have the resources
to advertise on sites.&nbsp; There are many options, however, that will
increase your traffic without depleting your profits before they are made.&nbsp;
<FONT COLOR=FF0022><B>Link exchange programs</B></FONT> allow you to trade banners or text links with others.&nbsp; Many
such programs are available at little or no cost to you.<P><B><I>I Heard It Through the Grapevine
</I></B><P>Links from associations within your industry will help increase traffic.&nbsp;
Many communities also offer links to businesses in their geographical area. Another method is to list your site in the Web's yellow pages, manufacturers' directories, classifieds, community and association sites, etc.<P><B><I>We Recommend:

<P>You can also write and post <B><FONT COLOR=FF0022>press releases</FONT></B> for the greatest exposure on the Web, but don't do this before contracting with a professional.  A call to a local reporter is one thing. Sending out a poorly written release SPAM style will definitely get you nowhere.<P><P><B><I>Email Marketing vs. SPAM</I></B><P>SPAM of any kind is a terrible idea. Unsolicited "bulk email services" must be avoided like the plague! Not only are such "campaigns" ineffective, but buying into this "bill of goods" can result in the loss of your Web site and Internet connection. True opt-in email is a better idea.
<P>Most Web users looking for a particular product or service will use
a <FONT COLOR=FF0022><B>search engine</B></FONT>.&nbsp; Search engines allow people to enter a few key words
such as "bicycle repair New York."&nbsp; This will bring up a list of companies
that provide this service in the specified area. 
<P><I><B>Collateral Marketing
</B></I><P>In addition to marketing on the Web, it is important to <B><FONT COLOR=FF0022>promote</FONT></B> your cyberspace address in other media.&nbsp; We recommend adding your Web site address to your business cards, letterhead and voice mail greetings, as well as any radio, TV or print advertisements you might run.

            through the eyes of the top search engines and directories to 
            ensure ranking readiness. Each search engine has a 
            different algorithm for content, body text, html code and other 
            factors. These factors change frequently and we stay on top 
            of the changes. Highly optimized sites get better rankings!</TD></TR>

          <TD>Meta tags are html placed between the 
            &lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt; tags of your web site code. 
            Once your site is solidly optimized, the next step is 
            finely tuned meta tags with correct syntax, key terms, 
            words and phrases. Search engines like some words 
            better than others; certain engines pay attention to case 
            sensitivity and others do not. Getting high rankings in 
            search engines is improved with good meta tags</TD></TR>
