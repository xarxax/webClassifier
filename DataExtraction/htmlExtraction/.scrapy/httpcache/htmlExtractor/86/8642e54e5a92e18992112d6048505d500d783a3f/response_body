<b>Update 10/20/2004:</b> Welcome Dave fans!  I just heard the announcement about Dave
taking a break from writing his weekly column.  While his writings will be sorely missed,
he's already written more funny stuff than most of us could write in ten lifetimes so he's
earned a break :)  <B>BUT</B> -- I know for a fact that many of Dave's columns from the 80's
and 90's have never been published in his books, although they must be archived somewhere.
I'm sure many of us would be willing to pay for a book of Dave's material that had never
before been collected in books.  If you would like to consider adding your name to a petition
to get Dave's previously unpublished columns compiled and published as a new book,
<a href = "mailto:bennett@peacefire.org">email me</a> (put "Dave petition" in the subject)
and I'll try to find out who to contact.

Dave Barry's columns are published every Friday on
<a href = "http://www.herald.com/davebarry/">his Web site</a> at the Miami
Herald.  But if you can't wait
that long, you can use this page to generate one instead.

Read <a href = "about.shtml">"About AutoDave"</a> for more information about Dave and this site.
