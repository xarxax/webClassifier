<p>	<b>It's all Hayama's fault!!!!!!!</b>

<p>	You'll never see elementary school the same way again. <i>Kodomo no 
Omocha</i> is the name of a manga feature which appeared in <i>Ribon</i> 
magazine along with such features as <i>Marmalade Boy</i> and <i>Nurse Angel 
Ririka SOS</i>. It's also been made into some of the most unique anime I've 
seen since <i>Macross 7</i>. The story might take place in an elementary 
school, not exactly the typical anime setting, but it's the characters who 
drive the show. They may be kids, but they act beyond their age, and the 
effect is kind of weird and very entertaining. You'll just have to see to 
understand what I mean. 

<p>	Expect a lot of word play, interesting Japanese expressions, visual 
metaphors, and non-stop energy. If it feels like there's a lot going on 
which isn't fully explained, you're right. There's a whole manga story 
behind <i>Kodomo no Omocha</i>, and the <i>Kodomo no Omocha</i> TV series is 
currently airing in Japan. Several of us on e-board really like this show, 
so if you hear us saying things like "Puchin!" or "C'mon Peggy!" - that's 
from this show. 

<p>	<b>The characters:</b>

<p>	<b>Sana-chan:</b> The hyper, super-gutsy, extroverted child actress 
whose TV school life is nothing like her real-life school. Her TV show is 
called <i>Kodomo no Omocha</i> - hence, the name of this OAV.

<p>	<b>Hayama Akito:</b> The head troublemaker of Sana-chan's class, one 
dark and troubled guy. [He's kind of cool.]

<p>	<b>Tsuyoshi:</b> One of Hayama's friends. He tries to keep Hayama 
from overdoing things. Actually a pretty nice guy.

<p>	<b>Rei:</b> Sana-chan's manager and confidant. Don't you dig the 
sunglasses?

<p>	<b>Mama:</b> Sana's adoptive mother. She has cool headpieces and 
drives around the house in a neat little car.

<p>	As a side note, you might be interested to know that the seiyuu who 
voiced Sana is Chisa Yokoyama, who also plays Sasami from <i>Tenchi Muyo</i>, 
and Rei is voiced by Maasami Kikuchi, the voice of Tenchi from <i>Tenchi 
Muyo</i> and Keiichi from <i>Ah! My Goddess</i>.

<p>	The television show is cool, too. It's even more hyper than the OAV, 
and it's a lot of fun watching Sana-chan rap in each episode. If you ever 
get a chance to watch this show, translated or not, I highly recommend it.
