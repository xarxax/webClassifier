<h3> About the Publishers</h3>

<p> Guidry &amp; Adkins, Publishers, was formed by two long-time
Burroughs fans and collectors specifically to publish the previously
uncollected works of Edgar Rice Burroughs. <b> John H. Guidry</b> is
best known in fan circles as the founder of the Edgar Rice Burroughs
Amateur Press Association (ERB-APA) and chairman of the 1988 World
Science Fiction Convention in New Orleans. <b> <a href="..%5Cpha%5Cpha.htm"> Patrick H. Adkins</a></b>
, editor of the Tarzana Project, is a professional editor and the
author of several fantasy novels. Both have been active in Burroughs
fandom since the early 1960s.<br /></p>

<p> Edgar Rice Burroughs &#8212; the creator of Tarzan and author of dozens
of wildly popular &#8220;scientific romances&#8221; set on Mars, Venus, at the
Earth&#8217;s Core, and in remote regions of this planet &#8212; was one of the
most widely read and influential writers of the Twentieth Century,
inspiring people as diverse as Carl Sagan and Jane Goodall, Arthur C.
Clarke, George Lucas, and Ronald Reagan.</p>

<p> Guidry &amp; Adkins, Publishers, is proud to announce the Tarzana
Project, a serious effort to bring into print in book form all of the
remaining unpublished and/or uncollected works of this celebrated
author.</p>

<p> <b> <i> <font color="#3333ff"> Forgotten Tales of Love and Murder</font></i></b>
&nbsp; (see above) is the opening entry in this ambitious endeavor.
Drawn from manuscripts that have been locked away a half-century and
more in the vaults of the Burroughs corporation in Tarzana, California
&#8212; and prepared with the cooperation and assistance of Danton Burroughs,
grandson of the author, and of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. &#8212; this
limited-edition hardcover is modeled on the highly collectable first
editions published during Burroughs&#8217; lifetime by A. C. McClurg and
Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc., complete with dust jacket and interior
illustrations. We believe that with tradition and textual integrity as
their hallmarks, these books will quickly assume prized places in your
collection and increase in value over the years to come.</p>

<p> If the Tarzana Project is to become a full reality, however, and
extend beyond this first book, we will need your help. We have to make <i> Forgotten Tales</i>
a success, and that means we have to reach all Burroughs fans,
collectors, and scholars who might be interested in this and future
volumes. You can help spread the word by telling your friends about us
and mentioning us in online discussion groups. (Don&#8217;t forget to include
this URL!)</p>

<p> Burroughs fans will be kept informed through the fan press and
through the Tarzana Project News Internet mailing list (see below).</p>
