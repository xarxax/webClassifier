<h4>What's this &amp; disclaimer</h4>
<p>This is a thread originally started elsewhere on the Internet regarding U.S.
poet laureate <b> Billy Collins</b> and, more specifically, his collection <b>Picnic,
Lightning</b> (Univ. of Pittsburgh Press, 1998). None of the opinions expressed
here necessarily reflect or coincide with my own views. I am unable to assume any liability whatsoever regarding the
authenticity of the names and e-mail addresses stated by the participants in the
thread.
<h4>Thread closed</h4>
<p>The tendency revealed by the thread is clear: There are those who like Mr.
Collins' poetry and there are those who don't – for reasons they have
attempted to state here at this <i>obscure website</i>, as one of you wrote –
and I'm afraid the twain shall never meet.<br>
&nbsp;<b>Thank you all for your time and effort.</b><br>
One
of my reasons for closing the thread is that there are too many departures from
factual argument for my taste. The attempts to discredit people who are
expressing a critical opinion by calling them <i>whiners</i> or <i>snobs</i> are
puzzling and reminiscent of political mudslinging ahead of elections. But then
again, I suppose, it could be said that Mr. E. Springsteen set the tone right
from the start and should not be surprised by some of the response elicited. J.B.

<h2>Polemic Rave about America’s Poet Laureate</h2>
<p>Just read some of Billy Collins. The guy is so pleasant and easy it’s no
wonder he became America’s poet laureate. Jesus Christ, what a thing to have
in a country of 250 million of which probably less than a million ever touch
shit like <i>poetry</i>. But you’ve got to have one who does it best, like The
President or Michael Jordan.</p>
<p>One who hits the popular jugular with a vengeance because he thrives,
absolutely thrives on one thing: accepted mediocrity hanging on to the
underbelly of <i>poetry</i> just enough to give you that slightly elevated feel
that, as we all know, should come with <i>poetry</i>.</p>
<p>And he’s funny! (Almost as funny as the newspaper funnies.)</p>
<p>There is no challenge. Cozying up to reading lower to middle class vernacular
and objects they are also likely to diddle with and muze over in that part of
their spare time reserved for <i>poetry</i>.</p>
<p>Like getting chased inside by a bee and calling it <i>little punk</i>: how
cute. Instant gratification guaranteed.</p>
<p>It is good that he writes, in &quot;Reincarnation and You,&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once
around is enough for me</p>
<p>Billy Collins once around is indeed enough.</p>

<p>I personally think Elias Springsteen’s take on Mr. Collins is an unfair
misrepresentation of a wonderful poet that might get America to read poetry once
again. Mr. Collins has a wonderfully sensitive sense of humor and an amazing
grasp of the contemporary American idiom.</p>

<p>Billy Collins is funny &amp; fun! Wish more of these so-called
&quot;poets&quot; were like that. Springsteen is a stick-in-the-mud and
spoilsport. And if Mr. Collins is mediocre I’m proud of my mediocrity for
liking him. Also I’d like to point out that he deals with religious matters
more deeply than one wd. assume from that reincarnation bit (read Shoveling Snow
with Buddha! from that same great vol.).</p>

<p>There is no challenge??? Hmmm... poetry &amp; challenge... seems like
conradictories. Bizarre how the snobs have to attach a challenge to something as
natural as art, poetry, etc., just to set themselves apart from others. It calls
to mind the &quot;secret handshake&quot; or the &quot;password&quot; to a club
most people would rather not be a part of to begin with.<br>
No sour grapes here. Just an eyeroll and herty chuckle at the Elias Spingsteens
of the world. No doubt, he's been on a mission to set himself apart from the
common-man popstar of the same last name ever since he first heard the question
&quot;Hey, are you related to...?&quot;</p>
<p>Follow your bliss...</p>

<p>I personally find Mr. Collins' poetry to be refreshing in a day and age where
everyone is attacked who hold to simple beliefs. Besides, poetry is personal and
beautiful and who am I to diminish the importance of anyone being willing to
open up to others. I applaud Mr. Collins for his honesty.</p>

<p>This man writes to the people not to some self-important panel of cryptic
intelectuals.</p>
<p>Billy Collins opens minds without flying over his readers' heads. He leads
his audience on a nearly free associative journey, taking imaginative, thrilling
leaps without sacrificing coherence, and he brings us to those delightful spaces
between the ordinary that we gloss over routinely.</p>

<p>Happened to stop by this &quot;controversy&quot; by accident. I suppose it's
all about where you set your standards. To me, reading Collins is sort of like
eating at MacDonald's: it's convenient, it's fast, it's relatively cheap, you
get your carbos but not all that much else. Well, this may be a bit unfair...
But please don't come down too hard on people who prefer better food... It's not
a crime to use one's brain and dare to be a little more intellectual – a
little more picky.</p>

<p>Billy Collins is accessible--he enters your mind with hum drum everyday
tasks/thoughts and manages, before he leaves you, to make you think about them
as well as your view of things in some new way--maybe only a small way--but a
new way. As a teacher myself, his poetry about teaching is spot on and really
makes one think about how and who we teach, what we teach, and why we teach.
Plus, he likes jazz.

<p>Comments: Basically, as you see it, the poet's glaring faults are that he is,
&quot;pleasant, easy and funny.&quot;</p>
<p>I find it amazing when people take exception to a poet or their poetry simply
because they snobbishly deem it &quot;easy to understand.&quot;</p>
<p>Layers of meaning yes, but difficult to understand has never been listed as a
necessary part of good poetry.</p>
<p>These same people, self-proclaimed keepers of the art&quot; indignantly rise
up in protest and carry signs listing the</p>
<p>true qualities of a &quot;real poet,&quot; as they snobbishly see it.</p>
<p>They do not waste a minute on thought, reflection or looking for a deeper
meaning before vultureisticly grabbing their sharpies and</p>
<p>poster board. They are entirely too busy scribbling the true attributes of a
poem on their protest signs.</p>
<p>Doesn't anyone understand humor, irony and wit?</p>
<p>Does everyone think poetry must to be about a silver moon, a vast ocean or a
fragrant breeze to be worthy?</p>
<p>How many, like Elias Springsteen, believe poetry must bleed to even be
considered a poem...?</p>

Stupid accessible unchallenging poetry. So what if it touches a broad group of
people. Stupid people. We need some pate here so we can feel superior.</p>

<p>I'm willing to bet my life that the whiners here are unread poets... well,
unread by anyone other than mothers who are simply being kind while hoping that
their 40 year old kid moves beyond their poetry phase and out of the basement. I
happen to like Collins... (detest Bush for what its worth) and can outread,
outreason, and outsmart any these losers who need to run down others on an
obscure website to feel worthy.</p>

<p>(August 27, 2004)<p>&quot;Billy Collins writes lovely poems,&quot; writes
John Updike. &quot;Limpid, gently and consistently startling, more serious than
they seem, they describe all the worlds that are and were and some others
besides.&quot;</p>

<p>When I come across commentary like that of E. Springsteen, it makes me
shudder.</p>
<p>Poetry is an amazingly beautiful artform. and it is something that becomes
more beautiful when its feet are on the ground.</p>
<p>I find much of comtemporary poetry to be so self-serving for the poet. Billy
Collins's work is typical of untypical,greatness. He can communicate deeply and
effectively with his readers in language all can appreciate. That is what poetry
should be. Springsteen, try reading some Butler Yeats, who Collins reminds me of
in many ways, and tell me if that is too simplistic for you?</p>
