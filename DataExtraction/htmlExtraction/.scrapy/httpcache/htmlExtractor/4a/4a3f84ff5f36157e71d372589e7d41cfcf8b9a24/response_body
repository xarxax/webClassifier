<p>

<p>
Dear Fellow Home Inspector,
<p>
Whether you're just starting out as a home inspector or if you've been a home inspector for many years, this Home 
Inspection Report Kit may be just what you have been looking for.
<p>

<img src="MP_photo3.jpg" width="94" height="128" alt="home inspector" border="0" align="left">My name is Mike Pompeii.  I am an 
experienced home inspector, have Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Engineering, 
and am a licensed Professional Engineer (P.E.).  I've also authored several popular 
books: "<a href="http"//homeinspectionbook.com">Become a Home Inspector!</a>" and 
"<a href="http://homebuildingbook.com">Build Your Own Home!</a>"  I'm telling you this because I have 
been around the block and back in the home inspection business, and I would like to share with you a 
valuable lesson that I learned along the way.
<p>
<b>Here is that lesson in a nutshell:</b>
<p>
<font face="verdana, arial" color="#ff0000" size="3"><b>What your home inspection customers REALLY want is your knowledge and expertise about homes, and this information must 
be conveyed to them in a SIMPLE and CONCISE manner. The SIMPLER, the BETTER !!!</b></font>
<p>
This means that most of your customers DON'T REALLY CARE if you use a super fancy software generated report... in fact, 
my customers actually PREFERRED a simple, handwritten report that was delivered to them ON-SITE.
<p>
Why?  Because the report was CLEAR, CONCISE, EASY TO UNDERSTAND, and they received the report 
IMMEDIATELY after the inspection.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
I'll say it another way... My customers actually DID NOT CARE if the report had photos, fancy fonts, and lots of hard 
to read text.  <b>THEY JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF ANYTHING WAS WRONG WITH THEIR HOUSE.</b>
<p>
This was great news for me. I was tired of spending 3 hours on an inspection, only to go back to the office and spend 
another HOUR messing with complicated software and generating a fancy report. With the simple hand-written report, I was 
COMPLETELY finished after my 3 hour inspection, my customer had a professional looking report in their hand, and I WAS DONE.
<p>
Just think about it:
<ul>
 <li>No more going back to the office to finish
 <li>No more time spent wrestling with complicated software
 <li>No more time spent typing in comments
 <li>No more uploading photos
 <li>No more emailing or uploading reports
 <li>No more computer hassles. 
</ul>
I actually had an EXTRA HOUR to 
spend with my wife and kids !
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>IS THERE A DOWNSIDE TO HAND-WRITTEN COMMENTS ON HOME INSPECTION REPORTS?</b>
<p>
The answer is... it depends.  It depends on the type of report that you use, the format of the report, and how 
neatly you can write or print. Let's look at this in more detail.
<p>
<u>REPORT TYPE</u><br>
If you are going to use a report with hand-written comments, my experience says that a report that has both a CHECKLIST 
and a NARRATIVE section is best. The checklist helps to guide you through the inspection and to not miss anything.  The 
narrative section lets you describe whatever you find.
<p>
And, of course, the report must present a professional appearance. This can be done by: 1) formatting and organizing the 
checklists and narrative sections in a simple and straightforward manner, and 2) printing neatly.
<p>
<center>
<font face="verdana, arial" color="red" size="3"><b><i><u>NEWSFLASH:</u></i><p>
YOU DO NOT NEED A FANCY, COMPUTER-GENERATED HOME INSPECTION 
REPORT IN ORDER TO PRESENT A PROFESSIONAL IMAGE !!!</b></font>
</center>
<p>
If you can print letters and words neatly, then a report with handwritten comments is definitely for you.  Being an engineer 
and former draftsman, I could write comments in very neat block letters in my home inspection reports.
<p>
But what if you can't write or print neatly, no matter how hard you try? A handwritten report with scribbles and hard-to-read 
words just does not present a professional image.  You have several options here:  Either practice writing neatly until 
you can do it well, or you must use a computer-generated report or software.
<p>
I've always used block lettering in my reports because it is consistent and easy to read.  Block lettering is simply writing 
in all capital letters, and is simple to practice and easy to get good at it.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>BUT I THOUGHT THAT SOFTWARE AND COMPUTERS WERE SUPPOSED TO MAKE THINGS EASIER ?</b>
<p>
That's what I thought, too. But in the home inspection business, I found this to be simply not true.  Software and computers 
definitely make MANY things in life and business easier, but in my experience, NOT when it comes to home inspection reports!
<p>
I learned this lesson the hard way by spending a lot of time and a lot of money experimenting with different types of 
home inspection software and different types of checklist-type reports.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>SO WHAT ABOUT THE CHECKLIST-TYPE OF HOME INSPECTION REPORTS OUT THERE NOW?</b>
<p>
There are many types of excellent home inspection reports that are available, but most have several MAJOR DOWNFALLS that really 
turned me off... 
<ul>
 <li>Too much info is jammed into too little space.
 <li>The fonts are too small and hard to read.
 <li>You have to pay about $8 to $20 PER REPORT !!
</ul>
<p>
I can't believe that some home inspectors actually pay these fees for each and every report they use.  If you do 100 inspections 
per year, that's an extra <b>$800 to $2,000</b> out of your pocket. If you do 500 inspections per year, that's a whopping <b>$4,000 to 
$10,000</b> out of your pocket !!!
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<font size="3"><b>THERE IS A BETTER WAY...</b></font>
<p>
This HOME INSPECTION REPORT KIT solves ALL of these issues, and is available for you to purchase and use.

<p>
I developed and refined this HOME INSPECTION REPORT KIT over the course of many years and many home inspections.  It's simple, 
neatly formatted, and very effective. It also saves you precious time AND money.
<p>
Best of all, my customers and their realtors SIMPLY LOVE THIS REPORT, without exception.  Why?  Because it conveys 
all the important information in a CLEAR and CONCISE manner and the customer and realtor don't have to wait hours or days 
for the report. They receive the report ON-SITE.
<p>
<b>Here's what others say:</b>
<p>

<p>
"I was a little skeptical at first, but after giving the report a try, I have to tell you that I am now hooked."<br />
