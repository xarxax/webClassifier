<b>3/15/13 -- Mass Effect Cowboy Bebop shout-out</b> - Man it's been so long since I updated I don't even have Dreamweaver installed anymore, 
I'm using a damn text editor. Anyway, been playing the greatest game ever made, which I'll be honest I didn't like much after the ending was released, 
but it has fully redeemed itself with the newly released DLC, Citadel. I'm talking bout some Mass Effect 3 over here. Steve Blum was good enough to take 
the opportunity to do a Cowboy Bebop shoutout during the DLC, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5duCOoL2mVQ">I have uploaded it</a> for 
your pleasure.<br>

<br>

<b>2/5/09 -- Restoration</b> - I re-uploaded <a href="http://www.cowboybebop.org">cowboybebop.org</a> and started paying the hosting fee 
again. It seemed appropriate since they're making a live action version.  This way people searching for information about "that new Keanu 
Reeves film", they might accidentally find out about an awesome anime instead.<br>
<br>  

<b>12/17/08 -- Your Neutralness, it's a beige alert.</b> - <a 
href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-01-15/live-action-cowboy-bebop-proposal-officially-announced">Live action Cowboy Bebop 
has been officially confirmed.</a>  If I don't survive, tell my wife hello. <br>
<br>  

<b>12/17/08 -- Bogus adventure.</b> - Ain't it cool news has an <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/39486">interview with Keanu 
"Stone Face" Reeves about the upcoming live action adaptation of Cowboy Bebop</a>. So its looking more and more as though that, barring 
Keanu's succumbing to his long struggle with Tetanus, live action Cowboy Bebop is go. Boo.<br>
<br>  

<b>8/1/08 -- Party on, dudes?</b> - Sorry I'm a bit late with this update, surely everyone has heard by now that 
there is a <a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2008/07/22/fox-developing-cowboy-bebop-live-action-feature-film/">live action 
Cowboy Bebop</a> on the way.  This news has been reported in several places and for now seem legit. To be 
perfectly honest, this news doesn't really fill me with glee, because I expect it to be miscast, misdirected, and 
all around screwed with in ways not befitting it's legend. The first sign that perhaps Fox doesn't quite get 
Cowboy Bebop is that <a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2008/07/30/rumor-keanu-reeves-as-spike-in-cowboy-bebop-movie/">Keanu 
Reeves is set to star as Spike</a>.  Thanks to SXS for the article on the casting.  <a 
href="http://www.comics2film.com/index.php?a=gallery_item&l=5958">Remember SXS</a>?<br><br>
