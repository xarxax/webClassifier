<!-- science fiction book review -->

<span class=norm>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
     <span class=gray>Shadow of the Giant</span> is the ninth book in Orson Scott Card's 
     hugely successful Ender universe and the fourth to focus on Ender's friend Bean.&nbsp; In 
     my view, <span class=gray>Shadow of the Giant</span> is the best of the four Bean 
     novels.&nbsp; Absorbing both intellectually and emotionally, it is a very satisfying 
     wrap-up to the near-future Bean sequence.&nbsp; (Card leaves the door open for another 
     book in the Bean sequence, but much further in the future.)</span>
   
    <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.4in">
    <span class=gray>Shadow of the Giant</span> is not intended to stand alone.&nbsp; At 
    a minimum, you should read either <span class=gray>Ender's Game</span> or <span class=gray>Ender's 
    Shadow</span>, if not all three prior Bean books - <span class=gray>Ender's Shadow</span>, 
    <span class=gray>Shadow of the Hegemon</span>, and <span class=gray>Shadow Puppets</span> - 
    before attempting it.</p>
    
    <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.4in">
    The Ender books all follow a group of very gifted children who were sent at an extremely young 
    age to an orbiting Battle School and trained for military command, in hopes they would find a 
    way to defeat mankind's powerful alien enemies the Buggers.&nbsp; Ender Wiggin, Battle School's 
    top student, was the star of the first four novels in the series (<span class=gray>Ender's Game</span>, 
    <span class=gray>Speaker for the Dead</span>, <span class=gray>Xenocide</span>, and 
    <span class=gray>Children of the Mind</span>) as well as <span class=gray>First Meetings</span>, a 
    collection of related short stories.&nbsp; The four subsequent novels (in terms of when they were 
    published, not internal chronology &#8211; see my review of <a href="shadow_puppets.htm">Shadow Puppets</a> 
    for a complete explanation of how the books fit together chronologically) have focused on 
    Bean, a.k.a Julian Delphiki, Ender's friend and lieutenant at Battle School.&nbsp; The books starring 
    Ender began very powerfully with <span class=gray>Ender's Game</span> and <span class=gray>Speaker 
    for the Dead</span>, which both won the Hugo and Nebula Awards, then lost some of their narrative 
    drive.&nbsp; The Bean sequence is following the opposite pattern, starting a bit slowly but gathering 
    momentum.</p>
    
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.4in"><span class=gray>Shadow of the Giant</span> takes place in the aftermath 
   of the Bugger Wars on a mostly recognizable, near-future Earth.&nbsp; (Card intentionally glosses 
   over the fact that the Bugger Wars and other prior events he has described actually would 
   have needed centuries to play out.)&nbsp; Still only some 16 years old, Bean has grown to enormous 
   size &#8211; picture a very articulate version of pro wrestler Andre the Giant &#8211; due to the same 
   genetic alteration that made him so brilliant.&nbsp; His body cannot sustain the continuing growth, 
   and Bean knows he does not have long to live.</p>
    
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.4in">
   Bean is striving to help Ender's brother Peter Wiggin forge a peaceful and effective world 
   government under Peter's leadership as Hegemon.&nbsp; Their efforts are hindered, however, by various 
   expansionist nations, including China, India, Russia, and a newly united Muslim conglomerate, all 
   with their own ideas of who should run the world.&nbsp; Let us hope that Card is being cynical in 
   his expectation that every powerful nation in the future - excepting the U.S. and Western 
   Europe, which have become withdrawn and isolationist - will seek to dominate the others.&nbsp; His 
   portrayal of the Muslim world is particularly unflattering and some readers may find it 
   offensive, but in my view Islam has an awful lot of house cleaning to do before it can 
   legitimately complain about being portrayed as a bloodthirsty religion.&nbsp; (Card is very 
   opinionated in general about politics, as you will see if you visit his "Ornery" political 
   web site, but his apparent sympathy for a world government with real authority belies the 
   label of ultraconservative some have pinned on him.)</p>
    
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.4in">Several of the nations competing for power are emboldened by 
   the fact that they have their own former Battle Schoolers, in particular Han Tzu (known 
   to Battle Schoolers as Hot Soup) in China, Virlomi in India, and Alai among the 
   Muslims.&nbsp; These Battle Schoolers are very useful to their home nations both for the 
   ingenious battle plans they can devise and for the devotion they inspire among hero-worshipping 
   citizens and soldiers.&nbsp; (In Virlomi's case, the people have come to worship her in 
   a literal sense.)&nbsp; As <span class=gray>Shadow of the Giant</span> begins, they are being 
   used as pawns by their governments' leaders.&nbsp; But the leaders forget that if you don't 
   keep an eye on pawns, they may reach the end of the board and become queens, and several 
   of the Battle Schoolers soon attempt to turn the tables on their controllers.</p>
    
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.4in">One of the strengths of <span class=gray>Shadow of the 
   Giant</span> is that it takes us inside the minds of these other Battle Schoolers, who 
   were interesting but minor characters in the earlier books.&nbsp; Card spends the time to show 
   us events from their different viewpoints, and manages to do it without disrupting the 
   story's brisk pace.&nbsp; These Battle Schoolers are all well intentioned yet also very 
   ambitious.&nbsp; This creates fascinating internal struggles for each of them, driving one 
   of them nearly to insanity, and is an interesting commentary on the correlation between 
   ability and ambition.</p>
    
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.4in">In the midst of these geopolitical struggles, a more personal 
   drama confronts Bean and his wife Petra, also a former Battle Schooler.&nbsp; They are 
   obsessed with finding the embryos they created in <span class=gray>Shadow Puppets</span>, 
   knowing Bean would not survive long, which Bean's old nemesis Achilles stole and 
   implanted in various women hidden around the world.&nbsp; If they can find these newborn 
   children, Bean and Petra have a desperate plan to get on a lightspeed spaceship so 
   that relativity will carry them to a future when a cure for Bean's condition has been 
   found.&nbsp; Bean isn't telling Petra that his intention is to take the trip without her, 
   along with whichever of their children share his condition, so that Petra and the 
   unaffected children can remain and lead a normal life.&nbsp; While this makes little 
   sense logically (if either of them believes that a cure will ever be found, then 
   they can make the jump into the future together, and all settle down to a normal 
   life after they get there - this is the kind of internal inconsistency that Card 
   was more careful to avoid earlier in his career), Card skillfully portrays the emotional 
   impact on Bean and Petra of the difficult choices they face.</p>
    

<span class=norm>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   Card also gives us new insight into the once vicious 
   but gradually softening character of Peter Wiggin.&nbsp; For example, it comes out that 
   part of the reason Peter was such a lousy big brother to Ender was that he was hurt 
   and enraged as a child that Ender loved their sister Valentine more than Peter.&nbsp; Without 
   intending it, he atones for this by finally marrying a woman he knows loves another 
   more than she will ever love him.&nbsp; This may seem quite a sacrifice, but Peter 
   probably does not think it a sacrifice to share his life with the woman he 
   loves.&nbsp; These are the kind of accommodations and compromises that life imposes 
   upon us all.&nbsp; We human beings are flawed, yet also noble all in our own 
   ways.&nbsp; Orson Scott Card understands this, and that is what makes him a great writer.</span>
