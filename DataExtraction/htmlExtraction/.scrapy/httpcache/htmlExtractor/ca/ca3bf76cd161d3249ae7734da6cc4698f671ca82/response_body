<P><FONT COLOR="#804000">One of the first writers to describe Irish music
was the twelfth-century cleric Giraldus Cambrensis (which means &quot;Gerald
of Wales&quot;). It's very interesting to scholars of this subject to have
such an early source, but on the other hand, it would have been even more
interesting if it were clear exactly what he meant by some of the things
he said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#804000">In general Giraldus was very critical of the Irish,
saying that they were a bunch of idle louts who spent their time lazing
about and growing their hair long, which makes him sound rather like a
critic of the Sixties &quot;counterculture&quot;. His positive comments
on Irish music are the exception to his general attitude.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#804000">One item in his writings which is especially interesting
is that he seems to be describing the first known use of harmony, and he
says it is found mainly in Wales and northern England. It has always been
a puzzle why European music went off in a harmonic direction while other
music in other cultures did not, and how it all got started. Giraldus's
statement is a valuable clue, but unfortunately a rather ambiguous one.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#804000">To mention what else is known on this subject
(which is very little indeed), it appears that in the Scandinavian-influenced
parts of Britain there existed a singing style called <I>gymel</I>, which
is basically harmony in parallel thirds. A twelfth-century manuscript found
in Uppsala, Sweden gives a hymn to St. Magnus, <I>Nobilis ,humilis</I>,
in the Lydian mode and harmonized in parallel thirds. Since St. Magnus
is the patron saint of Orkney (which was Norse at that period), it is generally
assumed to have come from there. This would tend to confirm what Giraldus
seems to be saying.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#804000">On the other hand, it seems to me that he may
have been describing the type of heterophonic group singing that is still
heard today in the singing of Gaelic psalms. In that case, each singer
sings the same melody line at an individual tempo, and with individual
and ornate ornamentation, but all start and end each line on the same note.
In between, there are a number of independent melody lines in progress,
but not what could be described as &quot;harmony&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#804000">When Europe as a whole started in on harmony,
they used <I>organum </I>which consists of parallel fourths or fifths,
and generally avoided the use of thirds. So it's not obvious that the concept
of <I>organum </I>grew out of <I>gymel</I>,<I> </I>which used <U>only </U>thirds.
(In fact, with the Pythagorean tuning system that was in use at that time,
thirds tend to be out of tune.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#804000">However, the English appear to have been fond
of thirds, and when the use of the third was adopted by the Burgundian
school of composers a few centuries later, it seems to have been as a result
of English influence, in part the <I>faux-bourdon</I>, which adds the interval
of a third to parallel fourths, resulting in parallel first-inversion triads.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#804000">I've included a quotation from Joan Rimmer which
I cited elsewhere, and also some material posted on rec.music.early by
Margo Schulter, to whom I'm very grateful for doing all that work.</FONT></P>

During the first millenium of the Christian era, western Europe knew nothing of
harmony as we connote this term. All music, whether secualr or religious, was
homophonic. Certainly the melody was often doubled at the octave by magadizing,
which was an art known as <I>symphonia</I>, fully described by early theorists.
When the fourth and fifth, and later the third, were admitted in a like manner, a
decided advance was apparent, and this new artifice was named <I>organum</I>.
Despite Arabic clues, it is not unlikely that the first prompting among
Occidental peoples for this diversion, for such it must have been primarily,
came from Britain, and one of the hints in this detection is the illusive passage
in the <I>Topographia Hibernica</I> (<I>c</I>. 1185) of Giraldus Cambrensis.
It deals with the harp-playing of the Irish and seems to point to the simultaneous
use of fourths and fifths. Much clearer and more precise is the passage in the same
writer's Itinerarium Cambriae, where he says that the Welsh &quot;do not sing in
unison like the people of other lands, but sing in different parts.&quot; He also observes
that the people of North Britain, &quot;beyond the Humber,&quot; use &quot;a similar kind of
harmony ... singing only in parts, one ... in the bass, the other ... in the treble.&quot;
Giraldus hints that this novelty was due to Scandinavian influence, on which account
some writers urge that Scandinavia was the <I>point de d&eacute;part</I> of this
novelty, to which proof they bring forward the 13th century Upsala manuscript
which shows the use of parallel thirds throughout. Against this there is the earlier
evidence of the 12th century Cornish manuscript in the Bodleian Library,
whilst reference to the so-called Anonymous IV manuscript (<I>c</I>.1273-80),
where the use of thirds is said to be used mostly in the &quot;[Celtic] west of
England,&quot; seems to strengthen the British claim.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#008000">The Medieval Irish Harp</FONT></H2>

<P><IMG SRC="image/feastc.gif" ALT="Irish feast" HEIGHT=307 WIDTH=389 ALIGN=RIGHT>In
1183, Giraldus de Barri, the Welsh-born Norman ecclesiastic whose family
was heavily involved in the conquest of Ireland, paid his first visit to
that country. He returned in 1185 with the English Prince John to whom
he had by then become tutor. His enthusiastic comments on music and harp-playing
in Ireland, written in Latin which is difficult both to translate and to
interpret, have often been quoted, but no completely satisfactory elucidation
has yet been arrived at. If, however, Giraldus's text is studied in conjunction
with what is known of twelfth-century musical practice and with what is
known quite precisely and unequivocally about the nature of the Irish harp
as a sound-maker, it becomes less enigmatic.</P>

<P>Giraldus went to Paris in 1167 and stayed there until 1172, studying
the Latin poets, law, philosophy and theology. As a cleric, he must have
been familiar with plainsong and, at least to some extent, with the practice
of polyphony as it was used in the Church's liturgy. He must also have
been familiar with the secular music which was played and sung in the households
of feudal lords and in the capital cities of London and Paris. His literary
and artistic standards were those of a cultivated western European ecclesiastic,
not of an out-back Norman-Welshman.</P>

<P>In his <I>Topographica Hiberniae</I>, Giraldus berated the Irish as
'barbarians' for what he considered to be their lack of industry, their
poor husbandry and disinterest in city life, their flowing beards and odd
clothes, their love of leisure and liberty. He granted them splendour of
physique and superlative skill in the practice of instrumental music. Whatever
music Giraldus heard in Ireland, it did not seem to him barbarous and peculiar;
he described it specifically as better executed and more agreeable than
that generally heard in England. Whatever its musical idiom was, it seems
to have been not far removed from that of Western Christendom, and if we
examine Giraldus's words, it appears that he tried to be as explicit as
possible in Latin, a language whose vocabulary was not geared to the expression
of musical subtleties. His section on Irish instrumental music is worth
quoting in full:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR CLEAR=ALL>
</P>

<P>I find among these people commendable diligence only on musical instruments,
on which they are incomparably more skilled than any nation I have seen.
Their style is not, as on the British instruments to which we are accustomed,
deliberate and solem but quick and lively; nevertheless the sound is smooth
and pleasant.</P>

<P>It is remarkable that, with such rapid fingerwork, the musical rhythm
is maintained and that, by unfailingly disciplined art, the integrity of
the tune is fully preserved throughout the ornate rhythms and the profusely
intricate polyphony&#151;and with such smooth rapidity, such 'unequal equality',
such 'discordant concord'. Whether the strings strike together a fourth
or a fifth, [the players] nevertheless always start from B flat and return
to the same, so that everything is rounded off in a pleasant general sonority.
They introduce and leave rhythmic motifs so subtly, they play the tinkling
sounds on the thinner strings above the sustained sound of the thicker
string so freely, they take such secret delight and caress [the strings]
so sensuously, that the greatest part of their art seems to lie in veiling
it, as if 'That which is concealed is bettered&#151;art revealed is art shamed'.</P>

<P>Thus it happens that those things which bring private and ineffable
delight to people of subtle appreciation and sharp discernment, burden
rather than delight the ears of those who, in spite of looking do not see
and in spite of hearing do not understand; to unwilling listeners, fastidious
things appear tedious and have a confused and disordered sound.</P>

<P>One must note that both Scotland and Wales, the latter by virtue of
extension, the former by affinity and intercourse, depend on teaching to
imitate and rival Ireland in musical practice. Ireland uses and delights
in two instruments only, the <I>cithara</I> and the <I>tympanum</I>. Scotland
uses three, the <I>cithara</I>, the <I>tympanum</I> and the <I>chorus</I>.
Wales uses the <I>cithara</I>, <I>tibiae</I> and <I>chorus</I>. Also, they
use strings made of brass not of leather. However, in the opinion of many,
Scotland today not only equals Ireland, her mistress, but also by far outdoes
and surpasses her in musical skill. Hence many people already look there
as though to the source of the art.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><I>Cithara</I> was a harp. <I>Tympanum</I> possibly meant a bowed or
beaten lyre, perhaps adopted from the Norsemen, for some forms of these
still survive in Scandinavia. <I>Tibiae</I> were pipes, though Giraldus
did not specify what kind. The description of musical performance obviously
refers to harp-playing; on a lyre, whether plucked or bowed, there is no
possibility of such intricacy. The Latin terms which Giraldus used cannot
be put exactly into modern musical terminology for our conception and practice
of music are greatly different from those of medieval people. His key words,
however, are all to do with particular aspects of styles of polyphonic
music as distinct from monophonic music such as plainsong and presumably
much secular vocal music of that time.</P>

<P>While the first paragraph describes the general agreeableness of Irish
performance, the second seems to describe the playing of florid elaborations
in impeccable rhythm, proportion and clarity. And we may note here that
is was precisely these qualities that Edward Bunting praised, six hundred
years later, in Denis Hempson, last of the harpers in the traditional style.
The word translated 'polyphony' is <I>organa</I>&#133; the plural of <I>organum</I>,
which denotes both a particular polyphonic technique&#151;that of adding one
florid part above a slow-moving <I>tenor</I>&#151;and a piece composed in this
technique. Explanatory translations of Giraldus's <I>organa</I> would be
'varieties of music in parts' or 'pieces of part music'. What is here translated
as <I>ornate rhythms</I> is in the original <I>crispatos modulos</I>. The
latter means literally 'measurement', <I>cantus crispus</I> is known early
in the sixteenth century in England as a term for very florid polyphony
in many parts, and its musical use is a metaphor taken from the primary
meaning of <I>crispus</I>, which is curly or quivering. Irish harpers were,
according to this account, incomparably skilled in contriving and playing
two-part music with a complex and brilliant upper part, and Giraldus, having
first described it in technical terms, reinforces this with a physical
description&#151;the tinkling of the high strings over the heavier sound of
the bass strings.</P>

<P>The curious second sentence in the second paragraph has puzzled many
scholars. The 'fourths and fifths' are exactly those intervals which generally
occur at structural points between <I>tenor</I> and added upper part in
written polyphony dating from the twelfth century. The 'starting and ending
with B flat', however, is enigmatic.</P>

NOTE: While Giraldus makes it clear that he finds the Welsh and northern
English styles of singing unique, some of the phrases he uses to describe
apt ensemble music seem to occur almost as literary conventions in the
description of Continental polyphony also. Thus one festive two-voice conductus,
<I>Annua gaudia</I> from the 12th-century repertory of Santiago de Compostella,
very possibly compiled in Northern France during the childhood years of
Giraldus, has a refrain: <I>Organa dulcia conveniencia sunt resonanda</I>,
roughly: &quot;Let resound sweet and agreeable <I>organa </I>&quot; [i.e.
&quot;organized&quot; or polyphonic songs].</P>

<P>The term <I>symphonica</I> might be translated &quot;harmoniously sounding
together,&quot; and may refer either to the <I>symphoniae</I> or concordant
intervals, such as the fourth and fifth, or more generally to the concord
of tones or voices sounding pleasantly together.</P>

<P>For a thorough study of the different meanings which can attach to the
term <I>organum</I> and allied forms in various contexts of ensemble and
instrumental music, see Peter Williams, <B><I>The Organ in Western Culture

<P><IMG SRC="image/bard.gif" ALT="Harper" HEIGHT=176 WIDTH=176 ALIGN=RIGHT>...In
each family the art of playing on the harp is held preferable to any other
learning. Their musical instruments charm and delight the ear with their
sweetness, are borne along by such celerity and delicacy of modulation,
producing such a consonance from the rapidity of seemingly discordant touches,
that I shall briefly repeat what is set forth in our Irish Topography on
the subject of the musical instruments of the three nations. It is astonishing
that in so complex and rapid a movement of the fingers, the musical proportions
can be preserved, and throughout the difficult modulations on their various
instruments, the harmony is completed with such a sweet velocity, {as if
the chords sounded together fourths or fifths. They always begin from B-flat,
and return to the same, that the whole may be completed under the sweetness
of a pleasing sound.} They enter into a movement, and conclude it in so
delicate a manner and play the little notes so sportively under the blunter
sounds of the bass strings, enlivening with wanton levity, or communicating
a deeper internal sensation of pleasure, so that the perfection of their
art appears in the concealment of it.&quot;</P>

<P>NOTE: The phrase &quot;producing such a consonance from the rapidity
of seemingly discordant touches&quot; appears to sound an interesting variation
in the description of instrumental music upon a favorite medieval definition
of harmony or polyphony as a &quot;concordant discord&quot; of simultaneous
tones or melodic lines. Two medieval synonyms for polyphony, the Greek-derived
<I>diaphonia</I> and the Latinized equivalent <I>discantus</I>, both refer
to a pleasing &quot;sounding apart&quot; or &quot;singing apart&quot; of
distinct but harmonious tones or voices.</P>

<P><BR CLEAR=ALL>
<FONT COLOR="#008000"><FONT SIZE=+2>3. An open question: &quot;the sweetness
of B-flat&quot; </FONT></FONT></P>

<P>One question raised by these passages relating to ensemble singing and
harp music alike: just what does Giraldus mean by his references to &quot;the
sweetness of B-flat&quot;? Young suggests that this could refer to the
use of B-flat in an octave-species based on F or G, avoiding the tritone;
at any rate, in the hexachord theory introduced by Guido d'Arezzo around
1130, the &quot;soft&quot; hexachord (as f-d') is distinguished by its
use of Bb rather than B-natural (both notes being integral to Guido's system).
Composed polyphonic pieces such as conductus from this same period around
1200 centering on F or G often feature the consistent use of Bb. Nevertheless,
Hughes, ibid. pp. 316-317, wisely cautions that the meaning remains uncertain.
