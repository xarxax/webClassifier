		The Telephone

	"When I was just as far as I could walk
	From here today,
	There was an hour
	All still
	When leaning with my head against a flower
	I heard you talk.
	Don't say I didn't, for I heard you say--
	You spoke from that flower on the windowsill--
	Do you remember what it was you said?"

	"First tell me what it was you thought you heard."

	"Having found the flower and driven a bee away,
	I leaned my head,
	And holding by the stalk,
	I listened and I thought I caught the word--
	What was it?  Did you call me by my name?
	Or did you say--
	<I>Someone</I> said 'Come'--I heard it as I bowed."

	"I may have thought as much, but not aloud."

	"Well, so I came."
