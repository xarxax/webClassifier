        <p><font face="Arial">Your leg hangs over me like a
        crescent moon<br>
        all clear: Your breasts breathe two small animals<br>
        behind the most exquisite Brussels lace<br>
        hey garçon: Café au lait &#150; le matin please and a
        glass of water<br>
        Basically you are like your sisters who with bobbing
        bellies<br>
        creep along the sewers anxiously listening<br>
        for the vice squad whistle and meat-eating pimps<br>
        The cattle dealer whose pants and alligator leather<br>
        wallet<br>
        you stole has taught me everything about your<br>
        soul<br>
        hey &#150; old pig: you've turned fifty but the high
        school<br>
        kids are still dreaming of you lots<br>
        They dream: you approach silently with the elastic<br>
        cane<br>
        teaching their behinds what their heart desires<br>
        hey you old lechers and white slave traders you gypsies
        and<br>
        hotel thieves<br>
        pray pray if you like that<br>
        Or drink yourselves stinko up the houses break open the <br>
        gutter<br>
        let the fire brigade thunder flush the rivers out of
        their sleep<br>
        old scum I walk towards you bottle in arm you crazy<br>
        specter<br>
        Is it you again delicious pig has the surgeon spied<br>
        your belly yet grapnel brandished torch and chloroform<br>
        Dada! Dada! only you are alive sweet love</font></p>

        The fleas will emigrate once the bets are placed<br>
        Then the country will be empty<br>
        Many more people must die of starvation<br>
        Take the executioner's sword and pierce the piss pot<br>
        Take the sun and shake your trouser leg<br>
        Everything needs to be thought over carefully<br>
        Unexpectedly the lions landed in my fireplace<br>
        Unexpectedly my head dropped onto my butt<br>
        Tarammtata rammta<br>
        The fatherland we shall love the great cheese cake<br>

                we pinch our noses to verify that we are still
                alive. A whole world lies between 1916 and 1960,
                and mankind has turned around twice on its toes
                and heels since then. From waltzes to rock and
                roll, from Cabaret Voltaire to Abstract
                Expressionism, from the Kaiser's mustache to
                Dewey's republican handlebar mustache, from the

                face="Arial">From the depths of my origins in
                Hesse and Westphalia, where the people ate, slept
                and loved because they were certain of their
                purpose and God's protective power, my existence
                has turned into something panicky, perhaps
                terrible but also something great. With the train
                of time I have moved westward from the west, and
                now I look out of my window at the New York
                skyscrapers surrounding my house near and far
                like steel mushrooms of antedeluvian origin burst
                out of the primary rock. People come and go in
                masses; this is considered progress; the lunar
                rocket is about to be launched, the democratic
                sense of smell is discovering mathematical
                geniuses among the loafers in doorways and
                corners; the girls are glad to be as thin as
                wafers. But you ask yourself: &quot;Where shall
                we end if half of mankind has dissolved in air,
                desire and nylon ... ?&quot;<br>
                ...<br>
                As Arp and I are sitting in the large living room
                of my house on Central Park in November 1958, we
                try again and again to understand the
                significance of dadaism for ourselves and for
                others. Many elements surfaced in me and in the
                Fantastic Prayers at the same time; resistance
                against the &quot;civilization&quot; we live in,
                fury about a purely factual world which leaves
                out personality and thus creative power, the
                means of irony and underlying religiousness. Ball
                turned religious during the times of dadaism, Arp
                is a religious person today, and I have always
                been one, without wanting to realize it, perhaps
                without knowing it.<br>
                Religiousness has little to do with faith as it
                is taught in church. It is no more than the
                archetypal power of experience surrounding the
                incisive universal spirit. It is the experience
                of constructive will in the world which lends
                wings to the course of the stars despite all the
                fallen angels and helps man in the course of his
                life to understand the archetypal symbols of his
                existence. And deeper than daily thought. The
                silence behind the noise is the sense of the
                Fantastic Prayers.<br>
