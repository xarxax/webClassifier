</table>Caitlin R. Kiernan&#8217;s <em>Murder of Angels</em> is earning great reviews. 
Entertainment Weekly just gave it an A-, praising the book as a &#8220;brutally 
realistic portrayal of addiction and mental illness.&#8221; <em>Murder of Angels</em> 
is a harrowing novel of love and transcendence that takes place in two worlds: 
one somewhat like our own and the other a world of mystery traditions and fantastic 
landscapes. 
<p>Since selling her first short story eleven years ago, Kiernan has had six novels 
  published, with her fiction earning acclaim on all fronts. Her first novel <em>Silk</em> 
  (1998) won the International Horror Guild&#8217;s award for First Novel and 
  Barnes and Noble&#8217;s Maiden Voyage award. <em>Silk</em> was followed by 
  <em>Threshold</em>, <em>Low Red Moon</em> and the release of her long-delayed 
  first novel <em>The Five of Cups</em>. </p>
<p>Along with the novels, Kiernan wrote for DC Vertigo&#8217;s <em>The Dreaming</em> 
  from 1997 to the series conclusion in 2001 and her short fiction has been collected 
  in <em>Tales of Pain and Wonder</em>, <em>From Weird and Distant Shores</em>, 
  and <em>Wrong Things</em> (written with Poppy Z. Brite). Upcoming projects include 
  a short story collection called <em>To Charles Fort, With Love</em>, and the 
  soon-to-be-released dark science fiction novella <em>The Dry Salvages</em>.</p>
<p>A vertebrate paleontologist, Caitlin R. Kiernan uses that training to render 
  the worlds, deep time and vast cosmos of her work with scientific precision. 
  The clarity, intelligence and insistent pull of her words and characters have 
  been praised by Peter Straub, Charles de Lint, Poppy Z. Brite and many others, 
  with Neil Gaiman calling her &#8220;the poet and bard of the wasted and the 
  lost.&#8221; Her website is <a href="http://www.caitlinrkiernan.com">Caitlinrkiernan.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>You've been talking about a sort-of-sequel to <em>Silk</em> for at 
  least four years. Was <em>Murder of Angels</em> a tough book to write?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it was an extraordinarily tough book to write. I've never written a book 
  that was easy to write, and I doubt I ever shall. <em>Silk</em> took me more 
  than three years, though it wasn't particularly difficult. But then <em>Threshold</em> 
  was a nightmare, and I was sick, physically ill, most of the time I was writing 
  it. Then I started <em>Murder of Angels</em> in the summer of 2000, got two 
  chapters in, and it just completely stalled out on me. I fought with it until 
  the following spring, when I finally gave up. I shelved it, and in 2002, in 
  only about eight months, I did <em>Low Red Moon</em>. That's the closest I've 
  come to doing an &quot;easy&quot; novel. It wasn't easy. It was difficult as 
  hell, but it just kept coming, and suddenly it was done. And I think it fooled 
  me into thinking I could do that again, write a novel in only eight months. 
  So I signed a two-book deal with Penguin, for <em>Low Red Moon</em> and <em>Murder 
  of Angels</em>. In September 2002, I pulled <em>Murder</em> down off the shelf, 
  dusted it off, read through the hundred or so pages I'd done, tossed out a chapter 
  I couldn't use, and figured I'd have it finished by the end of June, at the 
  latest. Wrong. </p>
<p>Right from the start, I was back into all the old problems I'd had with the 
  book: writing a sequel that simultaneously was and wasn't a sequel, that could 
  stand on its own but connect with the people who'd liked <em>Silk</em>; allowing 
  the book to go into more fantastic territory, which I'd always planned for it 
  to do; working through a lot of very, very personal problems that I try to deal 
  with in the book. The last was the worst problem. <em>Murder</em> was more than 
  a year of intense self analysis, I think. Me as Niki. Me as Daria. Me as Spyder. 
  Having to be these three women, all broken bits of me, and face them every day. 
  I was not a nice person to be around. The summer of 2003 was a very dark time 
  around here. I almost gave up on the book more than once that summer. I threatened 
  to burn the print-outs and erase all the files on my hard drive. I fucking hated 
  that goddamn book. It was like having to spend every day sitting in front of 
  a mirror, vivisecting my own brain. And all the time I'm thinking, no one's 
  going to get this book. They're going to hate it. It's too weird. It's going 
  to get awful reviews. I didn't finish it until December 2003. It took just a 
  little longer to write than <em>Silk</em>, which I guess is appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think <em>Murder of Angels</em> compares to your other novels? 
  </strong></p>
<p> I can't really answer that question. I still think that <em>Low Red Moon</em> 
  is my best book so far, at least it's my favorite. But lots of people disagree 
  with me, and some of them are a bit brighter than me. I'd say, <em>Murder of 
  Angels</em> is probably my most ambitious book so far, and it's some of my most 
  honest writing, and it might serve to give readers a fair idea of where I'm 
  headed as a writer.</p>
<p><strong>For the unaware, as Caitlin, could you please describe Nar'eth. </strong></p>
<p>Let's see. Nar'eth is the person I sometimes wish that I were. Or she's the 
  person I really am inside. She's a rouge Nebari bounty hunter and arms smuggler, 
  outwardly amoral, inwardly anything but. She's a full-fledged alter-ego that 
  started out as a costume, a costume that came about because I fell in love with 
  the TV series <em>Farscape</em> and then let a friend dare me I wouldn't do 
  something as unprofessional as show up in full Nebari make-up at an SF convention 
  where I was a guest. But now she's become this whole other thing. I think there 
  are people who know who Nar'eth is, but have no idea who Caitl&iacute;n R. Kiernan 
  is, which is actually kind of cool. She's a practice in pop-culture shamanism. 
  She's a way of stepping almost entirely out of myself and letting go for a day 
  or so. It's not easy, which is probably a good thing. I spend four hours in 
  a make-up chair, wear uncomfortable black contact lenses that severely impair 
  my vision, ten-pound leg shields, a steel-boned leather corset that restricts 
  my breathing. The airbrushed make-up is completely sweat-proof and has to be 
  removed with isopropyl alcohol. When the whole process is done, there's no exposed 
  skin anywhere on me, and it's hot as hell in there. But, regardless of all this, 
  here's this new being looking back at me, and it's one of the few things I do 
  these days that I could describe as fun. I think there might be more than a 
  handful of my peers who see me doing this and look at me even more askance than 
  they did before, but they can get over it. Or not. Whatever. Anyone who wants 
  to know more about Nar'eth should visit <a href="http://www.nebari.net">Nebari.net</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Despite this fun streak (and your ritual of Friday Night Kid Night 
  which involves B-movies, videogames and comfort food), your work embodies a 
  fierce responsibility to the reader and characters who often face difficult 
  personal transformations. How did you acquire such perseverance and passion? 
  Have you always been an intense and disciplined person or was there a turning 
  point where the life you were living and, in effect, your writing became more 
  serious? </strong></p>
<p>I wasn't such a dire child. That didn't begin until high school, when I started 
  having serious issues with things like faith, popularity, and gender identity. 
  That was where things began to slip, I suspect. But I've always been very passionate, 
  something of a perfectionist, and I think all the years I spent working as a 
  paleontologist, especially the time doing fossil excavation in the field and 
  preparation in the lab, helped nurture that. Doing such precise, difficult, 
  demanding work. If you're preparing a seventy million year old bone and screw 
  up, that's it. That thing survived for fucking eons and can be destroyed by 
  a second's carelessness. </p>
<p>It never even occurred to me not to approach writing with the same intensity 
  and focus. There's very little I don't approach with intensity. I mean, if it's 
  worth noticing at all, it's probably worth taking seriously. I'm sick of watching 
  dispassionate people who may as well be zombies, shuffling indifferently from 
  Point A to Point B, consuming crap and producing crap. I think my writing is 
  a fairly accurate reflection of who I am, what I've lived through, of who I 
  want to be. I've survived things that I shouldn't have, that no one should have 
  to survive: divorces, a lover's suicide, discrimination so pernicious and inescapable 
  that it entirely altered the course of my life, gender dysphoria and gender 
  reassignment, an alcoholic stepfather, physical and psychological abuse, drug 
  addiction, life in the South, and eight years of college. But, understand, I'm 
  emphatically not saying, &quot;Oh, please pity me for my difficulties and misfortune. 
  I've been victimized.&quot; Not in my fiction or in real life. Instead, I'm 
  saying, &quot;This is what I've seen out there. This is what I've experienced. 
  This is how bad it can get, and as a writer it is my responsibility to try and 
  relate these experiences.&quot; I don't know. No, I was not always so disciplined 
  or serious, intense or passionate, but now I am. It's what has come of being 
  alive, which, I should point out, wasn't my idea in the first place, so it's 
  how I approach writing.</p>
<p><strong>Allen Ginsberg believed that, while touching himself and reading &quot;Ah 
  Sunflower&quot; in 1948, the actual William Blake came and spoke to him. If 
  the world is indeed that complex, and H. P. Lovecraft chose to visit you, what 
  would you say to him?</strong></p>
<p>That I was very sorry that he had to live the last part of his life in such 
  absolute, terrible poverty and that he was not truly appreciated until long 
  after his death. Twice now, I've gone to Providence and visited the places where 
  he lived and worked, visited his grave, and there's always such a sense of sadness 
  to these trips. And yet, I read the letters he was writing at the time, towards 
  the end, and Lovecraft seems to have had an ability to carry himself with dignity 
  in the face of very demeaning circumstances and to see silver linings where 
  I'd have only seen doom and futility. So, I would also say to him how much I 
  admire that ability in him and how much I have envied it. But I suspect the 
  best I can do is to continue to draw attention to his influence on my own work 
  and to continue to insist that anyone who wants to seriously approach reading 
  or writing dark fantasy must read Lovecraft repeatedly. Occasionally, I will 
  also leave something on his headstone, usually a small plastic frog. </p>
<p> <strong><em>Memento mori</em>, or at least what Franz Kafka broached when 
  he said, &quot;The meaning of life is that it stops,&quot; is present throughout 
  your work. How does this help to tell your stories? </strong></p>
<p>I don't know that it helps me tell my stories. Instead, I'd say it's one of 
  the reasons that I'm telling stories. We seem to be at a point in history where 
  society, at least Western society, is more intent on ignoring the reality of 
  death than ever before. We wage wars, but never see the bodies. Our government 
  doesn't want us to see the bodies. Everyone knows that death is always right 
  here with us, sure as our shadows, but most people seem to exist in a perpetual 
  state of denial. It's as though they believe that it'll never happen to them 
  if only they ignore it hard enough, or maybe they think that acknowledging it 
  as a part of day-to-day existence will somehow devalue their lives. Don't get 
  me wrong. Death scares the piss out of me, which is probably another reason 
  it figures so prominently in what I write. But I've been staring it in the face 
  since I was a kid. Few things terrify me so much as the end of consciousness, 
  which is what I fear that death may be. But I don't know how to stop thinking 
  about death, any more than I know how to stop thinking about life. So, I look 
  for the beauty and the wonder and the horror in it and then try to celebrate 
  those things, which seems a whole lot healthier than cowering in fear or pretending 
  that I'll live forever.</p>
<p><strong>How are the branching outcomes, actions done and not done and their 
  effects on worldlines, integral to <em>Murder of Angels</em>? </strong></p>
<p>This has been a recurring theme throughout my work, probably from the very 
  start. History is this amazingly strange thing. And the more physicists learn 
  about space and time, the stranger history becomes. I'm obsessed with &quot;the 
  road not taken,&quot; as Frost said. Change just one little thing, and it all 
  comes out differently. History is so unfathomably complex that we can hardly 
  begin to grasp the importance of our least significant actions upon the whole. 
  Nothing anyone ever does is negligible. In the case of <em>Silk</em> and <em>Murder 
  of Angels</em>, I'm always asking myself questions like, what if Niki hadn't 
  dealt so poorly with the news that Danny Boudreaux was a transsexual? What if 
  she'd never gone to Birmingham? What if her car hadn't broken down there? What 
  if Daria had never picked up her boyfriend's bass? What if Spyder's father hadn't 
  been a lunatic? What if Scarborough Pentecost hadn't died in Spyder's house 
  [in <em>Low Red Moon</em>]. What would have happened in that other world, if 
  that other world actually exists? What if Niki had been better at committing 
  suicide? What if Daria had never become a successful musician? Reshuffle the 
  cards and you'll deal a different hand. The multiverse contains an infinite 
  number of recombinations. And it's this fact that underlies much of <em>Murder 
  of Angels</em>. From the beginning, I refused to allow myself to know how the 
  book would end. That would be determined by each and every decision I made through 
  the proxy of the characters, another act of shamanism. It all could have gone 
  another way. In other worldlines, I'm sure it did. There are universes where 
  I wrote books wherein Niki fought the Dragon or where the Dragon reached our 
  world or where Niki and Daria never became lovers, books wherein Spyder never 
  went insane. But here, now, this is what happened. I never cease to find that 
  fascinating, that the end result is never inevitable.</p>
<p><strong>In a previous interview, you said that you think people can consciously 
  lead themselves to moments of awe and that reality may be, at best, an illusion 
  -- even implying that chaos theory and quantum physics are scarier than the 
  things you dream up. Is your work an intentional attempt to challenge and explore 
  comfortable assumptions of reality? </strong></p>
<p>Oh, I think it's absolutely true that chaos theory and quantum physics are 
  scarier, and weirder, things than anything I could ever dream up. This is the 
  fact that lies at the root of all good dark fiction, that fiction that often 
  gets labeled Lovecraftian because Lovecraft kept pointing this out. We are brilliant, 
  fleeting dust specks adrift in an incomprehensible and probably indifferent 
  matrix of subatomic particles and atoms and organisms and planets and solar 
  systems and galaxies and universes and timelines. But yes, I would say that 
  a lot of what I'm doing is trying to get people to at least question their perceptions 
  of &quot;reality.&quot; I'm not so ambitious as to think I can lead anyone to 
  expand his or her consciousness, and consciousness is the fundamental unit of 
  individual reality. But I can at least try to instill a little doubt. </p>
<p>I'm annoyed at how many people read <em>Murder of Angels</em> and quickly draw 
  conclusions about the relationship between Spyder's insanity and the existence 
  of the world of the Dragon and the red witches. Did Spyder create it from her 
  own psychocosm? Was it there all along and somehow she became conscious of it 
  as a child? Is this really somehow the result of Niki's schizophrenia? Was Spyder 
  right about the Nephilim, even without knowing it? These are all perfectly good 
  questions that the book may be asking, but if you allow yourself to settle on 
  one then I'm afraid you've missed the point. People hate uncertainty. They want 
  to know &quot;what happened.&quot; But for me it's always the questions, and 
  the act of asking the questions, of figuring out how to formulate the questions, 
  that's really interesting. Truth, if such a thing actually exists, strikes me 
  as a dead end. That all sounds very arrogant, I know, but it's meant just the 
  opposite. All I'm saying is that I don't know anything.</p>
<p><strong>On August 3rd of this year (at <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/greygirlbeast/">http://www.livejournal.com/users/greygirlbeast/</a>) 
  you discussed why your novels, chapbooks and collections have been dedicated 
  to Elizabeth Tillman Aldridge. Her suicide was obviously a great personal loss 
  and something you waited nine years to discuss publicly. What has it been like 
  to unearth this secret and how does this tie in to her influence on your work?</strong></p>
<p>I've never talked about this in an interview before. I hadn't planned on ever 
  talking about it publicly, not beyond the dedications in my books. Then, a day 
  or two before this most recent anniversary of her death, I decided I'd talk 
  about it <a href="http://www.caitlinrkiernan.com/2004_08_01_lowredmoon_archive.html">in the blog</a>. And I didn't let myself talk myself out of doing it. Her 
  death in 1995, just as I was beginning to be recognized as an author, changed 
  everything about my life. Everything. When I found out what had happened, that 
  she was gone, that was one of my first thoughts &#8212; Everything is changed 
  forever. Whatever was going to happen, her decision made this happen, instead. 
  Sometimes that has made me very angry. And yes, I wish she were here. But I 
  won't condemn her for making the choice she made. I know it's all far too complicated 
  to allow myself to think like that. </p>
<p>As for my work, I think it's fairly evident that she's one of the things I've 
  been writing about over and over for years. Her death determined the ending 
  of <em>Silk</em>, and she's the reason I needed to create Salmagundi Desvernine, 
  and the reason that Jimmy DeSade became such a bastard, and the reason <em>Low 
  Red Moon</em> is such a unrelentingly harsh novel. I think <em>Low Red Moon</em> 
  was an attempt to deal with her death, once and for all and be done with it. 
  I'd heard a line from Poe's song &quot;Haunted&quot; &#8212; &quot;Time to gather 
  up the splinters, Build a casket for my tears&quot; &#8212; and it was always 
  at the heart of that book. And I did work through a lot of my grief in <em>Low 
  Red Moon</em>, but it's not a casket. I know now that there's never going to 
  be a casket. <em>Murder of Angels</em> is, in part, my acknowledgement that 
  memory, not forgetting, is the way I'll deal with Elizabeth's death. There. 
  That's the hardest question I've ever had to answer in an interview. You better 
  print every word.</p>
<p><strong>Having written six novels, forty-eight comic scripts, at least sixty 
  short stories -- even singing for a goth band at one point -- what would you 
  say to someone who is just discovering your work?</strong></p>
<p>Well, it's probably not what you're expecting. I'd say that. And I'd say please, 
  please, please give it a chance, work with me. I don't write books or stories 
  that are meant to be passively consumed. And if you keep coming back, I'd say 
  thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, all else being equal, how would Nar'eth see Caitlin? </strong></p>
<p> I think Nar'eth would find Caitl&iacute;n utterly perplexing, frustrating, 
  occasionally infuriating. She wouldn't ever have the patience for Caitl&iacute;n. 
  Nar'eth acts, and Caitl&iacute;n dithers. Nar'eth would think I waste too damn 
  much time on foolishness and propriety. She'd be furious at the amount of crap 
  I take off people, and she'd definitely be of the opinion that I ought to write 
  less and get out more often. That's how Nar'eth would see Caitl&iacute;n, I 
  think.<br>
