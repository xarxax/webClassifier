<h3>PART I</h3>
<UL><DL>
<P>
<!--FL--><DT>'T is the middle of night by the castle clock
<DT>And the owls have awakened the crowing cock;
<DD>  Tu-whit!- Tu-whoo!
<DT>And hark, again! the crowing cock,
<DD>  How drowsily it crew.
<DT>Sir Leoline, the Baron rich,
<DT>Hath a toothless mastiff, which
<DT>From her kennel beneath the rock
<DT>Maketh answer to the clock,
<DT>Four for the quarters, and twelve for the hour;
<DT>Ever and aye, by shine and shower,
<DT>Sixteen short howls, not over loud;
<DT>Some say, she sees my lady's shroud.
<P>
<DT>Is the night chilly and dark?
<DT>The night is chilly, but not dark.
<DT>The thin gray cloud is spread on high,
<DT>It covers but not hides the sky.
<DT>The moon is behind, and at the full;
<DT>And yet she looks both small and dull.
<DT>The night is chill, the cloud is gray:
<DT>'T is a month before the month of May,
<DT>And the Spring comes slowly up this way.
<DT>The lovely lady, Christabel,
<DT>Whom her father loves so well,
<DT>What makes her in the wood so late,
<DT>A furlong from the castle gate?
<DT>She had dreams all yesternight
<DT>Of her own betrothed knight;
<DT>And she in the midnight wood will pray
<DT>For the weal of her lover that's far away.
<P>
<DT>She stole along, she nothing spoke,
<DD>  The sighs she heaved were soft and low,
<DT>And naught was green upon the oak,
<DD>  But moss and rarest mistletoe:
<DT>She kneels beneath the huge oak tree,
<DT>And in silence prayeth she.
<P>
<DT>The lady sprang up suddenly,
<DD>  The lovely lady, Christabel!
<DT>It moaned as near, as near can be,
<DD>  But what it is she cannot tell.-
<DT>On the other side it seems to be,
<DT>Of the huge, broad-breasted, old oak tree.
<DT>The night is chill; the forest bare;
<DD>  Is it the wind that moaneth bleak?
<DT>There is not wind enough in the air
<DT>To move away the ringlet curl
<DD>  From the lovely lady's cheek-
<DT>There is not wind enough to twirl
<DT>The one red leaf, the last of its clan,
<DT>That dances as often as dance it can,
<DT>Hanging so light, and hanging so high,
<DT>On the topmost twig that looks up at the sky.
<P>
<DT>Hush, beating heart of Christabel!
<DT>Jesu, Maria, shield her well!
<DT>She folded her arms beneath her cloak,
<DT>And stole to the other side of the oak.
<DD>  What sees she there?
<P>
<DT>There she sees a damsel bright,
<DT>Dressed in a silken robe of white,
<DT>That shadowy in the moonlight shone:
<DT>The neck that made that white robe wan,
<DT>Her stately neck, and arms were bare;
<DT>Her blue-veined feet unsandaled were;
<DT>And wildly glittered here and there
<DT>The gems entangled in her hair.
<DT>I guess, 't was frightful there to see
<DT>A lady so richly clad as she-
<DT>Beautiful exceedingly!
<P>
<DT>'Mary mother, save me now!'
<DT>Said Christabel, 'and who art thou?'
<P>
<DT>The lady strange made answer meet,
<DT>And her voice was faint and sweet:-
<DT>'Have pity on my sore distress,
<DT>I scarce can speak for weariness:
<DT>Stretch forth thy hand, and have no fear!'
<DT>Said Christabel, 'How camest thou here?'
<DT>And the lady, whose voice was faint and sweet,
<DT>Did thus pursue her answer meet:-
<DT>'My sire is of a noble line,
<DT>And my name is Geraldine:
<DT>Five warriors seized me yestermorn,
<DT>Me, even me, a maid forlorn:
<DT>They choked my cries with force and fright,
<DT>And tied me on a palfrey white.
<DT>The palfrey was as fleet as wind,
<DT>And they rode furiously behind.
<DT>They spurred amain, their steeds were white:
<DT>And once we crossed the shade of night.
<DT>As sure as Heaven shall rescue me,
<DT>I have no thought what men they be;
<DT>Nor do I know how long it is
<DT>(For I have lain entranced, I wis)
<DT>Since one, the tallest of the five,
<DT>Took me from the palfrey's back,
<DT>A weary woman, scarce alive.
<DT>Some muttered words his comrades spoke:
<DT>He placed me underneath this oak;
<DT>He swore they would return with haste;
<DT>Whither they went I cannot tell-
<DT>I thought I heard, some minutes past,
<DT>Sounds as of a castle bell.
<DT>Stretch forth thy hand,' thus ended she,
<DT>'And help a wretched maid to flee.'
<P>
<DT>Then Christabel stretched forth her hand,
<DD>  And comforted fair Geraldine:
<DT>'O well, bright dame, may you command
<DD>  The service of Sir Leoline;
<DT>And gladly our stout chivalry
<DD>  Will he send forth, and friends withal,
<DT>To guide and guard you safe and free
<DD>  Home to your noble father's hall.'
<P>
<DT>She rose: and forth with steps they passed
<DT>That strove to be, and were not, fast.
<DT>Her gracious stars the lady blest,
<DD>  And thus spake on sweet Christabel:
<DT>'All our household are at rest,
<DD>  The hall is silent as the cell;
<DT>Sir Leoline is weak in health,
<DD>  And may not well awakened be,
<DT>But we will move as if in stealth;
<DD>  And I beseech your courtesy,
<DD>  This night, to share your couch with me.'
<P>
<DT>They crossed the moat, and Christabel
<DT>Took the key that fitted well;
<DT>A little door she opened straight,
<DT>All in the middle of the gate;
<DT>The gate that was ironed within and without,
<DT>Where an army in battle array had marched out.
<DT>The lady sank, belike through pain,
<DT>And Christabel with might and main
<DT>Lifted her up, a weary weight,
<DT>Over the threshold of the gate:
<DT>Then the lady rose again,
<DT>And moved, as she were not in pain.
<P>
<DT>So, free from danger, free from fear,
<DT>They crossed the court: right glad they were.
<DT>And Christabel devoutly cried
<DT>To the Lady by her side;
<DT>'Praise we the Virgin all divine,
<DD>  Who hath rescued thee from thy distress!'
<DT>'Alas, alas!' said Geraldine,
<DD>  'I cannot speak for weariness.'
<DT>So, free from danger, free from fear,
<DT>They crossed the court: right glad they were.
<P>
<DT>Outside her kennel the mastiff old
<DT>Lay fast asleep, in moonshine cold.
<DT>The mastiff old did not awake,
<DT>Yet she an angry moan did make.
<DT>And what can ail the mastiff bitch?
<DT>Never till now she uttered yell
<DT>Beneath the eye of Christabel.
<DT>Perhaps it is the owlet's scritch:
<DT>For what can aid the mastiff bitch?
<P>
<DT>They passed the hall, that echoes still,
<DT>Pass as lightly as you will.
<DT>The brands were flat, the brands were dying,
<DT>Amid their own white ashes lying;
<DT>But when the lady passed, there came
<DT>A tongue of light, a fit of flame;
<DT>And Christabel saw the lady's eye,
<DT>And nothing else saw she thereby,
<DT>Save the boss of the shield of Sir Leoline tall,
<DT>Which hung in a murky old niche in the wall.
<DT>'O softly tread,' said Christabel,
<DT>'My father seldom sleepeth well.'
<DT>Sweet Christabel her feet doth bare,
<DT>And, jealous of the listening air,
<DT>They steal their way from stair to stair,
<DT>Now in glimmer, and now in gloom,
<DT>And now they pass the Baron's room,
<DT>As still as death, with stifled breath!
<DT>And now have reached her chamber door;
<DT>And now doth Geraldine press down
<DT>The rushes of the chamber floor.
<P>
<DT>The moon shines dim in the open air,
<DT>And not a moonbeam enters here.
<DT>But they without its light can see
<DT>The chamber carved so curiously,
<DD>  Carved with figures strange and sweet,
<DT>All made out of the carver's brain,
<DD>  For a lady's chamber meet:
<DT>The lamp with twofold silver chain
<DD>  Is fastened to an angel's feet.
<DT>The silver lamp burns dead and dim;
<DT>But Christabel the lamp will trim.
<DD>  She trimmed the lamp, and made it bright,
<DT>And left it swinging to and fro,
<DD>  While Geraldine, in wretched plight,
<DT>Sank down upon the floor below.
<DT>'O weary lady, Geraldine,
<DT>I pray you, drink this cordial wine!
<DT>It is a wine of virtuous powers;
<DT>My mother made it of wild flowers.'
<P>
<DD>  'And will your mother pity me,
<DT>Who am a maiden most forlorn?'
<DT>Christabel answered- 'Woe is me!
<DD>  She died the hour that I was born.
<DT>I have heard the gray-haired friar tell,
<DD>  How on her death-bed she did say,
<DT>That she should hear the castle-bell
<DD>  Strike twelve upon my wedding-day.
<DT>O mother dear! that thou wert here!'
<DT>'I would,' said Geraldine, 'she were!'
<P>
<DT>But soon, with altered voice, said she-
<DD>  'Off, wandering mother! Peak and pine!
<DT>I have power to bid thee flee.'
<DD>  Alas! what ails poor Geraldine?
<DT>Why stares she with unsettled eye?
<DT>Can she the bodiless dead espy?
<DT>And why with hollow voice cries she,
<DD>  'Off, woman, off! this hour is mine-
<DT>Though thou her guardian spirit be,
<DT>Off, woman. off! 't is given to me.'
<P>
<DT>Then Christabel knelt by the lady's side,
<DD>  And raised to heaven her eyes so blue-
<DT>'Alas!' said she, 'this ghastly ride-
<DD>  Dear lady! it hath wildered you!'
<DT>The lady wiped her moist cold brow,
<DT>And faintly said, ''T is over now!'
<DD>  Again the wild-flower wine she drank:
<DT>Her fair large eyes 'gan glitter bright,
<DD>  And from the floor, whereon she sank,
<DT>The lofty lady stood upright:
<DD>  She was most beautiful to see,
<DD>  Like a lady of a far countree.
<P>
<DD>  And thus the lofty lady spake-
<DT>'All they, who live in the upper sky,
<DD>    Do love you, holy Christabel!
<DD>  And you love them, and for their sake,
<DD>    And for the good which me befell,
<DT>Even I in my degree will try,
<DD>    Fair maiden, to requite you well.
<DT>But now unrobe yourself; for I
<DT>Must pray, ere yet in bed I lie.'
<P>
<DT>Quoth Christabel, 'So let it be!'
<DT>And as the lady bade, did she.
<DT>Her gentle limbs did she undress
<DT>And lay down in her loveliness.
<P>
<DT>But through her brain, of weal and woe,
<DT>So many thoughts moved to and fro,
<DT>That vain it were her lids to close;
<DT>So half-way from the bed she rose,
<DT>And on her elbow did recline.
<DT>To look at the lady Geraldine.
<DT>Beneath the lamp the lady bowed,
<DD>  And slowly rolled her eyes around;
<DT>Then drawing in her breath aloud,
<DD>  Like one that shuddered, she unbound
<DT>The cincture from beneath her breast:
<DT>Her silken robe, and inner vest,
<DT>Dropped to her feet, and full in view,
<DT>Behold! her bosom and half her side-
<DT>A sight to dream of, not to tell!
<DT>O shield her! shield sweet Christabel!
<P>
<DT>Yet Geraldine nor speaks nor stirs:
<DT>Ah! what a stricken look was hers!
<DT>Deep from within she seems half-way
<DT>To lift some weight with sick assay,
<DT>And eyes the maid and seeks delay;
<DT>Then suddenly, as one defied,
<DT>Collects herself in scorn and pride,
<DT>And lay down by the maiden's side!-
<DT>And in her arms the maid she took,
<DD>        Ah, well-a-day!
<DT>And with low voice and doleful look
<DD>        These words did say:
<P>
<DT>'In the touch of this bosom there worketh a spell,
<DT>Which is lord of thy utterance, Christabel!
<DT>Thou knowest to-night, and wilt know to-morrow,
<DT>This mark of my shame, this seal of my sorrow;
<DD>      But vainly thou warrest,
<DD>        For this is alone in
<DD>      Thy power to declare,
<DD>        That in the dim forest
<DD>      Thou heard'st a low moaning,
<DT>And found'st a bright lady, surpassingly fair:
<DT>And didst bring her home with thee, in love and in charity,
<DT>To shield her and shelter her from the damp air.'
<P>
<DT>It was a lovely sight to see
<DT>The lady Christabel, when she
<DT>Was praying at the old oak tree.
<DD>    Amid the jagged shadows
<DD>    Of mossy leafless boughs,
<DD>    Kneeling in the moonlight,
<DD>    To make her gentle vows;
<DT>Her slender palms together prest,
<DT>Heaving sometimes on her breast;
<DT>Her face resigned to bliss or bale-
<DT>Her face, oh, call it fair not pale,
<DT>And both blue eyes more bright than clear.
<DT>Each about to have a tear.
<DT>With open eyes (ah, woe is me!)
<DT>Asleep, and dreaming fearfully,
<DT>Fearfully dreaming, yet, I wis,
<DT>Dreaming that alone, which is-
<DT>O sorrow and shame! Can this be she,
<DT>The lady, who knelt at the old oak tree?
<DT>And lo! the worker of these harms,
<DT>That holds the maiden in her arms,
<DT>Seems to slumber still and mild,
<DT>As a mother with her child.
<P>
<DT>A star hath set, a star hath risen,
<DD>  O Geraldine! since arms of thine
<DT>Have been the lovely lady's prison.
<DD>  O Geraldine! one hour was thine-
<DT>Thou'st had thy will! By tarn and rill,
<DT>The night-birds all that hour were still.
<DT>But now they are jubilant anew,
<DT>From cliff and tower, tu-whoo! tu-whoo!
<DT>Tu-whoo! tu-whoo! from wood and fell!
<P>
<DT>And see! the lady Christabel
<DT>Gathers herself from out her trance;
<DT>Her limbs relax, her countenance
<DT>Grows sad and soft; the smooth thin lids
<DT>Close o'er her eyes; and tears she sheds-
<DT>Large tears that leave the lashes bright!
<DT>And oft the while she seems to smile
<DT>As infants at a sudden light!
<DT>Yea, she doth smile, and she doth weep,
<DD>  Like a youthful hermitess,
<DD>  Beauteous in a wilderness,
<DT>Who, praying always, prays in sleep.
<DT>And, if she move unquietly,
<DT>Perchance, 't is but the blood so free
<DT>Comes back and tingles in her feet.
<DT>No doubt, she hath a vision sweet.
<DT>What if her guardian spirit 't were,
<DT>What if she knew her mother near?
<DT>But this she knows, in joys and woes,
<DT>That saints will aid if men will call:
<DT>For the blue sky bends over all.

<h3>            PART II</h3>
<UL><DL>
<P>
<DT>Each matin bell, the Baron saith,
<DT>Knells us back to a world of death.
<DT>These words Sir Leoline first said,
<DT>When he rose and found his lady dead:
<DT>These words Sir Leoline will say
<DT>Many a morn to his dying day!
<P>
<DT>And hence the custom and law began
<DT>That still at dawn the sacristan,
<DT>Who duly pulls the heavy bell,
<DT>Five and forty beads must tell
<DT>Between each stroke- a warning knell,
<DT>Which not a soul can choose but hear
<DT>From Bratha Head to Wyndermere.
<DT>Saith Bracy the bard, 'So let it knell!
<DT>And let the drowsy sacristan
<DT>Still count as slowly as he can!'
<DT>There is no lack of such, I ween,
<DT>As well fill up the space between.
<DT>In Langdale Pike and Witch's Lair,
<DT>And Dungeon-ghyll so foully rent,
<DT>With ropes of rock and bells of air
<DT>Three sinful sextons' ghosts are pent,
<DT>Who all give back, one after t' other,
<DT>The death-note to their living brother;
<DT>And oft too, by the knell offended,
<DT>Just as their one! two! three! is ended,
<DT>The devil mocks the doleful tale
<DT>With a merry peal from Borrowdale.
<P>
<DT>The air is still! through mist and cloud
<DT>That merry peal comes ringing loud;
<DT>And Geraldine shakes off her dread,
<DT>And rises lightly from the bed;
<DT>Puts on her silken vestments white,
<DT>And tricks her hair in lovely plight,
<DT>And nothing doubting of her spell
<DT>Awakens the lady Christabel.
<DT>'Sleep you, sweet lady Christabel?
<DT>I trust that you have rested well.'
<P>
<DT>And Christabel awoke and spied
<DT>The same who lay down by her side-
<DT>O rather say, the same whom she
<DT>Raised up beneath the old oak tree!
<DT>Nay, fairer yet! and yet more fair!
<DT>For she belike hath drunken deep
<DT>Of all the blessedness of sleep!
<DT>And while she spake, her looks, her air,
<DT>Such gentle thankfulness declare,
<DT>That (so it seemed) her girded vests
<DT>Grew tight beneath her heaving breasts.
<DT>'Sure I have sinned!' said Christabel,
<DT>'Now heaven be praised if all be well!'
<DT>And in low faltering tones, yet sweet,
<DT>Did she the lofty lady greet
<DT>With such perplexity of mind
<DT>As dreams too lively leave behind.
<P>
<DT>So quickly she rose, and quickly arrayed
<DT>Her maiden limbs, and having prayed
<DT>That He, who on the cross did groan,
<DT>Might wash away her sins unknown,
<DT>She forthwith led fair Geraldine
<DT>To meet her sire, Sir Leoline.
<DT>The lovely maid and the lady tall
<DT>Are pacing both into the hall,
<DT>And pacing on through page and groom,
<DT>Enter the Baron's presence-room.
<P>
<DT>The Baron rose, and while he prest
<DT>His gentle daughter to his breast,
<DT>With cheerful wonder in his eyes
<DT>The lady Geraldine espies,
<DT>And gave such welcome to the same,
<DT>As might beseem so bright a dame!
<P>
<DT>But when he heard the lady's tale,
<DT>And when she told her father's name,
<DT>Why waxed Sir Leoline so pale,
<DT>Murmuring o'er the name again,
<DT>Lord Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine?
<DT>Alas! they had been friends in youth;
<DT>But whispering tongues can poison truth;
<DT>And constancy lives in realms above;
<DT>And life is thorny; and youth is vain;
<DT>And to be wroth with one we love
<DT>Doth work like madness in the brain.
<DT>And thus it chanced, as I divine,
<DT>With Roland and Sir Leoline.
<DT>Each spake words of high disdain
<DT>And insult to his heart's best brother:
<DT>They parted- ne'er to meet again!
<DT>But never either found another
<DT>To free the hollow heart from paining-
<DT>They stood aloof, the scars remaining,
<DT>Like cliffs which had been rent asunder;
<DT>A dreary sea now flows between.
<DT>But neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder,
<DT>Shall wholly do away, I ween,
<DT>The marks of that which once hath been.
<DT>Sir Leoline, a moment's space,
<DT>Stood gazing on the damsel's face:
<DT>And the youthful Lord of Tryermaine
<DT>Came back upon his heart again.
<P>
<DT>O then the Baron forgot his age,
<DT>His noble heart swelled high with rage;
<DT>He swore by the wounds in Jesu's side
<DT>He would proclaim it far and wide,
<DT>With trump and solemn heraldry,
<DD>  That they, who thus had wronged the dame
<DT>Were base as spotted infamy!
<DD>  'And if they dare deny the same,
<DT>My herald shall appoint a week,
<DT>And let the recreant traitors seek
<DD>  My tourney court- that there and then
<DT>I may dislodge their reptile souls
<DD>  From the bodies and forms of men!'
<DT>He spake: his eye in lightning rolls!
<DT>For the lady was ruthlessly seized; and he kenned
<DT>In the beautiful lady the child of his friend!
<P>
<DT>And now the tears were on his face,
<DD>  And fondly in his arms he took
<DT>Fair Geraldine who met the embrace,
<DD>  Prolonging it with joyous look.
<DT>Which when she viewed, a vision fell
<DT>Upon the soul of Christabel,
<DT>The vision of fear, the touch and pain!
<DT>She shrunk and shuddered, and saw again-
<DT>(Ah, woe is me! Was it for thee,
<DT>Thou gentle maid! such sights to see?)
<DD>  Again she saw that bosom old,
<DD>  Again she felt that bosom cold,
<DT>And drew in her breath with a hissing sound:
<DT>Whereat the Knight turned wildly round,
<DT>And nothing saw, but his own sweet maid
<DT>With eyes upraised, as one that prayed.
<P>
<DT>The touch, the sight, had passed away,
<DD>  And in its stead that vision blest,
<DD>  Which comforted her after-rest,
<DT>While in the lady's arms she lay,
<DD>  Had put a rapture in her breast,
<DT>And on her lips and o'er her eyes
<DT>Spread smiles like light!
<DD>                       With new surprise,
<DT>'What ails then my beloved child?'
<DT>The Baron said- His daughter mild
<DT>Made answer, 'All will yet be well!'
<DT>I ween, she had no power to tell
<DT>Aught else: so mighty was the spell.
<P>
<DT>Yet he who saw this Geraldine,
<DT>Had deemed her sure a thing divine.
<DT>Such sorrow with such grace she blended,
<DT>As if she feared she had offended
<DT>Sweet Christabel, that gentle maid!
<DT>And with such lowly tones she prayed
<DT>She might be sent without delay
<DT>Home to her father's mansion.
<DD>                                    'Nay!
<DT>Nay, by my soul!' said Leoline.
<DT>'Ho! Bracy the bard, the charge be thine!
<DT>Go thou, with music sweet and loud,
<DT>And take two steeds with trappings proud,
<DT>And take the youth whom thou lov'st best
<DT>To bear thy harp, and learn thy song,
<DT>And clothe you both in solemn vest,
<DT>And over the mountains haste along,
<DT>Lest wandering folk, that are abroad,
<DT>Detain you on the valley road.
<P>
<DT>'And when he has crossed the Irthing flood,
<DT>My merry bard! he hastes, he hastes
<DT>Up Knorren Moor, through Halegarth Wood,
<DT>And reaches soon that castle good
<DT>Which stands and threatens Scotland's wastes.
<P>
<DT>'Bard Bracy! bard Bracy! your horses are fleet,
<DT>Ye must ride up the hall, your music so sweet,
<DT>More loud than your horses' echoing feet!
<DT>And loud and loud to Lord Roland call,
<DT>Thy daughter is safe in Langdale hall!
<DT>Thy beautiful daughter is safe and free-
<DT>Sir Leoline greets thee thus through me.
<DT>He bids thee come without delay
<DT>With all thy numerous array;
<DT>And take thy lovely daughter home:
<DT>And he will meet thee on the way
<DT>With all his numerous array
<DT>White with their panting palfreys' foam:
<DT>And, by mine honor! I will say,
<DT>That I repent me of the day
<DT>When I spake words of fierce disdain
<DT>To Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine!-
<DT>- For since that evil hour hath flown,
<DT>Many a summer's sun hath shone;
<DT>Yet ne'er found I a friend again
<DT>Like Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine.'
<P>
<DT>The lady fell, and clasped his knees,
<DT>Her face upraised, her eyes o'erflowing;
<DT>And Bracy replied, with faltering voice,
<DT>His gracious hail on all bestowing;
<DT>'Thy words, thou sire of Christabel,
<DT>Are sweeter than my harp can tell;
<DT>Yet might I gain a boon of thee,
<DT>This day my journey should not be,
<DT>So strange a dream hath come to me;
<DT>That I had vowed with music loud
<DT>To clear yon wood from thing unblest,
<DT>Warned by a vision in my rest!
<DT>For in my sleep I saw that dove,
<DT>That gentle bird, whom thou dost love,
<DT>And call'st by thy own daughter's name-
<DT>Sir Leoline! I saw the same,
<DT>Fluttering, and uttering fearful moan,
<DT>Among the green herbs in the forest alone.
<DT>Which when I saw and when I heard,
<DT>I wondered what might ail the bird;
<DT>For nothing near it could I see,
<DT>Save the grass and herbs underneath the old tree.
<DT>And in my dream methought I went
<DT>To search out what might there be found;
<DT>And what the sweet bird's trouble meant,
<DT>That thus lay fluttering on the ground.
<DT>I went and peered, and could descry
<DT>No cause for her distressful cry;
<DT>But yet for her dear lady's sake
<DT>I stooped, methought, the dove to take,
<DT>When lo! I saw a bright green snake
<DT>Coiled around its wings and neck.
<DT>Green as the herbs on which it couched,
<DT>Close by the dove's its head it crouched;
<DT>And with the dove it heaves and stirs,
<DT>Swelling its neck as she swelled hers!
<DT>I woke; it was the midnight hour,
<DT>The clock was echoing in the tower;
<DT>But though my slumber was gone by,
<DT>This dream it would not pass away-
<DT>It seems to live upon my eye!
<DT>And thence I vowed this self-same day
<DT>With music strong and saintly song
<DT>To wander through the forest bare,
<DT>Lest aught unholy loiter there.'
<P>
<DT>Thus Bracy said: the Baron, the while,
<DT>Half-listening heard him with a smile;
<DT>Then turned to Lady Geraldine,
<DT>His eyes made up of wonder and love;
<DT>And said in courtly accents fine,
<DT>'Sweet maid, Lord Roland's beauteous dove,
<DT>With arms more strong than harp or song,
<DT>Thy sire and I will crush the snake!'
<DT>He kissed her forehead as he spake,
<DT>And Geraldine in maiden wise
<DT>Casting down her large bright eyes,
<DT>With blushing cheek and courtesy fine
<DT>She turned her from Sir Leoline;
<DT>Softly gathering up her train,
<DT>That o'er her right arm fell again;
<DT>And folded her arms across her chest,
<DT>And couched her head upon her breast,
<DT>And looked askance at Christabel-
<DT>Jesu, Maria, shield her well!
<P>
<DT>A snake's small eye blinks dull and shy,
<DT>And the lady's eyes they shrunk in her head,
<DT>Each shrunk up to a serpent's eye,
<DT>And with somewhat of malice, and more of dread,
<DT>At Christabel she looked askance!-
<DT>One moment- and the sight was fled!
<DT>But Christabel in dizzy trance
<DT>Stumbling on the unsteady ground
<DT>Shuddered aloud, with a hissing sound;
<DT>And Geraldine again turned round,
<DT>And like a thing that sought relief,
<DT>Full of wonder and full of grief,
<DT>She rolled her large bright eyes divine
<DT>Wildly on Sir Leoline.
<P>
<DT>The maid, alas! her thoughts are gone,
<DT>She nothing sees- no sight but one!
<DT>The maid, devoid of guile and sin,
<DT>I know not how, in fearful wise,
<DT>So deeply had she drunken in
<DT>That look, those shrunken serpent eyes,
<DT>That all her features were resigned
<DT>To this sole image in her mind:
<DT>And passively did imitate
<DT>That look of dull and treacherous hate!
<DT>And thus she stood, in dizzy trance,
<DT>Still picturing that look askance
<DT>With forced unconscious sympathy
<DT>Full before her father's view-
<DT>As far as such a look could be
<DT>In eyes so innocent and blue!
<P>
<DT>And when the trance was o'er, the maid
<DT>Paused awhile, and inly prayed:
<DT>Then falling at the Baron's feet,
<DT>'By my mother's soul do I entreat
<DT>That thou this woman send away!'
<DT>She said: and more she could not say;
<DT>For what she knew she could not tell,
<DT>O'er-mastered by the mighty spell.
<DT>Why is thy cheek so wan and wild,
<DT>Sir Leoline? Thy only child
<DT>Lies at thy feet, thy joy, thy pride.
<DT>So fair, so innocent, so mild;
<DT>The same, for whom thy lady died!
<DT>O by the pangs of her dear mother
<DT>Think thou no evil of thy child!
<DT>For her, and thee, and for no other,
<DT>She prayed the moment ere she died:
<DT>Prayed that the babe for whom she died,
<DT>Might prove her dear lord's joy and pride!
<DD>  That prayer her deadly pangs beguiled,
<DD>        Sir Leoline!
<DD>  And wouldst thou wrong thy only child,
<DD>        Her child and thine?
<P>
<DT>Within the Baron's heart and brain
<DT>If thoughts, like these, had any share,
<DT>They only swelled his rage and pain,
<DT>And did but work confusion there.
<DT>His heart was cleft with pain and rage,
<DT>His cheeks they quivered, his eyes were wild,
<DT>Dishonored thus in his old age;
<DT>Dishonored by his only child,
<DT>And all his hospitality
<DT>To the insulted daughter of his friend
<DT>By more than woman's jealousy
<DT>Brought thus to a disgraceful end-
<DT>He rolled his eye with stern regard
<DT>Upon the gentle ministrel bard,
<DT>And said in tones abrupt, austere-
<DT>'Why, Bracy! dost thou loiter here?
<DT>I bade thee hence!' The bard obeyed;
<DT>And turning from his own sweet maid,
<DT>The aged knight, Sir Leoline,
<DT>Led forth the lady Geraldine!

<h3>THE CONCLUSION TO PART II</h3>
<UL><DL>
<P>

<DT>A little child, a limber elf,
<DT>Singing, dancing to itself,
<DT>A fairy thing with red round cheeks,
<DT>That always finds, and never seeks,
<DT>Makes such a vision to the sight
<DT>As fills a father's eyes with light;
<DT>And pleasures flow in so thick and fast
<DT>Upon his heart, that he at last
<DT>Must needs express his love's excess
<DT>With words of unmeant bitterness.
<DT>Perhaps 'tis pretty to force together
<DT>Thoughts so all unlike each other;
<DT>To mutter and mock a broken charm,
<DT>To dally with wrong that does no harm.
<DT>Perhaps 'tis tender too and pretty
<DT>At each wild word to feel within
<DT>A sweet recoil of love and pity.
<DT>And what, if in a world of sin
<DT>(O sorrow and shame should this be true!)
<DT>Such giddiness of heart and brain
<DT>Comes seldom save from rage and pain,
<DT>So talks as it's most used to do.
