<h2>Philip K. Dick and Human Kindness</h2><p>

I have never been able to stand the self-conscious novelist, 
who teaches university for a living and delivers one 
Great American novel a year. Self-reverential and -referential,
this individual bleeds "literature" to the exclusion of anything
unconscious and true. <p>

Opposed to this is the natural, the idiot savant, the desperate
man who has no idea that he is writing anything memorable, the
madman whose pulp fiction is half garbage and half genius. This
was Philip K. Dick, who started and ended his career writing
cheap Ace paperbacks, who did too many drugs and left too many
marriages and died at age 53, but whose writing has a quality of 
unexpected wild insight that guarantees he will be remembered.<p>

He is best known as the author of <b>Do Androids Dream of 
Electric Sheep?</b>, which was filmed, not very faithfully, 
as <i>Blade Runner</i>. The original--which would have made
a better, but less popular, movie if filmed exactly as written--
is among the best of Dick's explorations of the question: What is
human?<p>

Dick took too many hallucinogenic drugs in his lifetime, and they
undid him. There is a very funny, yet very grave scene in
<b>A Scanner Darkly</b>, a very realistic novel of drug use
with a minimal science fiction overlay, in which a group of
friends are unable to analyze how the gear shift on a bicycle
works, due to the damage they have done to their brains. Like
the acid-inspired art in Timothy Leary's books, in which human 
scenes decompose into unrecognizable abstract shapes,  Dick's
hallucination-filled consciousness wound up being an obstacle
to truth. Dick fell for the major fallacy of the '60's, that
hallucinogens would be a gateway to truth, not a path into darkness.
Sometimes he recognized this as the tragedy of his life,
but would soon after revert to a search for mystical revelation. He
spent his entire life looking for God.<p>

Dick's fiction deals with three levels of reality.  To
the <i>is</i> and the <i>ought</i>, favorite playing field of
philosophers since the beginning of human abstraction, Dick adds
<i>the seen</i>, which is stripped away by means of drugs to
reveal the hidden <i>is</i>:<p>

<blockquote>The soft-drink stand fell into bits. Molecules. He saw
the molecules, colorless, without qualities, that made it up. 
Then he saw through, into the space beyond it, he saw the hill
behind, the trees and sky....In its place was a slip of paper.
He reached out his hand and took hold of the slip of paper.
On it was printing, block letters.<p>

SOFT DRINK STAND</blockquote><p>

In this novel, <b>Time Out of Joint</b>, Ragle Gumm thinks he is
living a quiet life in a 1950's American town, and solving a newspaper
puzzle each day called <i>Where Will the Little Green Men be Next?</i>
In reality, he is insane, living in a time of unbearable interstellar
war, and predicting the time and place of the next attack by solving 
the puzzle. His <i>seen</i> reality, entirely false, is stripped away,
layer by layer, until he reaches the <i>is</i>. It is only when we know
the <i>is</i> that we can begin thinking about the <i>ought</i>.<p>

<b>Time Out of Joint</b> is an early and inferior novel, ringing some
interesting changes on a traditional science fiction theme: Everything
You Think You Know is False. Dick would tell this story again, with
increased certainty and poignancy. Good novels and bad each contain
one or more set pieces where reality spins out of control; people
fall through holes, everything changes, dead things come back to life or
the protagonist falls into the underworld. Many of these episodes are
based on real drug experiences of Dick's; he plants them in the
midst of a narrative, like an embedded and strange jewel, and then 
brings you most of the way back to the narrative afterwards. He always
leaves some details unexplained so that the episode continues to stand
out; it is never entirely integrated.  One of Dick's most
expert mindgames occurs in <b>Androids</b>. The mentally slow J.R.
Isidore, being held hostage by fugitive androids, finds a spider in his
house. All living things are precious in the future portrayed in
the novel because there are so few animals left. The androids,
who feel no compassion, amuse themselves by cutting off the spider's
legs, to see how few it requires to walk. <p>

<blockquote>With the scissors Pris snipped off another of the 
spider's legs. "Four now," she said. She nudged the spider. "He won't
go. But he can."</blockquote><p>

The scene is a tour de force; at the same time as Pris is torturing the
spider, an endless talk show which broadcasts 24 hours a day--Dick's
morbidly funny take on the media--is debunking the "Mercerism" religion
of compassion in the background. Dick, with a very sure touch, shifts
back and forth between Pris, the talk show host's revelations, and
Isidore's reactions to both. Finally, Isidore can take no more and
falls through the floor into the "tomb world", where he sees dead 
things coming back to life, and meets Mercer, who freely admits 
that he is a fraud but is  undeniably human, therefore real,
  at the same time. He lifts Isidore from the tomb world and
says (in Dick's truest voice):<p>

<blockquote>"I lifted you from the tomb world just now and I will continue to 
lift you until you lose interest and want to quit. But you will
have to stop searching for me because I will never stop searching
for you."</blockquote><p>

Isidore returns to the <i>seen</i>--but the dead spider, which Mercer
has restored to life, is still alive. Dick usually leaves a loose end
like this one to avoid complete incorporation of the hallucinatory 
set-piece into the narrative--to let you know that the vision is more
real than the life which it temporarily interrupted. <p>

<b>Android</b> is Dick's clearest statement about the nature of the human.
In stripping away the nonessential, he makes it clear that being human 
doesn't mean walking on two legs, having eyes, speaking language or
even making love--the androids can do all this. It is the crazy,
off-kilter, unconscious compassionate quality that Isidore has, and
which is echoed in Mercer, the loving and magical fraud whose 
dishonesty <i>doesn't matter</i>, because it is completely dwarfed
and made insignificant by his humanity. In Dick's universe, a
creature that resembles an insect or a pudding may qualify as
human even when something that looks, walks and talks like a man does not.<p>

Dick's fiction, like all fiction, held a mirror up to his life.
Proust said that great art results not from the quality of the
life but of the mirror. Dick's was a spotted, distorted mirror that
reflected flashes of the J.R. Isidore quality; so, if Dick's novels
dealt with life on three levels, each was a reflection of three 
levels of his own life, creating six levels in all:<p>

<ul>

<li>The "seen" as Dick perceived it, which he believed to be false,
but which in many instances was real, so that like many others in
the '60's, he was evading the real when he thought he was finding it.<p>

<li>The "seen" of the novels, which is always false.<p>

<li>The "is" of his life, which was mainly a hallucination.<p>

<li>The "is" of the novels, which is always real.<p>

<li>The "ought" of his life, which (even if he defined it in
relation to a false "is") was founded on an ethic of compassion
and love.<p>

<li>The "ought" of the novels, founded on the same ethic.<p>
</ul>

So, between the life and the work, the "seen" and the "is" deny each
other, but "ought" matches "ought". This is a tribute to Dick; he
was terribly lost but unlike most lost folk, he knew where the destination
was. The old story ends, "you can't get there from here." Dick's dilemma
was the opposite; he didn't know how to get <i>here</i> from there.<p>

 In a letter written a few months before he died, he called his life
"decades of disorder and intoxication and smashing and leaving and just
plain wandering the face of the Earth." He wrote to his daughter two
months later that God intervenes when our burden becomes too great,
but only if we call out (this is of a piece with Mercer's "only if
you stop looking for me"):<p>

<blockquote>this is why not all humans are saved, because not all
humans see, ever, in their entire lives, that they live by and
through God, and God alone.</blockquote><p>

Most of his life, he had been chaotic, physically and verbally 
abusing the women who loved him, even moving to harm when he 
hypocritically told himself he was helping (as when he tried to 
have one woman committed to a mental institution.) He was a 
cruel and self-involved man who genuinely wanted to be good--
not simply to be seen as good, like most people, but to <i>be</i>,
in a mute, intuitive way, like J.R. Isidore. All his novels portray
 his continual struggle for the <i>ought</i>. He lost, but it was a 
noble failure.  The  humanity he craved, and portrayed in the <i>ought</i>
of his fiction, is an unobtrusive 
perfect work, like the unobtrusive perfect works
that had a habit of turning up unexpectedly in his novels:<p>

<blockquote>The blue vase made by Mary Ann Dominic and purchased by
Jason Taverner as a gift for Heather Hart wound up in a private collection
of modern pottery. It remains there to this day, and is much treasured.
And, in fact, by a number of people who know ceramics, openly
and genuinely cherished. And loved.</blockquote><p>
