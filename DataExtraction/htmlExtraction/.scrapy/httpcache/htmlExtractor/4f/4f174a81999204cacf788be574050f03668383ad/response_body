<P>
<br>I have been one acquainted with the night.
<br>I have walked out in rain—and back in rain.
<br>I have outwalked the furthest city light.
<P>
<br>I have looked down the saddest city lane.
<br>I have passed by the watchman on his beat
<br>And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.
<P>
<br>I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
<br>When far away an interrupted cry
<br>Came over houses from another street,
<P>
<br>But not to call me back or say good-by;
<br>And further still at an unearthly height
<br>One luminary clock against the sky
<P>
<br>Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.
<br>I have been one acquainted with the night.

<br>My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree
<br>Toward heaven still.
<br>And there's a barrel that I didn't fill
<br>Beside it, and there may be two or three
<br>Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.
<br>But I am done with apple-picking now.
<br>Essence of winter sleep is on the night,
<br>The scent of apples; I am drowsing off.
<br>I cannot shake the shimmer from my sight
<br>I got from looking through a pane of glass
<br>I skimmed this morning from the water-trough,
<br>And held against the world of hoary grass.
<br>It melted, and I let it fall and break.
<br>But I was well
<br>Upon my way to sleep before it fell,
<br>And I could tell
<br>What form my dreaming was about to take.
<br>Magnified apples appear and reappear,
<br>Stem end and blossom end,
<br>And every fleck of russet showing clear.
<br>My instep arch not only keeps the ache,
<br>It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.
<br>And I keep hearing from the cellar-bin
<br>That rumbling sound
<br>Of load on load of apples coming in.
<br>For I have had too much
<br>Of apple-picking; I am overtired
<br>Of the great harvest I myself desired.
<br>There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,
<br>Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall,
<br>For all
<br>That struck the earth,
<br>No matter if not bruised, or spiked with stubble,
<br>Went surely to the cider-apple heap
<br>As of no worth.
<br>One can see what will trouble
<br>This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is.
<br>Were he not gone,
<br>The woodchuck could say whether it's like his
<br>Long sleep, as I describe its coming on,
<br>Or just some human sleep.

<I><h2>Birches</h2></I>
<blockquote><p>

When I see birches bend to left and right   <br>
Across the lines of straighter darker trees,   <br>
I like to think some boy’s been swinging them.   <br>
But swinging doesn’t bend them down to stay.   <br>
Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them   <br> 
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning   <br>
After a rain. They click upon themselves   <br>
As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored   <br>
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.   <br>
Soon the sun’s warmth makes them shed crystal shells <br> 
Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust-   <br>
Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away   <br>
You’d think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.   <br>
They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load, <br>
And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed   <br>
So low for long, they never right themselves:   <br>
You may see their trunks arching in the woods   <br>
Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground   <br>
Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair   <br>
Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.  <br>
But I was going to say when Truth broke in   <br>
With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm   <br>
(Now am I free to be poetical?)   <br>
I should prefer to have some boy bend them   <br>
As he went out and in to fetch the cows-   <br>
Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,   <br>
Whose only play was what he found himself,   <br>
Summer or winter, and could play alone.   <br>
One by one he subdued his father’s trees   <br>
By riding them down over and over again   <br>
Until he took the stiffness out of them,   <br>
And not one but hung limp, not one was left  <br> 
For him to conquer. He learned all there was   <br>
To learn about not launching out too soon   <br>
And so not carrying the tree away  <br>
Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise   <br>
To the top branches, climbing carefully   <br>
With the same pains you use to fill a cup   <br>
Up to the brim, and even above the brim.   <br>
Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,  <br> 
Kicking his way down through the air to the ground. <br>   
<a name=swinger></a><a href=../cereal.html><font color=black>So was I once myself a swinger of birches</font></a>.   <br>
And so I dream of going back to be.   <br>
It’s when I’m weary of considerations,   <br>
And life is too much like a pathless wood   <br> 
Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs   <br>
Broken across it, and one eye is weeping   <br>
From a twig’s having lashed across it open.   <br>
I’d like to get away from earth awhile   <br>
And then come back to it and begin over.   <br> 
May no fate willfully misunderstand me   <br>
And half grant what I wish and snatch me away   <br>
Not to return. Earth’s the right place for love:   <br>
I don’t know where it’s likely to go better.   <br>
I’d like to go by climbing a birch tree,  <br>
And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk   <br>
Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,   <br>
But dipped its top and set me down again.   <br>
That would be good both going and coming back.   <br>
One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.

<br>As I came to the edge of the woods,
<br>Thrush music — hark!
<br>Now if it was dusk outside,
<br>Inside it was dark.
<P>
<br>To dark in the woods for a bird
<br>By sleight of wing
<br>To better its perch for the night,
<br>Though it still could sing.
<P>
<br>The last of the light of the sun
<br>That had died in the west
<br>Still lived for one song more
<br>In a thrush's breast.
<P>
<br>Far in the pillared dark
<br>Thrush music went —
<br>Almost like a call to come in

<P>
<br>Snow falling and night falling fast, oh, fast
<br>In a field I looked into going past,

<P>
<br>The woods around it have it—it is theirs.
<br>All animals are smothered in their lairs.
<br>I am too absent-spirited to count;
<br>The loneliness includes me unawares.
<P>
<br>And lonely as it is that loneliness
<br>Will be more lonely ere it be less—
<br>A blanker whiteness of benighted snow
<br>With no expression, nothing to express.
<P>
<br>They cannot scare me with their empty spaces
<br>Between stars—on stars where no human race is.
<br>I have it in me so much nearer home

<p>
Love at the lips was touch <br>
As sweet as I could bear; <br>
And once that seemed too much; <br> 
I lived on air <br>
That crossed me from sweet things, <br>
The flow of - was it musk <br>
From hidden grapevine springs<br> 
Down hill at dusk? <br>
I had the swirl and ache <br>
From sprays of honeysuckle <br>
That when they're gathered shake<br> 
Dew on the knuckle. <br><a name=craved></a>
I craved strong sweets, but those <br>
Seemed strong when I was young; <br>
The petal of the rose <br>
It was that stung. <br>
Now no joy but lacks salt <br>
That is not dashed with pain <br>
And weariness and fault; <br>
I crave the stain <br>
Of tears, the aftermark <br>
Of almost too much love, <br>
The sweet of bitter bark <br>
And burning clove. <br>
When stiff and sore and scarred <br>
I take away my hand <br>
From leaning on it hard <br>
In grass and sand, <br>
The hurt is not enough: <br> 
I long for weight and strength <br>
To feel the earth as rough <br>
To all my length.

<H2><I><A NAME="frost12"> Mending Wall </A></I></H2>
<ul><DL>
<p>
<br>Something there is that doesn't love a wall,
<br>That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,
<br>And spills the upper boulders in the sun,
<br>And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.
<br>The work of hunters is another thing:
<br>I have come after them and made repair
<br>Where they have left not one stone on a stone,
<br>But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,
<br>To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,
<br>No one has seen them made or heard them made,
<br>But at spring mending-time we find them there.
<br>I let my neighbort know beyond the hill;
<br>And on a day we meet to walk the line
<br>And set the wall between us once again.
<br>We keep the wall between us as we go.
<br>To each the boulders that have fallen to each.
<br>And some are loaves and some so nearly balls
<br>We have to use a spell to make them balance:
<br>'Stay where you are until our backs are turned!'
<br>We wear our fingers rough with handling them.
<br>Oh, just another kind of out-door game,
<br>One on a side. It comes to little more:
<br>There where it is we do not need the wall:
<br>He is all pine and I am apple orchard.
<br>My apple trees will never get across
<br>And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.
<br>He only says, 'Good fences make good neighhours'.
<br>Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder
<br>If I could put a notion in his head:
<br>'Why do they make good neighbours? Isn't it
<br>Where there are cows?
<br>But here there are no cows.
<br>Before I built a wall I'd ask to know
<br>What I was walling in or walling out,
<br>And to whom I was like to give offence.
<br>Something there is that doesn't love a wall,
<br>That wants it down.' I could say '.Elves' to him,
<br>But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather
<br>He said it for himself. I see him there
<br>Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
<br>In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.
<br>He moves in darkness as it seems to me —
<br>Not of woods only and the shade of trees.
<br>He will not go behind his father's saying,
<br>And he likes having thought of it so well
<br>He says again, Good fences make good neighbours.

<h2><I>Mowing</h2></I>
<blockquote>
<p>
There was never a sound beside the wood but one, <br>
And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground. <br>
What was it it whispered? I knew not well myself; <br>
Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun, <br>
Something, perhaps, about the lack of sound— <br>
And that was why it whispered and did not speak. <br>
It was no dream of the gift of idle hours, <br>
Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf: <br>
Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak <br>
To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows, <br>
Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers <br>
(Pale orchises), and scared a bright green snake. <br>
The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows. <br>
My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make.

<p>
The house had gone to bring again <br>
To the midnight sky a sunset glow. <br>
Now the chimney was all of the house that stood, <br>
Like a pistil after the petals go. <br>
The barn opposed across the way, <br>
That would have joined the house in flame <br>
Had it been the will of the wind, was left <br>
To bear forsaken the place's name. <br>
No more it opened with all one end <br>
For teams that came by the stony road <br>
To drum on the floor with scurrying hoofs <br>
And brush the mow with the summer load. <br>
The birds that came to it through the air <br>
At broken windows flew out and in, <br>
Their murmur more like the sigh we sigh <br>
From too much dwelling on what has been. <br>
Yet for them the lilac renewed its leaf, <br>
And the aged elm, though touched with fire; <br>
And the dry pump flung up an awkward arm; <br>
And the fence post carried a strand of wire. <br>
For them there was really nothing sad. <br>
But though they rejoiced in the nest they kept, <br>
One had to be versed in country things <br>
Not to believe the phoebes wept. .

They sent him back to her. The letter came <br>
Saying . . . and she could have him. And before <br>
She could be sure there was no hidden ill <br>
Under the formal writing, he was in her sight — <br>
Living. — They gave him back to her alive — <br>
How else? They are not known to send the dead — <br>
And not disfigured visibly. His face? — <br>
His hands? She had to look — to ask, <br>
"What was it, dear?" And she had given all <br>
And still she had all — they had — they the lucky! <br>
Wasn't she glad now? Everything seemed won, <br>
And all the rest for them permissable ease. <br>
She had to ask, "What was it, dear?" <br>
"Enough, <br>
Yet not enough. A bullet through and through, <br>
High in the breast. Nothing but what good care <br>
And medicine and rest — and you a week, <br>
Can cure me of to go again." The same <br>
Grim giving to do over for them both. <br>
She dared no more than ask him with her eyes <br>
How was it with him for a second trial. <br>
And with his eyes he asked her not to ask. <br>
They had given him back to her, but not to keep.

The buzz-saw snarled and rattled in the yard<br>
And made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of wood, <br>
Sweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it. <br>
And from there those that lifted eyes could count<br>
Five mountain ranges one behind the other<br>
Under the sunset far into Vermont. <br>
And the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled, <br>

And nothing happened: day was all but done. <br>
Call it a day, I wish they might have said<br>
To please the boy by giving him the half hour<br>
That a boy counts so much when saved from work. <br>
His sister stood beside them in her apron<br>
To tell them 'Supper'. At the word, the saw, <br>
As if to prove saws knew what supper meant, <br>
Leaped out at the boy's hand, or seemed to leap—<br>
He must have given the hand. However it was, <br>
Neither refused the meeting. But the hand! <br>
The boy's first outcry was a rueful laugh. <br>
As he swung toward them holding up the hand<br>
Half in appeal, but half as if to keep<br>
The life from spilling. Then the boy saw all—<br>
Since he was old enough to know, big boy<br>
Doing a man's work, though a child at heart—<br>
He saw all spoiled. 'Don't let him cut my hand off<br>
The doctor, when he comes. Don't let him, sister!'<br>
So. But the hand was gone already. <br>
The doctor put him in the dark of ether. <br>
He lay and puffed his lips out with his breath. <br>

The bird would cease and be as other birds <br>
But that he knows in singing not to sing. <br>
The question that he frames in all but words <br>
Is what to make of a diminished thing.

Out through the fields and the woods <br>

I have climbed the hills of view <br>
And looked at the world, and descended; <br>
I have come by the highway home, <br>
And lo, it is ended. <br>
The leaves are all dead on the ground, <br>
Save those that the oak is keeping <br>
To ravel them one by one <br>
And let them go scraping and creeping <br>
Out over the crusted snow, <br>
When others are sleeping. <br>
And the dead leaves lie huddled and still, <br>
No longer blown hither and thither; <br>
The last lone aster is gone; <br>
The flowers of the <a href=../jones.html#hazel”>witch-hazel</a> wither; <br>
The heart is still aching to seek, <br>
But the feet question 'Whither?' <br>
Ah, when to the heart of man <br>
Was it ever less than a treason <br>
To go with the drift of things, <br>
To yield with a grace to reason, <br>
And bow and accept the end <br>
Of a love or a season?

<P>
<br>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
<br>And sorry I could not travel both
<br>And be one traveller, long I stood
<br>And looked down one as far as I could
<br>To where it bent in the undergrowth;
<P>
<br>Then took the other, as just as fair,
<br>And having perhaps the better claim,
<br>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
<br>Though as for that the passing there
<br>Had worn them really about the same,
<P>
<br>And both that morning equally lay
<br>In leaves no step had trodden black.
<br>Oh, I kept the first for another day!
<br>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
<br>I doubted if I should ever come back.
<P>
<br>I shall be telling this with a sigh
<br>Somewhere ages and ages hence:
<br>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
<br>I took the one less traveled by,

I WONDER about the trees. <br>
Why do we wish to bear <br>
Forever the noise of these <br>
More than another noise <br>
So close to our dwelling place? <br> 
We suffer them by the day <br>
Till we lose all measure of pace, <br> 
And fixity in our joys, <br>
And acquire a listening air. <br>
They are that that talks of going <br>
But never gets away; <br>
And that talks no less for knowing, <br>
As it grows wiser and older, <br>
That now it means to stay. <br>
My feet tug at the floor <br>
And my head sways to my shoulder <br>
Sometimes when I watch trees sway, <br>
From the window or the door. <br>
I shall set forth for somewhere, <br>
I shall make the reckless choice <br>
Some day when they are in voice <br>
And tossing so as to scare <br>
The white clouds over them on. <br> 
I shall have less to say, But I shall be gone.

<h2><I>The Tuft of Flowers</h2></I>
<blockquote><p>
I went to turn the grass once after one <br>
Who mowed it in the dew before the sun. <br>
The dew was gone that made his blade so keen<br> 
Before I came to view the leveled scene. <br>
I looked for him behind an isle of trees; <br>
I listened for his whetstone on the breeze. <br>
But he had gone his way, the grass all mown, <br>
And I must be, as he had been,—alone, <br>
'As all must be,' I said within my heart, <br>
'Whether they work together or apart.' <br>
But as I said it, swift there passed me by <br>
On noiseless wing a 'wildered butterfly, <br>
Seeking with memories grown dim o'er night <br>
Some resting flower of yesterday's delight. <br>
And once I marked his flight go round and round, <br> 
As where some flower lay withering on the ground. <br>
And then he flew as far as eye could see, <br>
And then on tremulous wing came back to me. <br> 
I thought of questions that have no reply, <br>
And would have turned to toss the grass to dry; <br> 
But he turned first, and led my eye to look <br>
At a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook, <br>
A leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared <br>
Beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared. <br>
I left my place to know them by their name, <br>
Finding them butterfly weed when I came. <br>
The mower in the dew had loved them thus, <br>
By leaving them to flourish, not for us, <br>
Nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him. <br>
But from sheer morning gladness at the brim. <br>
The butterfly and I had lit upon, <br>
Nevertheless, a message from the dawn, <br>
That made me hear the wakening birds around, <br>
And hear his long scythe whispering to the ground, <br>
And feel a spirit kindred to my own; <br>
So that henceforth I worked no more alone; <br>
But glad with him, I worked as with his aid, <br>
And weary, sought at noon with him the shade; <br>
And dreaming, as it were, held brotherly speech <br>
With one whose thought I had not hoped to reach. <br>
'Men work together,' I told him from the heart, <Br>
'Whether they work together or apart.' <br>
And would suffice.

<h2><I>Wild Grapes </h2></I>
<blockquote><p>

What tree may not the fig be gathered from? <br>
The grape may not be gathered from the birch? <br>
It's 
<a target=top href=../writing/chuang/equal.html>all you know</a> the grape, or know the birch. <br>
As a girl gathered from the birch myself <br>
Equally with my weight in grapes, one autumn, <br>
I ought to know what tree the grape is fruit of. <br>
I was born, I suppose, like anyone, <br>
And grew to be a little boyish girl <br>
My brother could not always leave at home. <br>
But that beginning was wiped out in fear <br>
The day I swung suspended with the grapes, <br>
And was come after like Eurydice <br>
And brought down safely from the upper regions; <br>
And the life I live now's an extra life <br>
I can waste as I please on whom I please. <br>
So if you see me celebrate two birthdays, <br>
And give myself out of two different ages, <br>
One of them five years younger than I look— <br>
One day my brother led me to a glade <br>
Where a white birch he knew of stood alone, <br>
Wearing a thin head-dress of pointed leaves, <br>
And heavy on her heavy hair behind, <br>
Against her neck, an ornament of grapes. <br>
Grapes, I knew grapes from having seen them last year. <br>
One bunch of them, and there began to be <br>
Bunches all round me growing in white birches, <br> 
The way they grew round Leif the Lucky's German; <br>
Mostly as much beyond my lifted hands, though, <br>
As the moon used to seem when I was younger, <br>
And only freely to be had for climbing. <br>
My brother did the climbing; and at first <br>
Threw me down grapes to miss and scatter <br>
And have to hunt for in sweet fern and hardhack; <br> 
Which gave him some time to himself to eat, <br>
But not so much, perhaps, as a boy needed. <br>
So then, to make me wholly self-supporting, <br>
He climbed still higher and bent the tree to earth <br>
And put it in my hands to pick my own grapes. <br>
"Here, take a tree-top, I'll get down another. <br>
Hold on with all your might when I let go." <br>
I said I had the tree. It wasn't true. <br>
The opposite was true. The tree had me. <br> 
The minute it was left with me alone <br>
It caught me up as if I were the fish <br>
And it the fishpole. So I was translated <br>
To loud cries from my brother of "Let go! <br>
Don't you know anything, you girl? Let go!" <br>
But I, with something of the baby grip <br>
Acquired ancestrally in just such trees <br>
When wilder mothers than our wildest now <br>
Hung babies out on branches by the hands <br>
To dry or wash or tan, I don't know which, <br>
(You'll have to ask an evolutionist)— <br>
I held on uncomplainingly for life. <br>
My brother tried to make me laugh to help me. <br>
"What are you doing up there in those grapes? <br>
Don't be afraid. A few of them won't hurt you. <br>
I mean, they won't pick you if you don't them." <br>
Much danger of my picking anything! <br>
By that time I was pretty well reduced <br>
To a philosophy of hang-and-let-hang. <br>
"Now you know how it feels," my brother said, <br> 
"To be a bunch of fox-grapes, as they call them, <br>
That when it thinks it has escaped the fox <br>
By growing where it shouldn't—on a birch, <br>
Where a fox wouldn't think to look for it— <br>
And if he looked and found it, couldn't reach it—<br> 
Just then come you and I to gather it. <br>
Only you have the advantage of the grapes <br>
In one way: you have one more stem to cling by, <br> 
And promise more resistance to the picker." <br>
One by one I lost off my hat and shoes, <br>
And still I clung. I let my head fall back, <br>
And shut my eyes against the sun, my ears <br>
Against my brother's nonsense; "Drop," he said, <br>
"I'll catch you in my arms. It isn't far." <br>
(Stated in lengths of him it might not be.) <br>
"Drop or I'll shake the tree and shake you down." <br> 
Grim silence on my part as I sank lower, <br>
My small wrists stretching till they showed the banjo strings. <br>
"Why, if she isn't serious about it! <br>
Hold tight awhile till I think what to do. <br> 
I'll bend the tree down and let you down by it." <br>
I don't know much about the letting down; <br>
But once I felt ground with my stocking feet <br>
And the world came revolving back to me, <br>
I know I looked long at my curled-up fingers, <br>
Before I straightened them and brushed the bark off. <br> 
My brother said: "Don't you weigh anything? <br>
Try to weigh something next time, so you won't <br>
Be run off with by birch trees into space." <br>
It wasn't my not weighing anything <br>
So much as my not knowing anything— <br>
My brother had been nearer right before. <br>
I had not taken the first step in knowledge; <br>
I had not learned to let go with the hands, <br>
As still I have not learned to with the heart, <br>
And have no wish to with the heart—nor need, <br>
That I can see. The mind—is not the heart. <br>
I may yet live, as I know others live, <br>
To wish in vain to let go with the mind— <br>
<a target=top href="../defenses.html#anticipation">Of cares, at night</a>, to sleep; but nothing tells me<br> 
That I need learn to let go with the heart.

<p>
<br>Out walking in the frozen swamp one gray day
<br>I paused and said, 'I will turn back from here.
<br>No, I will go on farther - and we shall see'.
<br>The hard snow held me, save where now and then
<br>One foot went through. The view was all in lines
<br>Straight up and down of tall slim trees
<br>Too much alike to mark or name a place by
<br>So as to say for certain I was here
<br>Or somewhere else: I was just far from home.
<br>A small bird flew before me. He was careful
<br>To put a tree between us when he lighted,
<br>And say no word to tell me who he was
<br>Who was so foolish as to think what he thought.
<br>He thought that I was after him for a feather—
<br>The white one in his tail; like one who takes
<br>Everything said as personal to himself.
<br>One flight out sideways would have undeceived him.
<br>And then there was a pile of wood for which
<br>I forgot him and let his little fear
<br>Carry him off the way I might have gone,
<br>Without so much as wishing him good-night.
<br>He went behind it to make his last stand.
<br>It was a cord of maple, cut and split
<br>And piled and measured, four by four by eight.
<br>And not another like it could I see.
<br>No runner tracks in this year's snow looped near it.
<br>And it was older sure than this year's cutting,
<br>Or even last year's or the year's before.
<br>The wood was gray and the bark warping off it
<br>And the pile somewhat sunken. Clematis
<br>Had wound strings round and round it like a bundle.
<br>What held it though on one side was a tree
<br>Still growing, and on one a stake and prop,
<br>These latter about to fall. I thought that only
<br>Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks
<br>Could so forget his handiwork on which
<br>He spent himself the labour of his axe,
<br>And leave it there far from a useful fireplace
<br>To warm the frozen swamp as best it could
<br>With the slow smokeless burning of decay.
