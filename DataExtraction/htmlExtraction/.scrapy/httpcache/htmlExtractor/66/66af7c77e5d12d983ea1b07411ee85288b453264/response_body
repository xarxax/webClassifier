J&uuml;nger is still working at 102</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">By Consul B. John
Zavrel</FONT></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Writer against spelling reform -
Confidence in today's youth - Wife Liselotte is his good
spirit</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">"I work only three or four hours a
day," says the 102-year old Ernst J&uuml;nger. On March 29, he will
celebrate his birthday with his wife Liselotte in Wilflingen, his
residence since 1950. She is his "good spirit", intelligent
confidante, and guardian of his valuable time. "I am now working on
my diaries," said J&uuml;nger a few days before his birthday. Volume
V of "Seventy Years Gone By" will be published next by Klett-Cotta in
Stuttgart.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">That he will again receive birthday
wishes from all over the world is quite normal. On his 100th birthday
yet, French President Francois Mitterrand, who has since passed away,
wrote a homage to the "great German". Among the guests at
J&uuml;nger's lodge in the Swabian mountains were Chancellor Helmut
Kohl and Finance Minister Theo Weigel. They, too, were impressed with
the obvious vitality of the upright man with the light blue eyes and
the handsome head of a Roman emperor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">His fame was not planned, says the
man of letters and knight of the Alexander Order for Art and Science.
Discipline, order, and work laid the foundation for his situation
today. His fascination with words prompted him to become a writer. It
comes as no surprise that J&uuml;nger considers the present
controversy over spelling reform in Germany to be superfluous,
"because it does not make anything easier; rather, it obscures the
origin of words." He thinks more highly of the younger generation in
Germany. "They are better that their reputation," he says. To the
question, after living a full and eventful life, of what advice he
has to give to young people on the subject of personal involvement
and the fulfillment of duty, the master responds: "Absolutely
nothing, for they won't listen to it!"</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This must also have been true for the
parents of Ernst J&uuml;nger, born on March 29, 1885 in Heidelberg.
At the age of six, he smoked his first cigarette, J&uuml;nger recalls
very clearly today. And even now, he does not deny himself this
pleasure: "I like to smoke." Moreover, the 102-year old allows
himself yet another luxury. He doesn't get up until 9 a.m. At one
time, he was up with the birds, says the enthusiastic beetle
collector.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">To an even greater extent than
Gerhart Hauptmann, former recipient of the Nobel Prize for
literature, J&uuml;nger is already a legend in his own time: highly
esteemed even as a young man, but also much criticized. "The hate of
one's enemies heightens the myth," says J&uuml;nger to console
himself, as in 1982 he accepts the Goethe Prize under public protest
in the city of Frankfurt. The fact that J&uuml;nger had enlisted
voluntarily in World War I and acquired early renown with his epic of
war caused a great stir. He is now the only living recipient of the
"Pour le merite" Medal for Bravery. After 1945, the number of his
readers and admirers increased in Japan and the United States as
well. In Germany, the author of ImStahlgewitter (In Storms of Steel)
was considered by many to be a glorifier of war and a forerunner of
the National Socialists. "Anyone who has lived to old age has
experienced much, and also vice versa," said J&uuml;nger in an
interview.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">While still in high school,
J&uuml;nger joined the Wandervogel youth movement. Before his
graduation, he ran off to join the Foreign Legion. His father hauled
him back, but on the day World War I broke out, the 19-year old
enlisted. He was soon fighting as a raid leader on the Western front.
In a diary entitled In Storms of Steel, published in 1920, he
described the action he saw as a bloody experience, far removed from
the boredom of daily bourgeois life, an intoxicating challenge. Eight
times he was wounded. The 23-year-old officer was in the hospital
when the war ended. With his first book, J&uuml;nger had already
found the central theme of his life's work: Only in extreme
situations is man fully alive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In the years that followed,
J&uuml;nger studied zoology and philosophy, started a family, and as
a free-lance writer, published right-wing articles. The zenith of his
"heroic nihilism" came in 1932 with the piece entitled "The Worker -
Rule and Form". As the meaning of his existence on the treshold of a
new age, J&uuml;nger propagated work in itself: "The task of total
mobilization is the transformation of life into energy as it is
revealed in the turning of the wheels of economics, technology and
trade, and on the battlefield in firing and action."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">J&uuml;nger spoke later of his
"alarming mistake". To reject the whole of his work on the basis of
these early writings would be doing him an injustice, said author
Wolf Jobst Siddler at the awarding of the Goethe Prize.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Despite lows, he remains
optimistic</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The National Socialists courted
J&uuml;nger, but he turned down a seat in the Reichstag. In 1933 he
moved from Berlin to the Bodensee. The Socialist Ernst Niekisch, for
whose periodical J&uuml;nger wrote, believed that it had been
primarily the "spirit of vulgarity" that had put him off. J&uuml;nger
expressed his aversion in the 1939 novel Auf den Marmorklippen (On
the Marble Cliffs) in which an ancient pastoral folk, under the
leadership of the "head forester", conquer and destroy the highly
advanced culture of the neighboring country.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">During World War II, J&uuml;nger
served, with Hitler's approval, as a reserve officer in occupied
Paris, until he was discharged on July 20, 1944 as "unfit for
service". At the time, his work Peace was in circulation, in which he
promotes European cooperation. It is dedicated to his son Ernst, who
fell as a German soldier in Italy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Today, looking back on his life,
J&uuml;nger hopes that the democratic form of government can solve
the problems of society. In spite of all the highs and lows in his
life, he remains an optimist, says J&uuml;nger. For him, the
following holds true: "In all cases, hope takes us further than
fear."</FONT></P>
