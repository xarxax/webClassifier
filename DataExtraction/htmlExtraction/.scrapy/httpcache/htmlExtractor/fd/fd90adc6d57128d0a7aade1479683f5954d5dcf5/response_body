      <h3 class="style1">A Message to my  customers ( all of whom have been my Friends in  Business).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After 30 years of exporting our very special  product to happy customers in 128 countries I have reluctantly made the  decision to close the business.&nbsp; This decision has been made necessary by  the fact that we exported 97% of our production and for the last 13 years we  have been &lsquo;tortured&rsquo; by currency exchange rates greatly reducing our return on  all other currencies with all our production costs rising at the same  time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes more recently are in the right direction but not  enough to restore viability. </h3>
                <h3 class="style1">I want to thank all the wonderful people  around the world we have served and with whom we have formed friendships.&nbsp;  Sorry I have not been able to make contact with you all to keep you updated.  &nbsp;</h3>
                <h3 class="style1">Thanks and Best Wishes from myself and from  my son Wayne who has been the mainstay of the business on the manufacturing  side.</h3>
