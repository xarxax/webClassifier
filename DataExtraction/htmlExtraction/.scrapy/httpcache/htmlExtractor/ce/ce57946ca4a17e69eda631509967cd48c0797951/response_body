<DT><font size="+1">T</font>HE night is darkening round me,
<DT>The wild winds coldly blow;
<DT>But a tyrant spell has bound me
<DT>And I cannot, cannot go.
<p>
<DT>The giant trees are bending
<DT>Their bare boughs weighed with snow,
<DT>And the storm is fast descending
<DT>And yet I cannot go.
<p>
<DT>Clouds beyond clouds above me,
<DT>Wastes beyond wastes below;
<DT>But nothing drear can move me;
<DT>I will not, cannot go.<P>

<ul><DL><P>
<Dt><font size="+1">C</font>OLD in the earth, and the deep snow piled above thee!
<Dt>Far, far removed, cold in the dreary grave!
<Dt>Have I forgot, my only love, to love thee,
<Dt>Severed at last by Time's all-wearing wave?
<P>
<Dt>Now, when alone, do my thoughts no longer hover
<Dt>Over the mountains on Angora's shore,
<Dt>Resting their wings, where heath and fern-leaves cover
<Dt>That noble heart for ever, ever more?
<P>
<Dt>Cold in the earth, and fifteen wild Decembers
<Dt>From these brown hills have melted into Spring.
<Dt>Faithful indeed is the spirit that remembers
<Dt>After such years of change and suffering!
<P>
<Dt>Sweet love of youth, forgive if I forget thee
<Dt>While the world's tide is bearing me along;
<Dt>Sterner desires and darker hopes beset me,
<Dt>Hopes which obscure but cannot do thee wrong.
<P>
<Dt>No other sun has brightened up my heaven,
<Dt>No other star has ever shone for me;
<Dt>All my life's bliss from thy dear life was given,
<Dt>All my life's bliss is in the grave with thee.
<P>
<Dt>But when my days of golden dreams had perished,
<Dt>And even Despair was powerless to destroy,
<Dt>Then did I learn how existence might be cherished,
<Dt>Strengthened and fed without the aid of joy.
<P>
<Dt>Then did I check my tears of useless passion,
<Dt>Weaned my young soul from yearning after thine,
<Dt>Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten
<Dt>Down to that grave already more than mine!
<P>
<Dt>And even now, I dare not let it languish,
<Dt>Dare not indulge in Memory's rapturous pain;
<Dt>Once drinking deep of that divinest anguish,
<Dt>How could I seek the empty world again?

<ul><DL><P>
<dt><font size="+1">A</font> LITTLE while, a little while,
<dt>The noisy crowd are barred away;
<dt>And I can sing and I can smile
<dt>A little while I've holyday!
<p>
<dt>Where wilt thou go, my harrased heart?
<dt>Full many a land invites thee now;
<dt>And places near and far apart
<dt>Have rest for thee, my weary brow.
<p>
<dt>There is a spot 'mid barren hills
<dt>Where winter howls and driving rain,
<dt>But if the weary tempest chills
<dt>There is a light that warms again.
<p>
<dt>The house is old, the trees are bare,
<dt>And moonless bends the misty dome,
<dt>But what on earth is half so dear,
<dt>So longed for as the hearth of home?
<p>
<dt>The mute bird sitting on the stone,
<dt>The dank moss dripping from the wall,
<dt>The garden walk with weeds o'ergrown,
<dt>I love them--how I love them all!
<p>
<dt> * * * * *
<p>
<dt>Yes, as I mused, the naked room,
<dt>The flickering firelight died away,
<dt>And from the midst of cheerless gloom
<dt>I passed to bright, unclouded day--
<p>
<dt>A little and a lone green lane
<dt>That opened on a common wide;
<dt>A distant, dreary, dim blue chain
<dt>Of mountains circling every side;
<p>
<dt>A heaven so clear, an earth so calm,
<dt>So sweet, so soft, so hushed an air
<dt>And, deepening still the dream-like charm,
<dt>Wild moor-sheep feeding everywhere--
<p>
<dt>That was the scene; I knew it well,
<dt>I knew the path-ways far and near
<dt>That, winding o'er each billowy swell,
<dt>Marked out the tracks of wandering deer.
<p>
<dt>Could I have lingered but an hour
<dt>It well had paid a week of toil,
<dt>But truth has banished fancy's power;
<dt>I hear my dungeon bars recoil--
<P>
<dt>Even as I stood with raptured eye,
<dt>Absorbed in bliss, so deep and dear,
<dt>My hour of rest had fleeted by
<dt>And given me back to weary care.

<ul><DL><P>
<dd>  <font size="+1">N</font>O coward soul is mine,
<dt>No trembler in the world's storm-troubled sphere;
<dd>  I see Heaven's glories shine,
<dt>And Faith shines equal, arming me from fear.
<p>
<dd>  O God within my breast,
<dt>Almighty, ever-present Deity!
<dd>  Life--that in me has rest,
<dt>As I--undying Life--have power in Thee!
<p>
<dd>  Vain are the thousand creeds
<dt>That move men's hearts--unutterably vain;
<dd>  Worthless as withered weeds,
<dt>Or idlest froth amid the boundless main,
<p>
<dd>  To waken doubt in one
<dt>Holding so fast by Thine infinity;
<dd>  So surely anchored on
<dt>The steadfast rock of immortality.
<p>
<dd>  With wide-embracing love
<dt>Thy spirit animates eternal years
<dd>  Pervades and broods above,
<dt>Changes, sustains, dissolves, creates, and rears.
<p>
<dd>  Though earth and man were gone,
<dt>And suns and universes ceased to be,
<dd>  And Thou were left alone,
<dt>Every existence would exist in Thee.
<p>
<dd>  There is not room for Death,
<dt>Nor atom that his might could render void;
<dd>  Thou--Thou art Being and Breath,
<dt>And what Thou art may never be destroyed.

<dt>I've watched thee every hour--

<p>
<dt>Few hearts to mortals given

<dt>Man's spirit away from its drear dungeon sending,
<dt>Bursting the fetters and breaking the bars.
<p>
<dt>All down the mountain sides wild forests lending
<dt>One mighty voice to the life-giving wind,
<dt>Rivers their banks in their jubilee rending,
<dt>Fast through the valleys a reckless course wending,
<dt>Wider and deeper their waters extending,
<dt>Leaving a desolate desert behind.
<p>
<dt>Shining and lowering and swelling and dying,
<dt>Changing forever from midnight to noon;
<dt>Roaring like thunder, like soft music sighing,
<dt>Shadows on shadows advancing and flying,
<dt>Lighning-bright flashes the deep gloom defying,
<dt>Coming as swiftly and fading as soon.

<ul><DL><P>
<dt><font size="+1">C</font>ome hither, child--who gifted thee
<dt>With power to touch that string so well?
<dt>How darest thou rouse up thoughts in me,
<dt>Thoughts that I would--but cannot quell?
<p>
<dt>Nay, chide not, lady; long ago
<dt>I heard those notes in Ula's hall,
<dt>And had I known they'd waken woe
<dt>I'd weep their music to recall.
<p>
<dt>But thus it was: one festal night
<dt>When I was hardly six years old
<dt>I stole away from crowds and light
<dt>And sought a chamber dark and cold.
<p>
<dt>I had no one to love me there,
<dt>I knew no comrade and no friend;
<dt>And so I went to sorrow where
<dt>Heaven, only heaven saw me bend.
<p>
<dt>Loud blew the wind; 'twas sad to stay
<dt>From all that splendour barred away.
<dt>I imaged in the lonely room
<dt>A thousand forms of fearful gloom.
<p>
<dt>And with my wet eyes raised on high
<dt>I prayed to God that I might die.
<dt>Suddenly in that silence drear
<dt>A sound of music reached my ear,
<p>
<dt>And then a note, I hear it yet,
<dt>So full of soul, so deeply sweet,
<dt>I thought that Gabriel's self had come
<dt>To take me to thy father's home.
<p>
<dt>Three times it rose, that seraph strain,
<dt>Then died, nor breathed again;
<dt>But still the words and still the tone
<dt>Dwell round my heart when all alone.

<dt>Telling not of storms tomorrow;

<p>
<dt>O, I'm gone back to the days of youth,
<dt>I am a child once more,
<dt>And 'neath my father's sheltering roof
<dt>And near the old hall door
<p>
<dt>I watch this cloudy evening fall
<dt>After a day of rain;
<dt>Blue mists, sweet mists of summer pall
<dt>The horizon's mountain chain.
<p>
<dt>The damp stands on the long green grass
<dt>As thick as morning's tears,
<dt>And dreamy scents of fragrance pass
<dt>That breathe of other years.

<UL><DL><P>
<dt><font size="+1">O</font>FTEN rebuked, yet always back returning
<dd>  To those first feelings that were born with me,
<dt>And leaving busy chase of wealth and learning
<dd>  For idle dreams of things which cannot be:<p>
<dt>Today, I will not seek the shadowy region;
<dd>  Its unsustaining vastness waxes drear;
<dt>And visions rising, legion after legion,
<dd>  Bring the unreal world too strangely near. <p>
<dt>I'll walk, but not in old heroic traces,
<dd>  And not in paths of high morality,
<dt>And not among the half-distinguished faces,
<dt>The clouded forms of long-past history. <p>
<dt>I'll walk where my own nature would be leading:
<dd>  It vexes me to choose another guide:
<dt>Where the grey flocks in ferny glens are feeding;
<dd>  Where the wild wind blows on the mountain-side. <p>
<dt>What have those lonely mountains worth revealing?
<dd>  More glory, and more grief, than I can tell:
<dt>The earth that wakes one human heart to feeling
<dd>  Can centre both the worlds of Heaven and Hell.
