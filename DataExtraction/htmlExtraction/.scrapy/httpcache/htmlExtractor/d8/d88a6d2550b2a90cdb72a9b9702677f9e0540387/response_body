<P><B>North American Dhrupad Association (NADA)</B></P>

<P>The North American Dhrupad Association (NADA) was formed as
a non-profit organization in Los Angeles, by Sunil Dutta, in 1996
for the specific purpose of supporting and disseminating Dhrupad
music in India and in the U.S. The main objectives of NADA are:</P>

<P>a) Prepare and maintain an archive of musical recordings, research
documents, and relevant data associated with Dhrupad.</P>

<P>b) Organize concerts in which the master artists perform. The
concerts will be organized to generate interest in the public
for this musical form.</P>

<P>c) Support the master artists in various ways, so that they
can focus on their art and transfer knowledge to the students.</P>

<P>d) Support the learners of Dhrupad, so that they can dedicate
themselves to learning of this art.</P>

<P>NADA has already instituted scholarships for students of Dhrupad.
NADA would like to expand this scholarship to at least five more
students. NADA is also engaged in a number of other activities
to preserve and propagate the Dhrupad tradition. Among other ideas,
NADA is exporing steps that can be taken to keep alive the endangered
craftsmanship which goes into making the Rudra Veena. NADA members
are volunteers who are truly interested in Dhrupad. Dhrupad maestros
such as Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar, Ustad Asad Ali Khan, Ritwik
Sanyal, F Wasifuddin Dagar, Bahauddin Dagar, Uday Bhawalkar, Gundecha
Brothers, Falguni Mitra, Prem Kumar Mallik, and others are members
of NADA. The members seek to fulfill the goals of NADA and to
promote Dhrupad music.</P>
